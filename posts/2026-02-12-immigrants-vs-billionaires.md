We’ve shipped a small side-project:

<a href="/immigrants-vs-billionaires/">Immigrants vs Billionaires</a>

The underlying point is simple:

- Immigration is often talked about as a pure cost, when the evidence usually shows mixed effects and significant upside.
- Large-scale extraction, market concentration, and tax leakage are discussed less, despite being a major drag in many sectors.

It's a complex field with no hard figures, so we’re using arguable assumptions, rough splits, and scenario toggles to show direction and scale that holds up, and all sources are linked.

If you disagree with assumptions, great, that’s the point. Toggle them, push them around, and see what has to be true for the story to flip.
