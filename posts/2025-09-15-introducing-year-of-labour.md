We’re publishing the first edition of our report, “A Year of Labour”. It looks at what the Labour government has done since the July 2024 election and what it means for Britain.

What’s inside:

- Short, readable policy write‑ups each scored from −2 to +2
- Sources and citations inline, so you can check the claims
- A catalogue grouped by topic, plus a summary/conclusion and known issues

How to read the scores:

- −2/−1: Evidence points negative; likely to make outcomes worse
- 0: Too early or unclear; keep watching the data
- +1/+2: Evidence points positive; early delivery looks promising

Start here:

- Introduction and approach: see the report’s [Introduction](../year-of-labour.html#introduction) section
- Check the [policy group summary scores table](../year-of-labour.html#score-summary)
- Methodology, scoring and taxonomy: how we structure and score items
- Jump straight to the [policy catalogue](../year-of-labour.html#21-energy-climate-and-nuclear), or read the [conclusion](../year-of-labour.html#30-conclusions)
