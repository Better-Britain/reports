Better Britain Bureau is an independent, Manchester‑rooted, AI‑aware think tank. Our aim is simple: make complex issues easy to understand and hard to ignore, so people can see clearly and build better.

What we’re building:

- Clear, readable reports that surface the signal over the noise
- Evidence‑led analysis with citations, data, and lived reality
- Practical recommendations over point‑scoring and outrage cycles

How we work (in brief):

- Collect and qualify research; structure it into data
- Layer real meaning and context; check intent vs outcome
- Write plainly; remove waffle; welcome corrections

What to expect here:

- National and local reports as they go live
- Occasional posts that announce releases, explain methods, or call for contributors
