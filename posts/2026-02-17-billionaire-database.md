description: A source-linked sticker-book of billionaires — how they get rich, how they keep control, and what we can actually say with receipts.

We’ve shipped a new side-quest:

<a href="/billionaire-database/">Billionaire database</a>

It’s a filterable, source-linked sticker-book: each card has a short profile, a handful of stats (only what we can justify), and “Receipts” you can open to see the sources.
