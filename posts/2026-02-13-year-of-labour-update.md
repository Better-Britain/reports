- **Water reform**: the government’s new direction for how the system is meant to be run and regulated.
- **Housing and planning**: major renters’ rights changes, planning reform, and the national plan on homelessness.
- **Work and enforcement**: new workplace rights law and the planned enforcement body/timetable.
- **Migration and asylum**: new legislation and the latest policy direction on returns and removals.
- **Justice**: sentencing reform.
- **Digital rules**: clearer standards for digital ID, and Online Safety enforcement moving from theory to practice.
- **The “money and rules” backdrop**: the Budget and Finance Bill, plus the planned carbon border tax (a charge on high‑carbon imports).
