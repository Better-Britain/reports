We’ve shipped another side-quest:

<a href="/what-brexit-costs/">Brexit: a trillion pounds and counting…</a>

The headline point is not “what we pay the EU”. It’s the long-run gap: the UK economy being smaller than a no‑Brexit baseline year after year — and what that implies for receipts and public services.

The page includes:

- A live “Brexit Benefits” counter.
- An interactive chart you can toggle to see different effects.
- A “Here’s what we could have won” board that turns the scale into real things: hospitals, nurses, police, homes, insulation, teachers...
