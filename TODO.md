# TODOs

- Addition/change log, and flagging recent updates on ui.
- Nicer nav menus, they kinda suck
- Rename to 'Labour report card' or similar, not time-linked
- Some entries have multiple citations to the same document, not a problem everywhere, but some entries really need deeper research to support some claims.
    - A helper script that checks entry source coverage/diversity will help
