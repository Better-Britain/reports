# Gaming and Radicalisation, from the Inside (Placeholder)

This is a placeholder connected to our OSA explainer. The final report will cover:

- Platforms' responsibilities and failures: Steam's lack of moderation; Xbox review racist dogwhistles
- How ragebait, outrage algorithms, and influencer ecosystems feed radicalisation cycles
- The spectrum of "gamers": from console/PC to mobile (The Sims, Candy Crush)
- Overlaps with social platforms (Instagram, Facebook) and discovery mechanics
- "Manufactured disconsent" vs "manufactured discontent" â€” discontent makes you unhappy with the state of the world; disconsent pushes rejection of lawmakers and governance altogether
- Recommendations for platforms, Ofcom/DSIT, and civil society on interventions and comms
- How government can better communicate to gamers at all levels (including mobile), aligning OSA duties with practical, trusted messaging across the channels they already use
- How psychology makes gamers a particularly appealing target for agitators

Full report coming soon.
