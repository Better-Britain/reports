But the subculture has proven attractive to extremists for two reasons.

Second, gamers are already used to fantasy role-play and combat, making it easier to introduce narratives of heroic struggle (us vs. them, defend your people, etc.) that extremist ideologies use. Psychological research supports this linkage: games can increase one’s sense of “perceived self-efficacy” in relation to violence. In a game, you are powerful; you succeed through violence; you feel in control. Extremist groups tap into that by telling recruits they can be powerful warriors in real life.
