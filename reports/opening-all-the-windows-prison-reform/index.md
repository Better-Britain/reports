# Opening All The Windows on Prison Reform (Placeholder)

This is a placeholder. The final report will explore:

- A full spectrum of ideas on crime, punishment and rehabilitation
- How the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) protects citizens
- Claims about leaving the ECHR to enable tougher regimes, and real constraints
- Evidence on what reduces reoffending and improves public safety

Full report coming soon.
