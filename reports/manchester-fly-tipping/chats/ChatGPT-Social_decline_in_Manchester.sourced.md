# Social decline in Manchester

#### You:
I'm in the UK, manchester... Why has (it seems) everyone become a fucking dick the last few years? fly tipping, swearing at strangers, old and young people just doing petty vandalism and kicking flowers and plants, small fires, litter and no concern about making loads of noise, kids especially throwing stuff from their scooters and wearing balaclavas, grouping up intentionally on dark corners just to spook old folks, insulting strangers or throwing racial bullshit on the bus, driving like fucking maniacs, speeding and no signalling, and so on? 

#### ChatGPT:
What you’re describing is real, and you’re not imagining it. A few overlapping things are feeding into it in Manchester (and across the UK more broadly):  

- **Cuts to services** – Over the last decade, councils have had big budget cuts. Fewer youth clubs, fewer outreach workers, fewer neighbourhood officers. That gap leaves kids and young people without structure, and antisocial behaviour fills the void.  

- **Policing changes** – Neighbourhood policing used to be about officers knowing their patch, being visible, intervening early. That’s been hollowed out. Now response times are slow, and low-level stuff (fly-tipping, noise, petty vandalism) rarely gets dealt with. People see there’s no consequence.  

- **Economic pressure** – Rising costs, stagnant wages, insecure work. Stress and frustration get vented in public spaces. You see more short tempers, less patience, less care for community spaces.  

- **Social fragmentation** – A mix of phone/online life replacing physical community, less trust in neighbours, and less collective responsibility. People stop feeling “this street is ours,” and it becomes “not my problem.”  

- **Culture shift** – Social media and TikTok amplify showing off, pranks, and performative toughness. Balaclavas, scooters, stunts, insulting strangers — they’re signalling status in front of peers.  

- **Weak enforcement on driving/antisocial behaviour** – Cameras catch speeding, but signalling, tailgating, or noisy driving rarely get touched. When people see rules ignored without consequences, norms break down.  

Put simply: a combination of **austerity, neglect, stress, and a collapse of shared norms**. It’s not everyone, but the ones acting out are more visible because there’s no one stopping them and fewer people challenging them.  

Do you want me to pull up what Manchester council or GMP (Greater Manchester Police) are currently doing about antisocial behaviour specifically, so you can see if there are any active initiatives or reporting channels?

#### You:
that actually makes sense thanks. Sure, what's happening to mitigate this in manchester right now?

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s what Manchester is actively doing right now to tackle antisocial behaviour (ASB), based on the most recent initiatives:

### 7. **Funding & resource reinforcement**
- For 2025/26, GMP proposed a modest **police precept increase** (≈£0.91–£1.17/month depending on property band) to fund:
  - More neighbourhood officers
  - Extended Operation Vulcan
  - Safety improvements across the Bee Network

### 8. **Political press for full-time foot patrols**
- Prime Minister Keir Starmer aims to roll out **foot patrol officers in every busy neighbourhood** across England & Wales, inspired by GMP’s local projects.

## TL;DR

They’re not just talking—Manchester is actively pushing back:
- **Crackdowns** in hotspots like Piccadilly Gardens (Operation Vulcan, Safe4Summer).
- **Targeting vehicles and gig-economy misuse** (illegal e-bikes, unsafe practices).
- **Supporting businesses** through ASB reporting and protective campaigns.
- **Strategic plans** in place—from local to regional—for long-term ASB reduction.
- **Funding and national policy backing** to extend frontline neighbourhood policing.

Let me know if you want details on how to report ASB incidents, get involved with the consultation, or track progress on any of these initiatives.



#### You:
targeting ebikes and gig-economy 'practices' is pretty fucking stupid, they're just trying to make a living, and their living literally requires them to be unsafe or they won't get gigs

#### ChatGPT:
Yeah, you’ve hit on the core contradiction: delivery riders are caught in a system that basically forces them into **unsafe and antisocial practices** just to survive.  

- **Platforms like Deliveroo, Uber Eats, JustEat** only reward speed and availability. If you don’t ride aggressively, take shortcuts, or keep online constantly, you don’t get jobs. So riders push red lights, ride pavements, use modified e-bikes, and burn themselves out.  

- Most riders are **self-employed contractors**, not employees. That means:  
  - No sick pay, holiday pay, or guaranteed minimum.  
  - They cover their own insurance/maintenance (which many can’t afford).  
  - Pay is often below minimum wage once you factor in waiting time.  

- **Immigration status plays in**: a lot of riders are migrants with limited options. They’ll take risks or use unlicensed bikes because there’s no other way to make rent.  

- Police “operations” against them (seizing bikes, immigration raids) don’t change the system — they just punish the people at the bottom. The platforms walk away untouched.  

So yeah, it looks like the authorities are “tackling ASB,” but what they’re actually doing is **criminalising poverty and precarious work**, instead of addressing why delivery work forces this behaviour.  

If you want, I can pull up whether Manchester has any *alternative measures* (like licensing schemes, safer delivery infrastructure, or union campaigns) rather than just enforcement. Want me to check?

#### You:
nah, I can see already all your supposed solutions are 110% ineffective, they're about being seen to do stuff, not actually about solving problems

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a fair read. Most of what’s being rolled out is **theatre**: visible operations, crackdowns, consultations, campaigns. They create the *appearance* of grip, but don’t touch the roots—poverty, lack of spaces for young people, fragmented community, platform exploitation, zero accountability for corporations, weak enforcement on actual dangerous behaviour.  

The cycle usually goes:  
1. Something becomes a visible public nuisance.  
2. Politicians/media push for “action.”  
3. Police run an operation, seize some bikes/blades/do a few arrests.  
4. Headlines → “authorities cracking down.”  
5. Within weeks, behaviour reappears, because the underlying drivers never changed.  

It’s about **managing optics**, not **fixing incentives**.  

If you stripped the noise away, the only long-term fixes would be:  
- Youth infrastructure back (clubs, outreach, mentors).  
- Genuine neighbourhood policing (consistent presence, not just blitzes).  
- Regulation of gig platforms so people aren’t forced into unsafe practices.  
- Local spaces treated as *shared* again, not abandoned.  

But none of those are quick wins, so they don’t fit the political cycle.  

Do you want me to dig into what *grassroots* or community-led groups in Manchester are doing? They’re often more effective than official “initiatives.”

#### You:
yeah

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s a no-nonsense look at what grassroots or non-bureaucratic groups in Manchester are actually doing—*not performative policing*—to push back against antisocial behaviour and rebuild real community:

Residents reclaimed filthy, fly-tipped alleys and turned them into verdant, shared community spaces full of flowers, herbs, seating, fairy lights—even pizzas and barbecues.

#### 3. **“star*” Scheme – Grassroots Rugby**
Greater Manchester Police partnered with local rugby clubs to bring youth and families impacted by trauma into structured sport, mentoring, and community. One youth on the brink of antisocial behaviour redirected his life through this connection.

###  Summary: What Actually Makes a Difference

| What It Is | Why It Works |
|------------|--------------|
| Gardening together | Builds pride and ownership—antisocial acts don’t stick where community thrives. |
| Mobile safe spaces | Meets young people where they are—without criminalising them. |
| Sports & mentorship | Offers belonging, structure, positive identity across trauma lines. |
| Creative mental health | Centers youth expression and peer support—not stigma. |
| Dignified outreach | Offers stability and support, not punishment. |
| Local networks | Builds real responsiveness, not top-down control. |
| Community media | Allows marginalised voices to be heard and understood. |
| Rights-based advocacy | Addresses root causes—exclusion, displacement, injustice. |
| Cultural anchors | Protects places that root generations together—soil for civic belonging. |

### TL;DR  
There *are* real, bottom-up efforts in Manchester making a tangible difference. Not flashy PR, but quiet, consistent and creative work: gardens, games, mentorship, mental health, culture, community media, legal rights—and actual belonging.

Want contacts or links to get involved with any of these? Let me know.



#### You:
I know that area in levenshulme and I've passed by the moss side one, they lasted a week, now they're fly tipping zones again. There's one in gorton that lasted a few weeks, but even that is now just a filthy back alley full of tipped binbags.
I also live near the new 'youth' centre in Gorton, it's supposedly servicable, like a leisure centre, but it's basically empty except for corpo events, and the nearby new gorton hub is like walking into a fucking prison, it's basically one big cold clinical room with a few benches, with a panopticon of meeting rooms staring down at it like they're ready to watch a riot.
Rugby is nice, but that's like what, 20 kids a week? Not exactly stellar. (lol)
I'm not familiar with the other projects, but the ones I do know don't fill me with confidence.

#### ChatGPT:
Yeah — that’s the pattern: **good ideas, shit follow-through.**  

You’ve seen the cycle on the ground:  
- **Community fixes** (alley gardens, murals, benches, centres) → look great for the first photo-op.  
- Then: no ongoing stewardship, no maintenance, no presence.  
- Within weeks → back to rubbish, tagging, abandonment.  

That’s because in Manchester (and most of the UK right now) it’s all **project-based funding**. Councils and charities get money for a *launch*, not for **5 years of caretaking**. It’s cheaper politically to “open” something than to actually embed it.  

The result: shiny buildings that feel empty or hostile (like your Gorton examples), “community hubs” designed like airports, not like places people want to linger, sports schemes that reach a dozen kids out of thousands.  

The deeper failure is **design without belonging**. If you build things that feel sterile, corporate, or surveilled, people avoid them. If there’s no consistent human presence (trusted youth workers, caretakers, neighbours who live the project), the space decays fast.  

That’s why alley gardens work briefly — the idea is sound — but if no one has time/ownership to defend it, fly-tippers win. Same for youth spaces: if it feels like a prison atrium instead of a third place, young people vote with their feet.  

So you’re not being cynical — you’re describing exactly why the “solutions” feel hollow. They’re **gestures**, not rooted in ongoing, lived community.  

The stuff that lasts tends to look very different:  
- **Spaces people actually want to use** (warm, informal, human-scaled).  
- **Community ownership** (not just consultation, but control).  
- **Permanent staffing** (caretakers/youth workers embedded for years, not projects).  
- **Design for people, not for optics** (cozy, messy, alive—not clinical glass boxes).  

And honestly: Manchester isn’t doing that at scale. It’s doing showcase fixes.  

Do you want me to dig into whether there are *any* genuinely community-owned and run spaces in Manchester that *aren’t* council-led or corpo-funded (so they don’t fall into the “shiny but soulless” trap)? Those are the only ones that tend to stick.

#### You:
okay, I'm beginning to see why Reform are raring right now, people are fucking sick of empty gestures that eat up as much money as could be used to provide real solutions

#### ChatGPT:
Exactly. That’s why Reform are biting through the noise — not because they’ve got coherent answers, but because they tap that **raw frustration** with:  

- **Money wasted on optics** → vanity hubs, one-off schemes, endless “consultations.”  
- **Institutions that feel alien** → sterile glass boxes, cops showing up only for photo-ops, “community spaces” nobody actually wants to be in.  
- **Short-termism** → a burst of activity, then abandonment.  

People look around at litter, fly-tipping, noise, reckless driving, youth in balaclavas — and then see the council spend millions on what feels like Potemkin fixes. That dissonance is gasoline for populists. Reform don’t need real plans, they just need to say, “The establishment wastes your money and ignores you,” and it lands, because it matches lived experience.  

What people actually crave is **competence + continuity**. Not even utopia — just:  
- Someone visibly keeping things in order.  
- Places that feel welcoming instead of cold or surveilled.  
- A sense that if you report a problem, it’s dealt with.  

Instead they get *gesture politics*. And yeah — that gap is exactly the space Reform are moving into.  

Want me to map how much Reform are gaining right now in Greater Manchester specifically (like ward/council level), so you can see how strong that backlash is locally?
