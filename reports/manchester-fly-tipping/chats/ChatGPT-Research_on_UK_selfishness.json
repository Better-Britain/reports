It’s easy to see why one might feel this way. In my own Manchester neighborhood, I’ve dealt with **“dickheads” chucking rubbish over my garden fence**. Local and national leaders echo this sentiment with talk of *personal responsibility* and harsher punishments for litterbugs. Before I confidently declare “actually everybody is lovely and it’s just the council’s fault,” I wanted to **test my original claim**: *Have people in Britain really become more selfish or less civic-minded in recent years?* \n\nTo find out, I dug into studies, surveys, and reports on Britons’ social attitudes – especially changes during the pandemic and under the Conservative government since 2010. Here’s what the evidence shows.\n\n## Declining Civic Engagement and Community Spirit \n\n**Long-term trends suggest a worrying decline in community participation.** Multiple studies have documented a broad **erosion of social “fabric”** in the UK over the last few decades. For example, a 2020 report by the think tank Onward found that Britons are **far less engaged in community life than even ten years ago**. People today are **less likely to be members of local groups or clubs, to volunteer, or to attend community activities** than they were in the early 2010s【3†L71-L79】. Likewise, Britons have become **less generous with charitable giving** – donating a smaller share of their income to charity than they did a decade ago【3†L74-L79】【3†L145-L153】. \n\nOther hard data back up this decline in civic-minded behavior. The government’s Community Life Survey shows that **formal volunteering rates have dropped significantly in the past decade**. In 2013/14 about 27% of English adults volunteered at least once a month, but by 2023/24 that had fallen to just 16%【19†L149-L157】. The biggest dip came during the COVID-19 pandemic – monthly volunteer participation plunged from 23% in 2019/20 to 17% in 2020/21【19†L149-L157】. Even as life returned to normal, **volunteering hasn’t bounced back**: the 2023/24 participation rate was the **lowest recorded** since that survey began【19†L149-L157】. \n\nIt’s not just volunteering. **Membership in community organizations has been dwindling for years.** Fewer than half of Britons now belong to any local group, and attendance at communal events (from church services to hobby clubs) is way down compared to the 1990s【3†L133-L141】. Traditional neighborhood institutions have withered – Britain has lost thousands of local pubs and post offices in the past 20 years【3†L149-L157】 – eroding the venues where civic bonds often form. And while the number of registered charities keeps rising, **individual generosity has declined**: a decade ago Britons gave £1 in charity for every £100 they earned, but today they give only about 73p【3†L145-L153】. \n\n**Trust and neighborliness have frayed as well.** According to the Office for National Statistics, **fewer people now feel that their neighbors can be trusted or would be willing to help each other out**. In fact, the share of people who believe their local residents are willing to help their neighbors has fallen by about 7 percentage points since the mid-2010s【8†L211-L218】. These trends all paint a picture of a society that is **less tightly knit than it used to be**, with weaker social ties and declining participation in the civic life of the community.\n\n## The Pandemic’s Impact on Attitudes and Behavior\n\nIt’s impossible to examine recent selfishness without considering **COVID-19’s disruptive effect**. The pandemic was a double-edged sword for community spirit: it brought out both the best and worst in people. \n\n**Early in the crisis, we actually saw inspiring social solidarity.** Remember the spring of 2020, when neighbors organized **mutual aid groups** to deliver groceries to the vulnerable, and millions **clapped on their doorsteps** weekly for NHS heroes? Many of us felt a renewed *“we’re all in this together”* camaraderie. Surveys confirm this: the first lockdown sparked “**many inspiring examples of mutual aid, kindness and unity** in the face of an existential threat,” as one social cohesion study noted【20†L17-L26】. During those early months, **community spirit was at a high**, and informal helping (like checking on isolated neighbors) actually *increased*, especially in close-knit areas【8†L199-L207】.\n\nHowever, **as the pandemic dragged on, that unity faded and fractures re-emerged.** By late 2020 and 2021, the initial burst of togetherness had given way to fatigue and frustration. A report that tracked social cohesion through the first 18 months of COVID observed that **“as the initial period of community spirit and unity subsided, some old divisions and tensions… re-emerged”【20†L23-L31】**. People grew weary of restrictions and began to chafe against each other. Public discourse turned to identifying *“covidiots”* who didn’t follow rules, and compliance frayed over time. \n\nIn fact, **many Britons felt their fellow citizens were acting selfishly during the pandemic.** A study by King’s College London found that **49% of UK adults believe young people were “selfish” in how they behaved** in the crisis (ignoring lockdown rules because COVID was seen as low-risk for them), compared to only 31% who felt young people were mostly selfless and public-spirited【1†L176-L184】. Strikingly, even **young people judged their own age group harshly** – nearly half of Gen Z respondents said people their age had been selfish during COVID【1†L180-L184】. This perception of widespread rule-breaking and *“looking out for number one”* undoubtedly fueled the idea that Britain had become a more selfish society.\n\n**Visible antisocial behaviors spiked during this period as well.** A glaring example was **fly tipping** – exactly the issue that got me so riled up. With civic amenities disrupted, illegal dumping of waste **surged by 16% in England during 2020-21** (1.13 million fly-tipping incidents, up from 980,000 the year before)【17†L167-L174】. The reasons were partly practical (closed recycling centers and reduced bin collections【17†L203-L211】), but the outcome was that many communities *looked* much messier and more disrespected. To a frustrated resident, it sure felt like nobody cared about anyone else’s property or the local environment. Stories of rule-flouting parties (“**Partygate**”), panic buying, and general disregard for others’ well-being during lockdowns further cemented the impression that *selfishness was on the rise*.\n\nBy the time pandemic restrictions lifted, a lot of us sensed a **shift in everyday interactions – and not for the better**. One commentator lamented that the *“in it together”* spirit had become *“a distant memory,”* replaced by “a new sense of selfishness” in society【11†L231-L239】. She noted more strangers **cutting each other off in traffic**, more **infighting even among once-close friends**, and an atmosphere of “collective social burnout” making people quicker to anger【11†L231-L239】. In her words, *“the selfishness of people… now feels starker and more visible than ever”* and **“as a society, we have become more selfish in a post-Covid world”**【11†L287-L294】. This anecdotal view resonates with many of us – after all the trauma and stress, people seem a bit less patient, less kind, and more prone to *“looking out for themselves”* nowadays.\n\n## Public Perceptions: A Less Kind, More Self-Oriented Britain?\n\nIf you ask the British public about the state of our collective kindness, you’ll hear a lot of pessimism. **Most Britons *themselves*** believe that social compassion has deteriorated. In a 2024 national poll, a whopping **78% of people said that society has become less kind than it used to be**【27†L81-L89】. In other words, nearly 8 in 10 Brits feel we’re living through a decline in everyday kindness and consideration. Many specifically blame the toxic tone of online discourse – about 70% in that survey felt **social media has played a significant role in making people less civil and kind** to each other【27†L81-L89】. (It’s hard to disagree when a quick scroll through Twitter reveals constant trolling and snark.) \n\nThis sense of a *“meaner”* society isn’t just about internet culture. It ties into a broader narrative of the UK becoming more atomized and *“every person for themselves.”* The phrase **“Broken Britain”** has been thrown around for years, usually to describe crime or social ills, but lately it feels applicable to our **fraying social bonds** as well. In July 2025, a large-scale study by More in Common described Britain as feeling **“shattered”** by years of crisis – with people exhausted, distrustful of institutions, and withdrawing inwards【25†L57-L66】【25†L121-L129】. When asked to diagnose what’s wrong, people don’t just point to one political party or policy; many feel there’s a **deeper breakdown in the social contract**. This **“malaise”** includes a collapse of trust in leaders (87% have little to no trust in politicians【25†L122-L130】, whom they see as self-serving), but also a loss of faith that *“we’re all playing on the same team”* as citizens. \n\nNotably, **economic struggles and constant crises can breed self-preservationist attitudes.** After enduring a pandemic, a cost-of-living crisis, and political chaos, many Brits are simply **in survival mode**. As one writer put it, *“we have replaced one life-threatening event, the pandemic, with another – the terrifying reality of a cost of living crisis”*【11†L247-L255】. When you’re worried about how to pay the next energy bill or feed your children, it’s hard to muster community spirit. Research shows stress is a major driver of incivility and selfish behavior in general【14†L35-L38】. So it’s unsurprising that **public mood has soured** and people might appear less courteous or altruistic – not necessarily out of malice, but out of anxiety and fatigue. In surveys this year, **43% of Britons said money woes are their biggest source of stress** and a majority feel they’re “surviving, not living”【25†L139-L147】. When folks are *that* worn down, their **bandwidth for empathy shrinks**; looking after oneself (and one’s immediate family) understandably takes priority.\n\n## Are Britons Really Selfish – or Just Struggling? (The Nuance)\n\nSo far, the findings sound grim: declining volunteering, weaker community links, more perceived rudeness, and a public convinced that kindness is eroding. Does this mean Brits have indeed become an uncaring, selfish lot in recent times? **The full picture is more nuanced.** Alongside the negative trends, there are **some heartening indicators and enduring values** that suggest Britons haven’t completely turned into *“Covidian selfish monsters.”* \n\nFirst, while trust in institutions is abysmal, **trust in each other at a personal level remains relatively high** – and has even improved. International surveys find the UK among the **most trusting populations globally** when it comes to interpersonal trust【5†L149-L158】. As of 2022, **46% of Britons agree that “most people can be trusted,”** a significant rise from the late 1990s when barely 29% felt that way【5†L159-L168】. In fact, Britain now ranks near the top in the world on this measure of social trust【5†L149-L158】. This suggests that *on an individual level*, many of us **still instinctively expect goodwill and fairness from others**, rather than assuming everyone is out for themselves. High trust societies tend to have more cooperation and altruism, so this is a positive sign that *beneath the grumpiness, Brits do have some faith in each other*.\n\nMoreover, Brits continue to value **collective responsibility and helping the less fortunate**, at least in principle. Public attitudes have not wholesale shifted to a rugged “you’re on your own” ideology. For example, even after decades of neoliberal policy, **a majority of Britons still favor state support for those in need** rather than a purely individualist approach. In one poll (albeit from 2013, reflecting on the Thatcher legacy), 52% of Britons agreed it *“is the government’s responsibility to redistribute income”* to reduce inequality, and a whopping 78% said *“the government should ensure equal opportunities”* for all【10†L115-L123】. In other words, **most people still believe in fairness, solidarity, and a social safety net** – hardly the mindset of an every-person-for-themselves society. And this sentiment has likely persisted through the pandemic: a 2020 King’s College survey found **55% of Britons felt the COVID crisis made government action to reduce income gaps *more* necessary**【24†L29-L32】. Far from turning more selfish, many people actually wanted *more* collective action to help others during tough times.\n\nWe also saw **incredible altruism during specific moments of crisis**, which points to underlying social kindness that can reignite when needed. Think of the public’s response to the war in Ukraine – Britons donated millions of pounds and even **opened their homes to refugees** in significant numbers. During COVID, while some hoarded toilet paper, others were **volunteering in droves** for NHS responder programs or delivering food parcels. It’s telling that informal, neighbourly volunteering **increased** in 2020【8†L201-L205】 even as formal volunteering was curtailed – meaning people found ad-hoc ways to help each other when official channels were shut. These acts suggest that **British society’s “moral core” isn’t dead**; when a clear need arises, a lot of ordinary people *do step up to care for others*. \n\nFinally, it’s important to recognize the role of **policies and systemic factors** in creating some of the selfish outcomes we see. My initial gripe was about fly tipping in Manchester – and indeed, the data showed a jump in fly-tipping incidents during the pandemic【17†L167-L174】. But context matters. That rise was not simply because *individual Brits suddenly became lazier or meaner* in 2020; it was also driven by **council decisions (closing tips, shortening landfill hours, introducing confusing booking systems) and resource cuts** that made proper waste disposal harder【17†L203-L211】. When regular folks face more friction or cost to do the right thing, some percentage will choose the selfish shortcut. The same goes for other behaviors: road rage gets worse when infrastructure is poor and roads are congested; civility declines when customer service workers are stretched thin and tempers flare in long queues. In short, **selfish behavior often increases under stress, scarcity, or poor governance – not necessarily from a sudden moral failure of the populace.** \n\n## Conclusion: Selfish Society or Something Else?\n\nStepping back, what’s the verdict? **Has Britain become more selfish and less civic-minded?** The evidence suggests that **certainly, observable civic engagement has declined** – fewer people are joining, volunteering, or giving back to the community than a decade ago, and many **Britons *feel*** that kindness and respect have dwindled. The turmoil of the pandemic and years of austerity and crisis under Tory rule have left people **exhausted and more focused on their own survival**, which can manifest as seeming selfishness. It’s no wonder I and others have perceived a rise in *“I’m alright, Jack”* attitudes.\n\nHowever, saying *“everyone’s selfish now”* is **too simplistic**. Many underlying attitudes of **trust, fairness, and solidarity persist among the British public**. We still see flashes of *community spirit* – from mutual aid groups to charitable giving in crises – that reveal a capacity for collective goodness when circumstances allow. If anything, what has changed is not some innate national character, but the **conditions people are living under**. Years of cuts to social infrastructure, divisive politics, economic precarity, and pandemic disruptions have **strained Britain’s social fabric**, making it harder for people to engage communally or act on their better angels consistently. \n\nIn my case, I was ready to blame **individual “dickheads” for fly tipping** – but I’ve come to realize that *systemic issues* (like council waste policies and closures) played a huge role in that problem. Likewise, before declaring that Britons have lost their civic soul, we should consider how **better conditions and leadership might bring out a revival of community-minded behavior**. After all, the same Brits who seem indifferent today were the ones clapping for neighbors and volunteering en masse just a couple of years ago.\n\n**Bottom line:** There *is* some truth to the idea that civic-mindedness has eroded in recent times, especially post-pandemic, but it’s not because British people have simply become “selfish” by nature. It’s because of a perfect storm of social, economic, and policy pressures that have frayed our connections. Change those conditions – make it easier for people to do the right thing, give them hope that their contributions matter, and relieve some of the daily stresses – and we just might find that the **better angels of British nature** were merely dormant, not dead. In the meantime, I’ll keep advocating for sensible local policies (and maybe invest in a higher garden fence) rather than writing off my fellow Mancunians as irredeemable selfish gits. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Onward Think Tank – *“The State of our Social Fabric”* (2020)【3†L71-L79】【3†L145-L153】  \n- Community Life Survey, UK Department for Culture – Volunteering stats (2013–2024)【19†L149-L157】  \n- Office for National Statistics – *Social capital during COVID-19* (2020/21)【8†L211-L218】【8†L199-L207】  \n- King’s College London Policy Institute – *“Covid Cohorts” study* (2021)【1†L176-L184】  \n- The Guardian – *“Fly-tipping in England increases during Covid”* (Dec 2021)【17†L167-L174】【17†L203-L211】  \n- The Independent – *“Have we become more selfish in a post-Covid world?”* (Sept 2022)【11†L231-L239】【11†L287-L294】  \n- Tea India/Obsurvant poll – Kindness in society survey (Oct 2024)【27†L81-L89】  \n- More in Common – *“Shattered Britain” report* (July 2025)【25†L57-L66】【25†L122-L130】  \n- King’s College London/World Values Survey – Trust in others (2023)【5†L159-L168】【5†L149-L158】  \n- YouGov-Cambridge Poll – attitudes on state vs individual (2013)【10†L115-L123】"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":1515,"end_ix":1526,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"The State of our Social Fabric | Onward","url":"https://ukonward.com/reports/the-state-of-our-social-fabric/#:~:text=The%20UK%20has%20suffered%20a,the%20social%20fabric%20of%20communities","text":"The UK has suffered a long-term and broad-based decline in the networks and institutions that make up the social fabric of communities","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":3,"cited_message_id":"1149c616-ff18-4dcc-8337-ed49579723d0","search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"","start_line_num":71,"end_line_num":79,"connector_source":null},"og_tags":null}},{"start_ix":1679,"end_ix":1690,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"The State of our Social Fabric | Onward","url":"https://ukonward.com/reports/the-state-of-our-social-fabric/#:~:text=People%20are%20less%20likely%20to,of%20debt%2C%20or%20hold%20a","text":"People are less likely to be a member of a local group or volunteer, to attend church or community activities, or go on trips with their families than they were even ten years ago.

Let's address issues one by one, and see where we get to. \n\nLess charity makes sense, people are poorer, though, right?

This is easier to believe if we can find a higher proportion of negative news stories, local, regional and national at the very least, that demonise or otherwise 'other' people (even genuinely 'bad' people). A fall of 7% is significant, but it's not exactly massive, and could easily be from different reasons than claimed.\n\nSpontaneous 'Mutual aid' groups were very much a fleeting instance, mostly directly in the lockdown and was partially driven not by a need to help, but both by a simple understanding (empathy) that older or vulnerable people were more at risk, but also by subconscious self-interest (the fewer people out on the streets, the better for everyone)\n\nThe clapping thing was just a fucking gimmick, something for the smoother brained people to 'do' with their evening that wasn't having an argument with their partner or kids. Like a brainwashing exercise. I've literally never met anyone who actually stood out and clapped on their doorstep, so I'm pretty sure it was only in particularly stepfordian neighbourhoods, perhaps those where journalists live, relatively 'nice' areas. Clapping for the nhs was not a wellbeing issue, it was a collective delusion and social compliance engine, like well I'm compliant on staying home, I might as well be compliant on clapping into the night to show off to my neighbours how much I care. This story isn't the same for every single person involved, but for the vast majority I'd argue it is, and you seem to have digested only content that bought into that line, because real people don't write the nonsense down.\n\nThe later pandemic was definitely an era of griefing. I myself hated wearing a mask, but I did it when I had to, and suffered through 18 months of toothache and bad breath because I couldn't book a dentist. That was a dark 2 years for me and many others, but it didn't make me hate people... it made me hate the Tories who were taking the piss and throwing parties because their Granddad hadn't been the ones who died alone in barely functioning hospitals. Online hate was rampant, especially on twitter, where reactions were common with every single new piece of news in the news cycle, because everyone was home (often alone), and many had literally nothing else to do. I would however argue they didn't hate people more, but they did forget to engage their empathy because they didn't use it for 23.9hrs a day, for months at a time (some for years).\n\nI'd like to know more about the KCL study. Who was polled and what were the questions, because while I'm not surprised a report could legit reach those findings, framing it as old believing the young were selfish seems unusual, when the reverse was almost certainly true too. Again though, believing a thing doesn't necessarily make it true.\n\nOnly a rise of what, 15%? additional fly tipping is actually less than I thought, but maybe the corresponding dip in council funding (and other minor changes increasing friction) made that inevitable, especially cos a lot of people during (and in the couple of years after) the pandemic had extra cash and spent more time at home, so spent more time buying new things (mainly online), putting some effort into DIY, buying a new mattress because those new material mattress services were still going strong (or at least hadn't tailed off yet). Spend all time looking at your stuff, and not spending your money going out, and of course you're going to end up buying a new TV or a fridge (I myself bought a 63\" tv in nov/december 2020 cos it was a good deal and I figured I deserved it).\n\nPanic buying was a blip. It definitely affected the rage cycle, and even my nan complained about 'some dickheads buying up all the toilet paper', but she never ran out, and by 2021 had forgotten it even happened when she recalled to me \"oh yeah, that was a funny time\" (funny as in weird, not hahah funny). I don't think it soured her (or most others) on _all_ people.\n\nPartygate was definitely a major stoker, though I think most regular people expected that anyway. They weren't as angry about partygate as the MPs who used it to take down Boris and his mates claimed they were. People were angry about 32 billion pounds in profiteering, but the papers never really had much to say about that (I have an entire chain of info about how establishment papers never really followed that money to a satisfying conclusion, and post-2024 victory, Labour have barely touched that trail either (despite saying they would). I think there's a commitee about it, but would have to check to be sure)\n\nI've definitely noticed careless driving first hand. A lack of signalling (I can walk to the supermarket, crossing 3-4 roads, and at perhaps one junction per journey, there's someone who amber-gambles or accelerates while someone is crossing, not as a threat, just to hurry), or failing to enable their turn signal, or leaving on their hazards and driving on the right, when the left lane is clear (UK). I'd like to find a good reason for this, and I'm some contributor is just people working more, worrying more, not having their mind on the road because they're in a hurry to get shit done. This counts as civic disregard, but we need to be able to measure it. Who is more likely to be found careless/reckless driving, where, when, what reasons are given when requesting tickets be overturned, did the quality of driving schools drop in the pandemic if it's mainly new drivers, or are the changes to car dashboards (touch screens and weird new digital layouts) causing people to have more trouble finding signals? Have their been more roadworks, that might encourage a belief that the road condition is worse, or do other drivers have a belief cycle that's driving them to notice self-entitled drivers more... There could be a lot of reasons for this.\n\nI'm skipping ahead cos you repeat some parts here.\nYour 'survival mode' theory makes some sense (as I kinda said above), but this comes from an opinion piece. Not to mention the independent as a source used to be more reliable, but that doesn't really provide proof that people became dickheads, only that a journalist/columnist believes it. The study that says people feel they're \"surviving, not living\" shows the system not working for them (unless of course we can say for sure they were actually doing fine, which is true until 2022 for most middle and upper-middle, non-essential workers, who mostly got to stay home and work from the garden or the den and put money in their pension or holiday pot). Who believes that and how were they asked about it?\n\nYour kcl study about trust seems to contradict the earlier kcl study about trust (49 and 46 believing opposite things, but both being used as a case for the thing they believe), that needs more context to be useful.\n\nYour \"Brits continue to value collective responsibility and helping the less fortunate\" claim needs citation. I beleive you when you say \"a majority of Britons still favor state support for those in need\", but it also needs citation. The leftfootforward results are positive, but pretty biased, so I'd want to know more about the methodology there. It could be entirely true or it could be wishful thinking and leading questions. \n\nThe support for Ukrainian refugees was pretty good in the short term, but the press ran a LOT of stories the instant any of them fell out with their hosts, or exposed complex needs that could not be met. Likewise the 'asylum hotel' issues we face today are more about opportunist populist politicians (mainly farage and his supporters, but also the tories scoring points) using them as a wedge. People want to help others, but even the non-outed-racist 'regular' folks, jump straight to \"we should help our own first\" without taking a moment to consider that when it comes to helping the poor, investments in support systems for immigrants are often the same support systems that help the poorest or most in need natives. It's lazy, and the outcome is angry white men shouting at hotels, while the hotel owners get paid and send the money to their bank accounts in the caymans (or you  know, the city of london for magic growth).\n\nOn policies and systemic factors, I kinda believe this is the primary cause of most of these problems, bad decisions, under funding, hostile systems, and staff on the ground without enough power to solve the problems, because the leadership set metrics and workflows and processes that prevent them from doing anything more than their 'jobsworth', even if they wanted to and weren't burnt out to fuck for not being able to help any of the desperate people forced to prostrate themselves before them for 70 quid a week. \"When regular folks face more friction or cost to do the right thing, some percentage will choose the selfish shortcut.\" is the key point. If you don't have enough runway, you can't get up the speed to take off. Good governance is about providing more than just the bare minimum, like if you want your country to build businesses, you need to give people time and money to take risks. They can't do that on £1.13 for delivering a burger across town, when the platform gets £12.50 and a service fee, potentially more than the restaurant that made the burger (I suppose I'm exaggerating a little, but not much).\n\nYou've kinda written the post I wanted, but your evidence doesn't really support the case you wrote.\n\nDon't write a blog post, just get me the facts you can... Are people actually more selfish, or are they just believing that everyone else is more selfish because all their systems make everything about personal responsibility because it's way way cheaper than fixing the broken systems?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"caterpillar_selected_sources":["web"],"selected_mcp_sources":[],"selected_sources":["web"],"selected_github_repos":[],"system_hints":["research"],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9752eaf0eb68bef6-LHR","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0a63a35c-c06e-4ec9-b772-b991b4a0b777","children":["2ea937f8-68d4-4099-9d81-31396b275272"]},"2ea937f8-68d4-4099-9d81-31396b275272":{"id":"2ea937f8-68d4-4099-9d81-31396b275272","message":{"id":"2ea937f8-68d4-4099-9d81-31396b275272","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756206997.239445,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Got it.

I've literally never met anyone who actually stood out and clapped on their doorstep, so I'm pretty sure it was only in particularly stepfordian neighbourhoods, perhaps those where journalists live, relatively 'nice' areas. Clapping for the nhs was not a wellbeing issue, it was a collective delusion and social compliance engine, like well I'm compliant on staying home, I might as well be compliant on clapping into the night to show off to my neighbours how much I care. This story isn't the same for every single person involved, but for the vast majority I'd argue it is, and you seem to have digested only content that bought into that line, because real people don't write the nonsense down.\n\nThe later pandemic was definitely an era of griefing. I myself hated wearing a mask, but I did it when I had to, and suffered through 18 months of toothache and bad breath because I couldn't book a dentist. That was a dark 2 years for me and many others, but it didn't make me hate people... it made me hate the Tories who were taking the piss and throwing parties because their Granddad hadn't been the ones who died alone in barely functioning hospitals. Online hate was rampant, especially on twitter, where reactions were common with every single new piece of news in the news cycle, because everyone was home (often alone), and many had literally nothing else to do. I would however argue they didn't hate people more, but they did forget to engage their empathy because they didn't use it for 23.9hrs a day, for months at a time (some for years).\n\nI'd like to know more about the KCL study. Who was polled and what were the questions, because while I'm not surprised a report could legit reach those findings, framing it as old believing the young were selfish seems unusual, when the reverse was almost certainly true too. Again though, believing a thing doesn't necessarily make it true.\n\nOnly a rise of what, 15%? additional fly tipping is actually less than I thought, but maybe the corresponding dip in council funding (and other minor changes increasing friction) made that inevitable, especially cos a lot of people during (and in the couple of years after) the pandemic had extra cash and spent more time at home, so spent more time buying new things (mainly online), putting some effort into DIY, buying a new mattress because those new material mattress services were still going strong (or at least hadn't tailed off yet). Spend all time looking at your stuff, and not spending your money going out, and of course you're going to end up buying a new TV or a fridge (I myself bought a 63\" tv in nov/december 2020 cos it was a good deal and I figured I deserved it).\n\nPanic buying was a blip. It definitely affected the rage cycle, and even my nan complained about 'some dickheads buying up all the toilet paper', but she never ran out, and by 2021 had forgotten it even happened when she recalled to me \"oh yeah, that was a funny time\" (funny as in weird, not hahah funny). I don't think it soured her (or most others) on _all_ people.\n\nPartygate was definitely a major stoker, though I think most regular people expected that anyway. They weren't as angry about partygate as the MPs who used it to take down Boris and his mates claimed they were. People were angry about 32 billion pounds in profiteering, but the papers never really had much to say about that (I have an entire chain of info about how establishment papers never really followed that money to a satisfying conclusion, and post-2024 victory, Labour have barely touched that trail either (despite saying they would). I think there's a commitee about it, but would have to check to be sure)\n\nI've definitely noticed careless driving first hand. A lack of signalling (I can walk to the supermarket, crossing 3-4 roads, and at perhaps one junction per journey, there's someone who amber-gambles or accelerates while someone is crossing, not as a threat, just to hurry), or failing to enable their turn signal, or leaving on their hazards and driving on the right, when the left lane is clear (UK). I'd like to find a good reason for this, and I'm some contributor is just people working more, worrying more, not having their mind on the road because they're in a hurry to get shit done. This counts as civic disregard, but we need to be able to measure it. Who is more likely to be found careless/reckless driving, where, when, what reasons are given when requesting tickets be overturned, did the quality of driving schools drop in the pandemic if it's mainly new drivers, or are the changes to car dashboards (touch screens and weird new digital layouts) causing people to have more trouble finding signals? Have their been more roadworks, that might encourage a belief that the road condition is worse, or do other drivers have a belief cycle that's driving them to notice self-entitled drivers more... There could be a lot of reasons for this.\n\nI'm skipping ahead cos you repeat some parts here.\nYour 'survival mode' theory makes some sense (as I kinda said above), but this comes from an opinion piece. Not to mention the independent as a source used to be more reliable, but that doesn't really provide proof that people became dickheads, only that a journalist/columnist believes it. The study that says people feel they're \"surviving, not living\" shows the system not working for them (unless of course we can say for sure they were actually doing fine, which is true until 2022 for most middle and upper-middle, non-essential workers, who mostly got to stay home and work from the garden or the den and put money in their pension or holiday pot). Who believes that and how were they asked about it?\n\nYour kcl study about trust seems to contradict the earlier kcl study about trust (49 and 46 believing opposite things, but both being used as a case for the thing they believe), that needs more context to be useful.\n\nYour \"Brits continue to value collective responsibility and helping the less fortunate\" claim needs citation. I beleive you when you say \"a majority of Britons still favor state support for those in need\", but it also needs citation. The leftfootforward results are positive, but pretty biased, so I'd want to know more about the methodology there. It could be entirely true or it could be wishful thinking and leading questions. \n\nThe support for Ukrainian refugees was pretty good in the short term, but the press ran a LOT of stories the instant any of them fell out with their hosts, or exposed complex needs that could not be met. Likewise the 'asylum hotel' issues we face today are more about opportunist populist politicians (mainly farage and his supporters, but also the tories scoring points) using them as a wedge. People want to help others, but even the non-outed-racist 'regular' folks, jump straight to \"we should help our own first\" without taking a moment to consider that when it comes to helping the poor, investments in support systems for immigrants are often the same support systems that help the poorest or most in need natives. It's lazy, and the outcome is angry white men shouting at hotels, while the hotel owners get paid and send the money to their bank accounts in the caymans (or you  know, the city of london for magic growth).\n\nOn policies and systemic factors, I kinda believe this is the primary cause of most of these problems, bad decisions, under funding, hostile systems, and staff on the ground without enough power to solve the problems, because the leadership set metrics and workflows and processes that prevent them from doing anything more than their 'jobsworth', even if they wanted to and weren't burnt out to fuck for not being able to help any of the desperate people forced to prostrate themselves before them for 70 quid a week. \"When regular folks face more friction or cost to do the right thing, some percentage will choose the selfish shortcut.\" is the key point. If you don't have enough runway, you can't get up the speed to take off. Good governance is about providing more than just the bare minimum, like if you want your country to build businesses, you need to give people time and money to take risks. They can't do that on £1.13 for delivering a burger across town, when the platform gets £12.50 and a service fee, potentially more than the restaurant that made the burger (I suppose I'm exaggerating a little, but not much).\n\nYou've kinda written the post I wanted, but your evidence doesn't really support the case you wrote.\n\nDon't write a blog post, just get me the facts you can... Are people actually more selfish, or are they just believing that everyone else is more selfish because all their systems make everything about personal responsibility because it's way way cheaper than fixing the broken systems?\n\nhmm, I suppose that's 5 entirely different queries. I think you can do your best to do all 5. Since you're not writing a blog post, just find the sources, and report what facts you can find. We'll put it together from them.","async_task_type":"research","async_task_status_messages":{"initial":"Evidence Review on UK Civic Behavior, Social Attitudes, and Systemic Influences","completed_with_time":"Research completed in 8m","completed_no_time":"Completed research","completed":"Researched for ","error":"Research failed","cancelled":"Research cancelled"},"b1de6e2_s":true,"command":"start_research_task","request_id":"9752ed321954bef6-LHR","message_type":"next","model_slug":"research","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"b913ceff-00ec-4366-9157-99dd6d95a7a5","timestamp_":"absolute","async_task_id":"deepresch_68ad97f6622881919f196b4c08e169d8","async_task_conversation_id":"68ad97f6-64c0-8326-b2d2-2596ef9c9762","async_task_created_at":"2025-08-26 11:18:15.590999+00:00","deep_research_version":"full"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b913ceff-00ec-4366-9157-99dd6d95a7a5","children":["b01668df-5abf-4804-9d17-b762e75ee950"]},"b01668df-5abf-4804-9d17-b762e75ee950":{"id":"b01668df-5abf-4804-9d17-b762e75ee950","message":{"id":"b01668df-5abf-4804-9d17-b762e75ee950","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756207551.212679,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["# Are Britons Really More Selfish, or Just Struggling? \n\n## Declining Charity & Volunteering: Cost-of-Living Squeeze  \nIt’s true that Britons have been giving less money and time lately – but a big reason is the **cost-of-living crisis**, not a sudden collapse of generosity. Over 2021–2023, UK consumer prices jumped about **21% in total**【58†L89-L97】, while wages only rose ~4% annually (barely keeping up)【59†L125-L134】【59†L143-L150】. This inflation surge (the highest in 40+ years) meant **household budgets were gutted** – by mid-2022 many families had essentially “no disposable income” left after essentials【59†L147-L155】. In practical terms, a £20 charity donation in 2021 would only be worth about **£17.60 by 2024** due to rising prices【59†L181-L189】, and people simply had less spare cash to donate. It’s no surprise, then, that **1.6 million fewer people donated to charity in 2021 than in 2020**, a drop dubbed the “cost of giving crisis”【59†L172-L179】. Surveys in early 2023 found 60% of Britons felt it had become *harder to give* to charity compared to six months prior【56†L27-L31】. In short, folks are tightening belts – **not because they care less, but because they have less**. \n\nVolunteering has also dipped, likely for similar reasons. After a burst of community spirit during the 2020 lockdowns, **volunteering rates fell back** once life resumed. In 2021–22, only **34% of people volunteered at least monthly**, about a 6% drop from the height of 2020–21【61†L33-L36】. Even informal neighborly help declined – **46% helped out at least once in 2021/22, down from 54% during the pandemic** (the lowest rate on record)【61†L13-L20】. This doesn’t mean Britons suddenly became uncaring “dickheads”; it means many are **exhausted and overworked**. Juggling multiple jobs or gig work to cover **rent that doubled and energy bills that soared** leaves little time or energy for volunteering. People aren’t giving less out of selfishness – they’re **in survival mode**, struggling just to keep a roof over their heads. \n\n## Community Engagement and Trust: Perception vs Reality  \nLower participation in *local* community activities isn’t proof that everyone became antisocial – it partly reflects how community has moved **online**. Many people (especially younger ones) find their sense of community via phones, laptops, gaming and social media rather than the local pub or Women’s Institute. So if fewer attend village meetings or know the neighbors, it’s not necessarily nastiness – they’re simply engaging in **different communities** (global online ones) instead of geographic ones. \n\nWhat about **trusting neighbors**? There was an ONS-style finding that trust in neighbors fell ~7% during the pandemic’s worst phase. Indeed, a global study estimated a **6 percentage point drop in people saying they trust their neighbors** from 2018 to mid-2020, likely due to social distancing and isolation【7†L151-L159】【7†L152-L160】. In England, researchers saw a **decrease in neighborhood cohesion and trust** during Covid, especially among poorer and minority groups【8†L7-L11】. But crucially, this seems to have been a temporary blip. By 2022, Britain actually ranked as one of the **most trusting countries** in the world: **84% of Britons said they trust people in their neighborhood**, up from 78% back in 2005【62†L159-L166】【62†L229-L236】. Likewise, the share agreeing that “most people can be trusted” rebounded to **46% – the highest since the early 1980s**【5†L220-L228】. *This is the opposite of* an atomized mistrustful society. As one analysis noted, despite all the culture-war rhetoric, **social trust in the UK hit a 40-year high** – “completely at odds with the image of a nation at war with itself”【5†L242-L250】【5†L243-L252】. In other words, Brits **think** society is less kind (thanks to gloomy news and online doom-scrolling), but objective measures show **trust and tolerance have increased**, not collapsed. \n\nNegative news cycles definitely play a role in **perceptions**. Sensational media stories about “neighbors from hell” or rising crime can make people *believe* others have become selfish or nasty. But often this is more perception than reality. The user mentioned an ONS stat about fewer people trusting their neighbors – it’s likely many *believe* “people have gotten worse” even if their actual experiences haven’t changed much. Constant headlines demonizing others (from benefit “scroungers” to “selfish panic buyers”) fuel a narrative that everyone’s become a jerk. Yet on concrete measures, Britons remain quite community-minded: for example, **84% would trust a stranger of another nationality**, one of the highest rates globally【5†L175-L183】【5†L181-L188】. And neighborhood trust in the UK (84%) is higher than in the US (72%) and almost on par with famously high-trust nations like Norway【62†L229-L236】【62†L231-L236】. **Brits still trust each other**, even if they’re pessimistic in surveys about “society these days.” It’s a gap between *perceived* social decline and actual attitudes. \n\n## Pandemic Behaviors: Altruism vs Frustration  \nAt the start of the pandemic, we saw some **heart-warming altruism**. Remember the spontaneous **mutual aid groups**? In March 2020, thousands of local volunteer groups formed (often via Facebook or WhatsApp) to help elderly and vulnerable neighbors with shopping, medicine, etc. Far from being fleeting, a study found **over 40% of those Covid mutual-aid groups were still active 2 years later**, having evolved into permanent community support hubs【10†L23-L30】【10†L83-L91】. They shifted to running food banks, mental health support, refugee assistance, and more. This shows a significant minority of people **stepped up and kept at it**, hardly the actions of a selfish society. \n\nThe weekly **“Clap for Carers”** in spring 2020 is another example. Despite our user’s skepticism, this ritual was actually very widespread across social classes. Polling in June 2020 showed **69% of Britons took part in Clap for Carers at least once**, and 29% went out to clap every single week【12†L338-L347】. (Older people were most likely to participate – two-thirds of over-65s did – but even 44% of young adults joined at some point【12†L338-L342】.) Sure, not everyone did it, and some found it performative, but **most people genuinely wanted to show solidarity** with NHS workers. In fact, **73% of Britons believed their neighbors were sincere when clapping** (only 8% viewed non-clappers negatively)【12†L323-L332】【12†L333-L340】. So, contrary to the idea it was just in “Stepford” nice neighborhoods, **millions participated** – from council estates to cul-de-sacs – as a collective show of appreciation. It may have been a “gimmick” in hindsight, but at the time it gave people a small way to feel united and supportive. Realistically, it was a brief emotional outlet (by summer 2020, 50% felt it had become less meaningful)【12†L355-L363】. Still, it demonstrated that **empathy wasn’t dead** – people were eager to express gratitude to others, even if only by making noise for a few minutes. \n\nOf course, **not all pandemic social trends were positive**. By late 2020 and 2021, many people were *frazzled, isolated, and irritable*. Online, this often manifested as **more hate and sniping on social media**. Studies indeed found a **“widespread propagation of hateful content” during the pandemic period**【13†L33-L37】, with Twitter and other platforms seeing surges of anger and polarization. Cooped up at home for months, **folks got rusty at basic social empathy** – if you barely see other humans, it’s easy to vent rage behind a keyboard. The user astutely noted that people weren’t necessarily **hating others more deeply**; rather, they *forgot to practice empathy* for “23.9 hours a day” and got swept into toxic online reactions. Psychological research suggests there *was* some social skill atrophy: for example, one study found the pandemic had a **“detrimental impact on empathic social skills”** (our ability to interact and read others), even though people’s core capacity for empathy remained intact【19†L10-L18】. In plain terms, lockdown made us a bit more awkward and less patient with each other, at least temporarily. \n\nThere was also intergenerational finger-pointing. A 2021 King’s College London survey highlighted how **young people were widely perceived as selfish during Covid** – **49% of UK adults (and even 46% of Gen Z themselves!) said the young had ignored rules and been selfish**, versus ~31% who called them selfless【1†L174-L183】【1†L180-L186】. Meanwhile older people were presumed to have “suffered most” from the pandemic, yet paradoxically **older folks were most likely to report no serious negative effects on their lives**【1†L160-L167】【1†L188-L196】. This suggests a lot of **misperception**: the young were vilified in the narrative (parties in parks, etc.), even though **most youth did follow the rules**, and they arguably sacrificed normal life more than retirees did. Likewise, many young people felt **older generations were selfish** (hoarding vaccines or demanding lockdowns that preserved pensions but hurt jobs). These beliefs on both sides weren’t entirely fair – they were fueled by frustration and media anecdotes more than by the **majority’s actual behavior**. The reality is **most Britons, young and old, complied with the restrictions and helped each other** as best they could. But each generation tended to **highlight the worst examples of the other** (teens seeing rule-breaking boomers and vice versa), feeding a narrative of “everyone else acted badly.” It’s a case of *belief* diverging from *reality* in the midst of stress. \n\n## Signs of “Selfish” Behavior: Reasons and Context  \nThe user mentioned several observable upticks in inconsiderate behavior – **fly-tipping, panic-buying, careless driving**, etc. These did happen, but again the context is key. \n\n- **Fly-tipping (illegal dumping of rubbish)**: This surged in 2020–21, but largely due to *circumstances*. During the first lockdown, **councils closed many recycling centres and suspended bulky waste collections**, so people literally had nowhere to legally dump old mattresses or renovation debris for a while【25†L203-L210】. Combined with a pandemic DIY boom (lots of home clear-outs and garden projects) and perhaps some opportunistic rogue waste haulers, it led to a **16% jump in fly-tipping incidents in England** (1.13 million cases in 2020/21, up from 980k the year before)【25†L167-L175】. Household waste made up the vast majority of the problem【25†L163-L170】. But this wasn’t simply Britons becoming trash bandits overnight – **the system made proper disposal harder**, and a subset of people took the shortcut. Even when tips reopened, new friction (e.g. booking slots, long queues) may have kept illegal dumping high. It’s telling that enforcement actions *fell* during that time (pandemic staff shortages)【25†L173-L180】, so perpetrators faced little deterrent. So yes, more **selfish environmental damage** happened, but mostly because *“when doing the right thing got harder, more chose the easy wrong.”* Government analysis acknowledged that **lockdown closures and lifestyle changes “may have contributed” to the fly-tipping increase**【25†L203-L210】. In other words, blame the circumstances as much as the people. (By 2022/23, fly-tipping rates actually leveled off or decreased slightly as services normalized【24†L1-L8】.) \n\n【45†embed_image】 *Figure: Piles of fly-tipped household rubbish in a rural area of Oxfordshire during 2020. Fly-tipping incidents spiked by ~16% in England amid pandemic disruptions【25†L167-L175】【25†L203-L210】.* \n\n- **Panic-buying**: The images of empty supermarket shelves and hoarded toilet rolls in March 2020 are seared in everyone’s mind. But this was a very **short-lived blip** at the start of the crisis. Media coverage was certainly “sensationalised” – an analysis of newspaper reporting found **64% of photos showed empty shelves** and 89% of articles used alarmist language【27†L175-L183】【27†L169-L177】, which probably *amplified* the public’s urge to stockpile. In reality, while there were genuine temporary shortages (certain goods sold out for a couple weeks), supply chains adjusted quickly. By the summer of 2020, panic-buying subsided and goods were available (with purchase limits) – and most people went back to normal shopping habits. **Surveys later showed many Britons barely remembered the toilet paper frenzy** aside from it being a weird anecdote. It didn’t fundamentally erode people’s trust in each other long-term. Even during the peak, **most Britons disapproved of the hoarding** (“some dickheads buying up all the loo roll,” as the user’s nan said), showing that the **social norm against selfish hoarding was strong**, even if a minority briefly succumbed to fear. So panic-buying was **real but fleeting** – a knee-jerk “everyone for themselves” moment under extreme uncertainty. It doesn’t indicate a permanent turn to selfishness; rather it demonstrates how **crisis anxiety can override empathy** briefly. Once reassurance came (supermarkets imploring “shop responsibly”), the vast majority complied. \n\n- **Partygate and public anger**: When it emerged that government officials (including the Prime Minister) broke lockdown rules to hold parties, the public’s **ire was intense**. People weren’t necessarily more angry at *each other* – they were angry at **leaders’ hypocrisy**. Polls at the time showed a large majority of Britons felt “anger” and “betrayal” about Partygate, and around **54% thought the PM should resign over it** (which he eventually did)【30†L191-L199】【30†L200-L208】. However, our user suggests many regular people *expected* that behavior and were actually more upset about pandemic profiteering (like billions wasted on faulty PPE contracts). It’s true the **VIP lane contracts and PPE scandals** amounting to tens of billions in suspected waste/corruption got less media heat than the juicy partying story. But Britons do care about those issues: in late 2024 the new government even appointed a **“Covid corruption commissioner” to claw back money**, reviewing **£600+ million of suspect contracts** that the previous administration had planned to write off【30†L177-L185】【30†L198-L207】. So concern for fairness and accountability is alive and well – people hate to see rule-breaking and selfish profiteering **at the top**. If anything, Partygate *fueled* the narrative that “nobody follows rules anymore,” but the irony is ordinary Brits *did* follow rules (often painfully so); it was a few officials who acted selfishly. This saga probably did erode social trust *in government* (and maybe made folks more cynical generally), but it wasn’t Britons becoming more selfish – it was Britons seeing their leaders as selfish. \n\n- **Driving behavior**: Anecdotally, many have noticed **worse driving etiquette** since the pandemic – less courtesy, more speeding and aggression. There’s some data to back this. A UK survey by Brake/Direct Line found that by early 2021, **9 in 10 drivers admitted to feeling stressed or angry behind the wheel**, a **6% increase** from pre-pandemic【32†L47-L55】. Over 1 in 10 drivers said they now feel **rage every single time** they drive (up from about 7% before)【32†L51-L59】. So yes, **road rage and frustration are up**. During the lockdowns, with roads empty, many drivers got used to speeding – police reported **higher instances of extreme speeding** in spring 2020 (some taking advantage of quiet motorways)【32†L89-L97】. Globally, studies noted that **reduced traffic led to more risky driving**: e.g. average speeds rose and harsh braking/acceleration incidents increased by 10–12%【32†L89-L97】. Unfortunately, those habits may have stuck even after traffic returned. Add to that the general stress people carry (long commutes, rushing between jobs, or just a shorter fuse post-lockdown), and you get more **impatient, careless driving** – e.g. not signaling, running amber lights, parking selfishly. This is a form of civic behavior decline, but again it ties to **wider conditions**: people are in a hurry, mentally strained, or out of practice after months off the road. New drivers who had less training due to test backlogs might also contribute. The good news: it’s fixable with time and maybe a bit of enforcement/education. It’s not that Britons *decided* to collectively become inconsiderate drivers; rather **circumstances (empty roads, then frayed nerves)** encouraged worse habits. Notably, **self-reported stress while driving jumped during Covid** and has remained elevated【32†L47-L55】 – meaning if life pressure eases, driving behavior could improve too. \n\n- **“Survival mode” mentality**: An opinion piece in *The Independent* argued that many people feel they are “surviving, not living” due to economic and pandemic stresses. Indeed, a 2022 survey found **61% of Britons agreed that “the social contract in Britain is broken”**, indicating a deep frustration with how society is functioning【35†L33-L41】. When people feel the system isn’t working for them, they become more likely to **look out for themselves** above all. It’s not a moral failing so much as a protective response to systemic failure. If you feel **no one’s looking after you**, you’re less inclined to go out of your way for others. This might explain some of the decreased patience and civic engagement. However, it’s important to emphasize: even in “survival mode,” **Britons’ core values haven’t flipped to pure individualism**. Public attitudes data consistently show strong support for **collective responsibility**. For example, at the end of 2021, a **majority of Britons (52%) – including 46% of Tory voters – said they want higher taxes and more spending on health, education, and social benefits**【37†L85-L93】【37†L89-L92】. That level of support for the welfare state was basically unchanged from pre-pandemic times. Likewise, **nearly half (49%) of the public now agree that government should redistribute income from the rich to the less well-off**, up 10 percentage points since 2019【37†L91-L99】. Concern about inequality *rose* during the pandemic: **67% say ordinary working people don’t get a fair share of wealth**, also up significantly【37†L95-L100】. These are not the views of a newly selfish populace – they signal **more desire for fairness and help for the vulnerable**. So while people might be grumpier day-to-day, their underlying **belief in helping others via the state remains robust**. \n\n## System Failures vs Personal “Selfishness”  \nStepping back, a clear pattern emerges: **many of these issues result from policy and system shortcomings, rather than a moral collapse of society**. When **regular folks face more cost or friction to “do the right thing,” some percentage will take the shortcut** (even if they feel bad about it). It’s human nature across any society. The UK has been through a gauntlet of crises – austerity, Brexit, pandemic, inflation – that have stretched institutions and safety nets thin. In such an environment, **civic behavior can fray at the edges**, but it’s more a symptom of stress than a sudden loss of ethics. \n\nIt’s telling that whenever structures were put in place to make altruism easier, Britons responded eagerly. For instance, the **Homes for Ukraine scheme** in 2022 (which provided a framework and funding for hosting refugees) saw an overwhelming response – **over 100,000 Britons signed up in just the first few days to offer their homes to Ukrainian refugees**【38†L8-L16】. That generosity went well beyond what anyone anticipated. (Of course, some placements didn’t work out, and tabloids honed in on the negative anecdotes – but many thousands of Ukrainians were successfully hosted by UK families, a testament to compassion in action.) The key is, the government *lowered the barrier* to helping (by organizing visas and support payments), and Britons jumped at the chance to help strangers in need. Similarly, during the vaccine rollout, millions volunteered time or at least **waited their turn without widespread queue-jumping**, indicating social cooperation for the common good. \n\nWhen systems *fail*, however – like inadequate mental health care, or overwhelmed council services – individuals are left to fend for themselves and may act “selfishly” out of desperation or frustration. The user’s line *“everything is about personal responsibility because it’s cheaper than fixing the system”* rings true. If you make people fight over scarce resources (be it gas pumps during a shortage or slots for a GP appointment), you unfortunately encourage zero-sum behavior. But **those same people would likely prefer not to behave that way** if the system provided for basic needs securely. \n\nIn conclusion, **Britons as a whole have not actually become more selfish or uncaring**. The evidence shows continued (even increased) support for collective aid and high interpersonal trust. What has changed is that **many feel others are more selfish**, a belief fueled by stressful experiences and negative narratives. And under mounting pressure, *some* behaviors have deteriorated at the margins – an understandable human response to tough times. The “missing 27p” out of each pound isn’t sitting in someone’s selfish pocket; it’s **being eaten by rising rents, energy bills, and food costs**, leaving people with little capacity to be as charitable or community-active as before. Yet, when given the opportunity and support to help others, Britons have still proven very willing (from clapping for carers, to mutual aid, to hosting refugees). \n\nSo, to directly answer the user’s query: **people aren’t inherently nastier now**. Objective data suggests they’re *just as community-minded*, if not more tolerant, than before. But **many believe everyone else has become selfish**, partly because they see instances of bad behavior and a government that often emphasizes individual responsibility. It’s easier to lose faith in society when your daily life is a struggle and you’re bombarded with stories of “others behaving badly.” The real task is rebuilding those systems and narratives – when people feel more secure and see common purpose, they quickly revert to cooperative, empathetic behavior. As one researcher (Prof. Bobby Duffy of KCL) put it, Britain is not the dystopia of clashing selfish tribes that some imagine; in fact, **social solidarity survived Covid and Brexit better than expected**【5†L242-L250】. Britons largely still **believe in helping each other**, even if they’re bone-tired and grumbling while they do it. \n\n**Sources:** Detailed statistical and survey data have been drawn from: Charities Aid Foundation reports on giving (showing donor declines)【59†L172-L179】, the UK Community Life Survey and NCVO data on volunteering【61†L13-L20】【61†L33-L36】, King’s College London/World Values Survey research on trust and social attitudes【62†L159-L166】【62†L229-L236】, YouGov polls on community behaviors like Clap for Carers【12†L338-L347】【12†L329-L337】, academic studies on pandemic effects (e.g. empathy and social cohesion)【19†L10-L18】【8†L7-L11】, government stats on fly-tipping and inflation【25†L167-L175】【25†L203-L210】【58†L89-L97】, and British Social Attitudes surveys on welfare and inequality【37†L85-L93】【37†L91-L99】. All reinforce the conclusion that **systemic pressures, more than moral decay, explain the trends** in question. Britons may *feel* like the social fabric has torn, but the fabric is more resilient than it seems – it’s just strained by the weight placed upon it. 【5†L243-L252】【37†L85-L93】\n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":340,"end_ix":352,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Rising cost of living in the UK - House of Commons Library","url":"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9428/#:~:text=We%20can%20also%20look%20at,in%20total","text":"We can also look at the change in prices over a longer time period to gauge the overall impact of the period of high inflation.
