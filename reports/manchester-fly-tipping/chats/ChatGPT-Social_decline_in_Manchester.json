A few overlapping things are feeding into it in Manchester (and across the UK more broadly):  \n\n- **Cuts to services** – Over the last decade, councils have had big budget cuts. Fewer youth clubs, fewer outreach workers, fewer neighbourhood officers. That gap leaves kids and young people without structure, and antisocial behaviour fills the void.  \n\n- **Policing changes** – Neighbourhood policing used to be about officers knowing their patch, being visible, intervening early. That’s been hollowed out. Now response times are slow, and low-level stuff (fly-tipping, noise, petty vandalism) rarely gets dealt with. People see there’s no consequence.  \n\n- **Economic pressure** – Rising costs, stagnant wages, insecure work. Stress and frustration get vented in public spaces. You see more short tempers, less patience, less care for community spaces.  \n\n- **Social fragmentation** – A mix of phone/online life replacing physical community, less trust in neighbours, and less collective responsibility. People stop feeling “this street is ours,” and it becomes “not my problem.”  \n\n- **Culture shift** – Social media and TikTok amplify showing off, pranks, and performative toughness. Balaclavas, scooters, stunts, insulting strangers — they’re signalling status in front of peers.  \n\n- **Weak enforcement on driving/antisocial behaviour** – Cameras catch speeding, but signalling, tailgating, or noisy driving rarely get touched. When people see rules ignored without consequences, norms break down.  \n\nPut simply: a combination of **austerity, neglect, stress, and a collapse of shared norms**. It’s not everyone, but the ones acting out are more visible because there’s no one stopping them and fewer people challenging them.  \n\nDo you want me to pull up what Manchester council or GMP (Greater Manchester Police) are currently doing about antisocial behaviour specifically, so you can see if there are any active initiatives or reporting channels?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"9737a0945ed2cd4c-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"f16c1583-d918-4a98-b457-6a8c85805c00","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f16c1583-d918-4a98-b457-6a8c85805c00","children":["64cfde40-238b-4db6-9844-8548af2d01dd"]},"64cfde40-238b-4db6-9844-8548af2d01dd":{"id":"64cfde40-238b-4db6-9844-8548af2d01dd","message":{"id":"64cfde40-238b-4db6-9844-8548af2d01dd","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1755920898.431,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["that actually makes sense thanks.

Some describe incidents such as teens carrying knives and aggressive behavior from young people on scooters. In one tragic example, a restaurant owner was killed during a carjacking in 2021.\n\nThough Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and local authorities claim progress through operations like Challenger and Venture—which target organized crime and youth violence—many locals feel little has changed.

The investigations currently involve 714 victims and 1,099 suspects. Since 2019, GMP has made significant improvements in handling such cases, particularly in understanding and addressing child sexual exploitation. Despite efforts to rebuild trust, some victims remain disillusioned due to past failures. Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson emphasized that all those responsible, including those who failed survivors, will be held accountable. Ethnicity’s role in these crimes may be examined in an upcoming national inquiry, as Asian men have been found disproportionately represented among suspects. GMP is the only UK police force with a dedicated unit—Child Sexual Exploitation Major Investigation Team (CSE MIT)—staffed by about 100 specialists. However, police face challenges like data access issues from local councils, which delay investigations. So far, these efforts have led to 42 convictions totaling over 430 years in prison.

Inspired by a successful Greater Manchester Police initiative, the policy aims to rebuild public trust and reduce crimes such as burglary, vehicle theft, and shoplifting. Each neighbourhood will receive a named, contactable police officer and dedicated anti-social behaviour lead. The broader strategy includes hiring 13,000 additional neighbourhood policing officers by 2029, with the first third to be deployed soon. The plan also includes increased deployment of both visible and undercover officers in crime hotspots. Starmer emphasized that all communities deserve local, visible, trustworthy policing and aimed to reverse a decade-long decline in frontline policing. The move comes as Labour seeks to strengthen its policy platform ahead of local elections. The initiative contrasts with past Conservative cuts to policing and responds to public concerns, with recent polls indicating widespread dissatisfaction with the government’s handling of crime.

In response, concert organizers and Manchester police have deployed 2,000 stewards, a significant police presence, and double fencing with mobile patrols to safeguard the area. Concerns are growing over crowd safety, with estimates suggesting that tens of thousands of unauthorized fans could show up. Past incidents at the Parklife festival prompted Greater Manchester Police to implement extensive measures to prevent disorder, and similar preparations are underway for Oasis.

Reflecting on his career since 1987, Marsh laments the decline in arrests and erosion of public confidence due to neglect of fundamental policing practices. He criticizes the diversion of police resources to minor social media disputes and advocates for a return to core duties such as investigating theft, shoplifting, and antisocial behavior.\n\nMarsh calls for more use of common sense in policing, an end to recording non-crime hate incidents (NCHIs), and discourages officers from engaging in perceived activism. He highlights the importance of consistent, professional neighborhood policing, citing pilot programs training officers to better engage communities and combat local crime. Emphasizing the “broken windows” theory, Marsh asserts that tolerating minor offenses encourages more serious crimes. He also warns against leniency on public cannabis use and emphasizes that visible law enforcement is critical for public assurance.

Inspired by a successful Greater Manchester Police initiative, the policy aims to rebuild public trust and reduce crimes such as burglary, vehicle theft, and shoplifting. Each neighbourhood will receive a named, contactable police officer and dedicated anti-social behaviour lead. The broader strategy includes hiring 13,000 additional neighbourhood policing officers by 2029, with the first third to be deployed soon. The plan also includes increased deployment of both visible and undercover officers in crime hotspots. Starmer emphasized that all communities deserve local, visible, trustworthy policing and aimed to reverse a decade-long decline in frontline policing. The move comes as Labour seeks to strengthen its policy platform ahead of local elections. The initiative contrasts with past Conservative cuts to policing and responds to public concerns, with recent polls indicating widespread dissatisfaction with the government’s handling of crime. Although welcomed by police forces, some officials expressed concerns about funding limitations and resource allocation.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2"},{"matched_text":"navlistMore on related recent coverageturn0news18,turn0news24","start_idx":5661,"end_idx":5726,"safe_urls":["https://media.guim.co.uk/0938042fd4af3dcbe71f8f4808476b69d8ee1051/0_183_5500_3300/500.jpg","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/09/keir-starmer-to-unveil-plans-for-police-officers-on-foot-to-patrol-every-busy-neighbourhood?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/15221500/zombie-drugs-manchester-piccadilly-gardens/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ac-15_08-crackadilly-gardens-comp.jpg?resize=500"],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":18},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24}],"alt":"- [The Scottish Sun](https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/15221500/zombie-drugs-manchester-piccadilly-gardens/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/09/keir-starmer-to-unveil-plans-for-police-officers-on-foot-to-patrol-every-busy-neighbourhood?utm_source=chatgpt.com)","prompt_text":"\nnavlist containing the following URLs:\n- [Our proud city's oasis has turned into dangerous crime den overrun by zombie druggies and thugs who rob pensioners](https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/15221500/zombie-drugs-manchester-piccadilly-gardens/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Keir Starmer to unveil plans for police officers on foot to patrol every busy neighbourhood](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/09/keir-starmer-to-unveil-plans-for-police-officers-on-foot-to-patrol-every-busy-neighbourhood?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n","type":"nav_list","title":"More on related recent coverage","items":[{"title":"Our proud city's oasis has turned into dangerous crime den overrun by zombie druggies and thugs who rob pensioners","url":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/15221500/zombie-drugs-manchester-piccadilly-gardens/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","thumbnail_url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ac-15_08-crackadilly-gardens-comp.jpg?resize=500","pub_date":1755416485,"attribution":"The Scottish Sun"},{"title":"Keir Starmer to unveil plans for police officers on foot to patrol every busy neighbourhood","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/09/keir-starmer-to-unveil-plans-for-police-officers-on-foot-to-patrol-every-busy-neighbourhood?utm_source=chatgpt.com","thumbnail_url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/0938042fd4af3dcbe71f8f4808476b69d8ee1051/0_183_5500_3300/500.jpg","pub_date":1744234210,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"user_time_zone":"Europe/London"},{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":5726,"end_idx":5726,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[{"title":"Stop It!

you’ve hit on the core contradiction: delivery riders are caught in a system that basically forces them into **unsafe and antisocial practices** just to survive.  \n\n- **Platforms like Deliveroo, Uber Eats, JustEat** only reward speed and availability. If you don’t ride aggressively, take shortcuts, or keep online constantly, you don’t get jobs. So riders push red lights, ride pavements, use modified e-bikes, and burn themselves out.  \n\n- Most riders are **self-employed contractors**, not employees. That means:  \n  - No sick pay, holiday pay, or guaranteed minimum.  \n  - They cover their own insurance/maintenance (which many can’t afford).  \n  - Pay is often below minimum wage once you factor in waiting time.  \n\n- **Immigration status plays in**: a lot of riders are migrants with limited options. They’ll take risks or use unlicensed bikes because there’s no other way to make rent.  \n\n- Police “operations” against them (seizing bikes, immigration raids) don’t change the system — they just punish the people at the bottom. The platforms walk away untouched.  \n\nSo yeah, it looks like the authorities are “tackling ASB,” but what they’re actually doing is **criminalising poverty and precarious work**, instead of addressing why delivery work forces this behaviour.  \n\nIf you want, I can pull up whether Manchester has any *alternative measures* (like licensing schemes, safer delivery infrastructure, or union campaigns) rather than just enforcement.

Most of what’s being rolled out is **theatre**: visible operations, crackdowns, consultations, campaigns. They create the *appearance* of grip, but don’t touch the roots—poverty, lack of spaces for young people, fragmented community, platform exploitation, zero accountability for corporations, weak enforcement on actual dangerous behaviour.  \n\nThe cycle usually goes:  \n1. Something becomes a visible public nuisance.  \n2. Politicians/media push for “action.”  \n3. Police run an operation, seize some bikes/blades/do a few arrests.  \n4.

Community voices express frustration and fear, particularly regarding youth involvement in crime and the lack of police response.

A vigorous \"Save Our Club\" campaign, raising £38,000, achieved a boardroom shake-up, halting the eviction.

The CIC and its supporters argue that under company law, the building should only be used as a social club. Efforts to save the club include fundraising and a legal challenge, with strong community backing and a petition gathering nearly 7,000 signatures. The club's appeal spans generations, playing a crucial role in fostering local relationships and offering varied events and services.

Councils and charities get money for a *launch*, not for **5 years of caretaking**. It’s cheaper politically to “open” something than to actually embed it.  \n\nThe result: shiny buildings that feel empty or hostile (like your Gorton examples), “community hubs” designed like airports, not like places people want to linger, sports schemes that reach a dozen kids out of thousands.  \n\nThe deeper failure is **design without belonging**. If you build things that feel sterile, corporate, or surveilled, people avoid them. If there’s no consistent human presence (trusted youth workers, caretakers, neighbours who live the project), the space decays fast.  \n\nThat’s why alley gardens work briefly — the idea is sound — but if no one has time/ownership to defend it, fly-tippers win. Same for youth spaces: if it feels like a prison atrium instead of a third place, young people vote with their feet.  \n\nSo you’re not being cynical — you’re describing exactly why the “solutions” feel hollow. They’re **gestures**, not rooted in ongoing, lived community.  \n\nThe stuff that lasts tends to look very different:  \n- **Spaces people actually want to use** (warm, informal, human-scaled).  \n- **Community ownership** (not just consultation, but control).  \n- **Permanent staffing** (caretakers/youth workers embedded for years, not projects).  \n- **Design for people, not for optics** (cozy, messy, alive—not clinical glass boxes).  \n\nAnd honestly: Manchester isn’t doing that at scale. It’s doing showcase fixes.  \n\nDo you want me to dig into whether there are *any* genuinely community-owned and run spaces in Manchester that *aren’t* council-led or corpo-funded (so they don’t fall into the “shiny but soulless” trap)? Those are the only ones that tend to stick."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"9737af675c52cd4c-LHR","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"59f18cd4-f8e3-4b5e-9948-d6913e104668","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"59f18cd4-f8e3-4b5e-9948-d6913e104668","children":["424e5e89-5403-4390-9d69-7c9197ef355a"]},"424e5e89-5403-4390-9d69-7c9197ef355a":{"id":"424e5e89-5403-4390-9d69-7c9197ef355a","message":{"id":"424e5e89-5403-4390-9d69-7c9197ef355a","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1755921540.037,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["okay, I'm beginning to see why Reform are raring right now, people are fucking sick of empty gestures that eat up as much money as could be used to provide real solutions"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9737b1db1f8acd4c-LHR","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e7fbc1b4-672d-4dac-914a-b7f8b035e2d2","children":["aa8e61b3-34a7-4636-b83b-0fab7e5e4c7b"]},"aa8e61b3-34a7-4636-b83b-0fab7e5e4c7b":{"id":"aa8e61b3-34a7-4636-b83b-0fab7e5e4c7b","message":{"id":"aa8e61b3-34a7-4636-b83b-0fab7e5e4c7b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1755921540.52119,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Exactly. That’s why Reform are biting through the noise — not because they’ve got coherent answers, but because they tap that **raw frustration** with:  \n\n- **Money wasted on optics** → vanity hubs, one-off schemes, endless “consultations.”  \n- **Institutions that feel alien** → sterile glass boxes, cops showing up only for photo-ops, “community spaces” nobody actually wants to be in.  \n- **Short-termism** → a burst of activity, then abandonment.  \n\nPeople look around at litter, fly-tipping, noise, reckless driving, youth in balaclavas — and then see the council spend millions on what feels like Potemkin fixes. That dissonance is gasoline for populists. Reform don’t need real plans, they just need to say, “The establishment wastes your money and ignores you,” and it lands, because it matches lived experience.  \n\nWhat people actually crave is **competence + continuity**. Not even utopia — just:  \n- Someone visibly keeping things in order.  \n- Places that feel welcoming instead of cold or surveilled.  \n- A sense that if you report a problem, it’s dealt with.  \n\nInstead they get *gesture politics*. And yeah — that gap is exactly the space Reform are moving into.  \n\nWant me to map how much Reform are gaining right now in Greater Manchester specifically (like ward/council level), so you can see
