# Manchester Fly Tipping â€” Causes and Fixes (Placeholder)

This is a placeholder outline for the Manchester fly tipping report. It will cover:

- What the data says about incidents, hotspots and seasonal patterns
- Root causes (waste charges, bulky pickups, landlord churn, awareness)
- What works elsewhere (enforcement, outreach, service design)
- Practical options for Manchester (pilots, costs, timelines, owners)

Full report coming soon.
