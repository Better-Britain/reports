---

###  **1. Early Foundations: Online Harms Strategy**
- **April 2019**: The UK government publishes the **Online Harms White Paper**, setting out the initial framework for internet regulation via statutory codes of practice and a duty of care for online platforms.

- **Late 2022**: In response to civil liberties concerns, provisions requiring takedown of "legal but harmful" content are removed and replaced with requirements for systems to allow users to avoid such content.                               
- **September 2023**: A ministerial statement clarifies that powers to weaken end-to-end encryption will **not be used immediately**, addressing industry and civil liberty worries.

  - Other services, including **Reddit, Bluesky, Discord, Tinder, Bumble, Spotify, X**, implement UK-specific age verification for adult or self-harm-related content.                               
- **International Pushback**:  
  - **August 2025**: Platforms **4chan and Kiwi Farms** file a U.S. lawsuit arguing the Act violates U.S. First Amendment rights, as Ofcom demands "risk assessment" submissions under OSA.                               
  - **U.S. lawmakers** organize hearings to criticize OSA (and the EU’s DSA) for overreach; Nigel Farage is invited to testify.                             

### **6. Enforcement and Public Backlash**

###  **Bottom Line**
The Online Safety Act emerged from early government proposals (2019), was refined through draft bills and stakeholder input (2021–2022), became law in October 2023, and entered a phased rollout starting early 2025. Key milestones include codes of practice, enforcement kicks starting Spring 2025, and full child protection duties from July 2025. Recent months have seen robust enforcement, public controversy over privacy, and legal challenges—most notably from Wikipedia entities and U.S.-based platforms.

Let me know if you'd like the timeline enriched with perspectives from specific stakeholders, detailed legal steps, or international implications!

#### You:
Can you dig deeper and do some thinking to find why Labour implemented it after winning in 2024, when it's such an obviously Tory overreach and poorly thought out policy

#### ChatGPT:
Short answer: Labour didn’t “adopt a Tory bill” so much as inherit a law that was already on the statute book and then decide it was politically safer—and practically easier—to press ahead and shape it than to reopen it.

Here’s the why, boiled down:

- #1 It was a manifesto promise  
  Labour explicitly pledged to “**build on the Online Safety Act**…bringing forward provisions **as quickly as possible**” and even explore going further (e.g., new coroner powers). So delivering fast after July 2024 wasn’t a U-turn; it was the plan.

- #2 Public opinion makes the “soft on child safety” risk deadly  
  In late July 2025, **69% of Britons** told YouGov they supported the new age-verification rules (even though most doubted they would work well). Moving to dilute or delay would have invited “you’re siding with predators” attack lines—exactly the line Peter Kyle used against Reform when repeal was floated.

- #3 The machinery was already rolling  
  The Act got Royal Assent in Oct 2023. By the time Labour took office (Jul 2024), Ofcom had a phased **implementation roadmap** and just needed ministers to do specific bits (lay codes, sign off categorisation thresholds, and make secondary regs).

If you want, I can map the **specific levers** Labour actually pulled (codes they laid, thresholds they set, guidance they green-lit) versus the parts they could still modify without reopening the Act.



#### You:
Yeah I wrote about that yougov poll, but that came out after the law was activated. I want a list of key individuals by party, to add to the timeline. When I think OSA I think Nadine Dorries and Reese Mogg for some reason, but maybe I'm conflating and want to know the real people who made this happen over the years, and what they did. 

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely — here’s a refined list of the **key individuals by party** who played central roles in shaping and delivering the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA), along with what each contributed. This should slot neatly into your timeline, giving you a clearer sense of *who did what*—and dispelling the Nadine Dorries–Rees-Mogg confusion.

### **Conservative Party**

#### **Nadine Dorries** — Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), Sep 2021 – Sep 2022

- **Strengthened the draft** by adding extra “priority illegal offences” such as revenge porn, suicide facilitation, fraud, and hate crime — ensuring Ofcom could act swiftly.                     
- Framed the Bill as a necessary response to rising **online hate and abuse**, including the killing of David Amess, promising to remove “illegal content quickly” and enforce age limits.                     
- Pushed the legislation forward **despite internal resistance**—for example, Oliver Dowden reportedly told her to “kick the Bill into the long grass,” but she insisted on fast passage.                     

#### **Oliver Dowden** — DCMS Secretary, before Dorries (mid-2021)  
- Allegedly advised delaying the Bill, urging Dorries to “kick the Online Safety Bill into the long grass.” ['Huge moment' as Online Safety Bill introduced to parliament](https://www.pensionsage.com/pa/Online-Safety-Bill-introduced-to-parliament.php) [Five things you need to know about the Online Safety Act](https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/blog/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-online-safety-bill/) [The Online Safety Bill Has Been Introduced to Parliament](https://saferinternet.org.uk/blog/the-online-safety-bill-has-been-introduced-to-parliament) [Online Safety Update](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-07-07/hlws191) [Online Safety Bill](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-02/0285/210285.pdf) [Online Safety Bill](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-03/0004/220004.pdf) [Nadine Dorries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_Dorries) [Nadine Dorries Says New Culture Secretary “Doesn't \.\.\.](https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/nadine-dorries-michelle-donelan-doesnt-understand-online-safety-bill) [World\-first online safety laws introduced in Parliament](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-online-safety-laws-introduced-in-parliament) [U\.K\. introduces online safety bill](https://www.axios.com/2022/03/17/uk-introduces-online-safety-bill) [Why the Online Safety Bill is proving so controversial](https://news.sky.com/story/why-the-online-safety-bill-is-proving-so-controversial-12757804) [Online Safety Act 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Safety_Act_2023) [Oliver Dowden told Nadine Dorries to 'kick Online Safety \.\.\.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nadine-dorries-online-safety-bill-dowden-b2434863.html) [Nadine Dorries commits to online safety reforms in memory \.\.\.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/23/nadine-dorries-commits-to-online-safety-reforms-in-memory-of-david-amess) [Online safety law to be strengthened to stamp out illegal \.\.\.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/online-safety-law-to-be-strengthened-to-stamp-out-illegal-content) [The UK's Online Safety Bill: Where is it Now?](https://techpolicy.press/the-uks-online-safety-bill-where-is-it-now) [Beeban Kidron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeban_Kidron) [UK Council for Child Internet Safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Council_for_Child_Internet_Safety) [UK Internet age verification system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Internet_age_verification_system)

### **Labour Party**

- Labour MPs and Lords engaged during debates, scrutiny, and committee stages — but **no single Labour figure** currently stands out in the public record as a driver of the Bill.  
- Labour's role has largely been that of **opposition scrutiny**, influencing amendments around **free speech**, **encryption**, and **harm categories**, though without claiming authorship of policy direction.

### **Civic & Campaign Stakeholders (Not MPs but influential)**

Let me know if you’d like to dig into Labour’s critiques, amendments tabled, or committee members who influenced the Bill’s reshaping during its passage — I can fully trace and cite those too.



#### You:
Is there any reasoning available for why Labour put supporting it in their manifesto? Can you find objections or support in hansard or find any other explanations for them being so eager to get it going aside from a general habit of digital privacy erosion and a failure to consider the implications in general from UK politicians?

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly—I’ve found some concrete evidence and statements that illuminate *why* Labour chose to commit to advancing the Online Safety Act in their 2024 manifesto, beyond broad assumptions.

## 1. **Labour’s Affirmation of "A Higher Bar for Online Safety"**

From a **Hansard debate on 12 September 2023**, Labour MP Lucy Powell made it explicit:

> “Labour supports the principles of the Online Safety Bill. There has been a wild west online for too long. Huge platforms such as Facebook and Google … lack of regulation has let harms and abuses proliferate.” [Monday briefing: ​Why opponents of the Online Safety Act \.\.\.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/04/monday-briefing-why-opponents-of-the-online-safety-act-arent-on-jimmy-saviles-side) [Legislative Comment: The Online Safety Act 2023 and the \.\.\.](https://academic.oup.com/slr/article/46/2/hmaf021/8203212) [Amendment to the Motion: 24 Feb 2025](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2025-02-24a.1524.0&s=wikipedia) [UK Election 2024: How will they tackle children's online \.\.\.](https://5rightsfoundation.com/uk-election-2024-how-will-they-tackle-childrens-online-safety/) [Why the Online Safety Act has become a political \.\.\.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPXRRjsTtAQ) [What's coming up in Parliament this \.\.\.](https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/news/parliament-matters-bulletin-1-september-2025) [Online Safety 2\.0](https://flint-global.com/blog/online-safety-2-0/) [Online Safety Bill](https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/bills/2021-22/onlinesafety/debates) [Break down barriers to opportunity](https://labour.org.uk/change/break-down-barriers-to-opportunity/) [Change Labour Party Manifesto 2024](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Change-Labour-Party-Manifesto-2024-large-print.pdf) [Implementation of the Online Safety Act](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/) [Online Safety Bill \- Hansard \- UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-01-17/debates/9E767367-16E1-4A11-9766-6A4EDFEC4F1C/OnlineSafetyBill) [Online Safety Act: explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer) [Manifesto watch: the headlines](https://www.onlinesafetyact.net/analysis/manifesto-watch-the-headlines/) [Petition "Repeal the Online Safety Act" has reached \.\.\.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1m98dtk/petition_repeal_the_online_safety_act_has_reached/) [Labour vows to toughen child online safety law after Ofcom criticised](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-vows-to-toughen-child-online-safety-law-after-ofcom-criticised-nw9jqr29c) [Scrolling through the UK political parties' online safety \.\.\.](https://techinsights.linklaters.com/post/102jbno/scrolling-through-the-uk-political-parties-online-safety-promises) [Online Safety Bill \- Hansard \- UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-09-12/debates/81853BB7-375E-45C0-8C9D-4169AC36DD12/OnlineSafetyBill) [Lucy Powell \- All Online Safety Act 2023 Contributions](https://parallelparliament.co.uk/mp/lucy-powell/bill/2021-22/onlinesafety) [Farage is 'siding with Savile' by opposing online safety laws](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/online-safety-act-dark-web-nigel-farage-2lnfgvbds) [Transcript: Trump turbulence \- How should Labour play it?](https://www.ft.com/content/2e8d7ad0-f162-49ce-b664-eecd054ce862) [Farage would enable 'modern\-day Jimmy Saviles', says Jess Phillips](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/farage-wants-to-enable-modern-day-jimmy-saviles-says-jess-phillips-t8fj3xbzs) [Peter Kyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kyle) [TechScape: Could a Labour 'nudification' manifesto bring more safety to AI?](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/19/techscape-labour-thinktank-ai-regulation-deepfake-nudification)

Powell emphasized that:

- Big tech has outgrown its startup roots to now “influence almost every aspect of our lives”—from socializing to news consumption—and regulation has lagged behind.
- The Bill creates a framework of **strong, independent regulation**, which Labour endorsed as a necessary corrective.

---

## 2. **Labour’s Cooperative, Yet Watchful, Position**

Another Bloc in **Hansard, Commons debate (12 Sept 2023)** made the posture clear:

> “Labour has always supported an online safety regime, and has sought to work with the Government while raising valid concerns carefully throughout. … We all want to keep people safe … Labour is proud of the changes it has developed and pushed on … we will continue to push the Government to deliver this regime in good time.” [Monday briefing: ​Why opponents of the Online Safety Act \.\.\.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/04/monday-briefing-why-opponents-of-the-online-safety-act-arent-on-jimmy-saviles-side) [Legislative Comment: The Online Safety Act 2023 and the \.\.\.](https://academic.oup.com/slr/article/46/2/hmaf021/8203212) [Amendment to the Motion: 24 Feb 2025](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2025-02-24a.1524.0&s=wikipedia) [UK Election 2024: How will they tackle children's online \.\.\.](https://5rightsfoundation.com/uk-election-2024-how-will-they-tackle-childrens-online-safety/) [Why the Online Safety Act has become a political \.\.\.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPXRRjsTtAQ) [What's coming up in Parliament this \.\.\.](https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/news/parliament-matters-bulletin-1-september-2025) [Online Safety 2\.0](https://flint-global.com/blog/online-safety-2-0/) [Online Safety Bill](https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/bills/2021-22/onlinesafety/debates) [Break down barriers to opportunity](https://labour.org.uk/change/break-down-barriers-to-opportunity/) [Change Labour Party Manifesto 2024](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Change-Labour-Party-Manifesto-2024-large-print.pdf) [Implementation of the Online Safety Act](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/) [Online Safety Bill \- Hansard \- UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-01-17/debates/9E767367-16E1-4A11-9766-6A4EDFEC4F1C/OnlineSafetyBill) [Online Safety Act: explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer) [Manifesto watch: the headlines](https://www.onlinesafetyact.net/analysis/manifesto-watch-the-headlines/) [Petition "Repeal the Online Safety Act" has reached \.\.\.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1m98dtk/petition_repeal_the_online_safety_act_has_reached/) [Labour vows to toughen child online safety law after Ofcom criticised](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-vows-to-toughen-child-online-safety-law-after-ofcom-criticised-nw9jqr29c) [Scrolling through the UK political parties' online safety \.\.\.](https://techinsights.linklaters.com/post/102jbno/scrolling-through-the-uk-political-parties-online-safety-promises) [Online Safety Bill \- Hansard \- UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-09-12/debates/81853BB7-375E-45C0-8C9D-4169AC36DD12/OnlineSafetyBill) [Lucy Powell \- All Online Safety Act 2023 Contributions](https://parallelparliament.co.uk/mp/lucy-powell/bill/2021-22/onlinesafety) [Farage is 'siding with Savile' by opposing online safety laws](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/online-safety-act-dark-web-nigel-farage-2lnfgvbds) [Transcript: Trump turbulence \- How should Labour play it?](https://www.ft.com/content/2e8d7ad0-f162-49ce-b664-eecd054ce862) [Farage would enable 'modern\-day Jimmy Saviles', says Jess Phillips](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/farage-wants-to-enable-modern-day-jimmy-saviles-says-jess-phillips-t8fj3xbzs) [Peter Kyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kyle) [TechScape: Could a Labour 'nudification' manifesto bring more safety to AI?](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/19/techscape-labour-thinktank-ai-regulation-deepfake-nudification)

Key takeaways:

- Labour didn’t merely support the Bill—they actively collaborated, driving improvements while signalling their intention to maintain oversight and accountability in delivery.

## 3. **Manifesto Pledges: Accelerate and Build Upon the Act**

When reviewing the **2024 Labour manifesto**, while it didn’t explain motivations in deep detail, it clearly committed to advancing the Act:

- Labour pledged to **“build on the Online Safety Act”**, bringing provisions “as quickly as possible,” and exploring further safeguards for digital safety. [Monday briefing: ​Why opponents of the Online Safety Act \.\.\.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/04/monday-briefing-why-opponents-of-the-online-safety-act-arent-on-jimmy-saviles-side) [Legislative Comment: The Online Safety Act 2023 and the \.\.\.](https://academic.oup.com/slr/article/46/2/hmaf021/8203212) [Amendment to the Motion: 24 Feb 2025](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2025-02-24a.1524.0&s=wikipedia) [UK Election 2024: How will they tackle children's online \.\.\.](https://5rightsfoundation.com/uk-election-2024-how-will-they-tackle-childrens-online-safety/) [Why the Online Safety Act has become a political \.\.\.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPXRRjsTtAQ) [What's coming up in Parliament this \.\.\.](https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/news/parliament-matters-bulletin-1-september-2025) [Online Safety 2\.0](https://flint-global.com/blog/online-safety-2-0/) [Online Safety Bill](https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/bills/2021-22/onlinesafety/debates) [Break down barriers to opportunity](https://labour.org.uk/change/break-down-barriers-to-opportunity/) [Change Labour Party Manifesto 2024](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Change-Labour-Party-Manifesto-2024-large-print.pdf) [Implementation of the Online Safety Act](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/) [Online Safety Bill \- Hansard \- UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-01-17/debates/9E767367-16E1-4A11-9766-6A4EDFEC4F1C/OnlineSafetyBill) [Online Safety Act: explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer) [Manifesto watch: the headlines](https://www.onlinesafetyact.net/analysis/manifesto-watch-the-headlines/) [Petition "Repeal the Online Safety Act" has reached \.\.\.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1m98dtk/petition_repeal_the_online_safety_act_has_reached/) [Labour vows to toughen child online safety law after Ofcom criticised](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-vows-to-toughen-child-online-safety-law-after-ofcom-criticised-nw9jqr29c) [Scrolling through the UK political parties' online safety \.\.\.](https://techinsights.linklaters.com/post/102jbno/scrolling-through-the-uk-political-parties-online-safety-promises) [Online Safety Bill \- Hansard \- UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-09-12/debates/81853BB7-375E-45C0-8C9D-4169AC36DD12/OnlineSafetyBill) [Lucy Powell \- All Online Safety Act 2023 Contributions](https://parallelparliament.co.uk/mp/lucy-powell/bill/2021-22/onlinesafety) [Farage is 'siding with Savile' by opposing online safety laws](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/online-safety-act-dark-web-nigel-farage-2lnfgvbds) [Transcript: Trump turbulence \- How should Labour play it?](https://www.ft.com/content/2e8d7ad0-f162-49ce-b664-eecd054ce862) [Farage would enable 'modern\-day Jimmy Saviles', says Jess Phillips](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/farage-wants-to-enable-modern-day-jimmy-saviles-says-jess-phillips-t8fj3xbzs) [Peter Kyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kyle) [TechScape: Could a Labour 'nudification' manifesto bring more safety to AI?](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/19/techscape-labour-thinktank-ai-regulation-deepfake-nudification)

Although not granular, this reflects a strategic decision:

- Labour viewed the OSA not as a Conservative “payload,” but as a functional baseline to *improve upon*—a present regulatory structure they could ethically and politically lean into, rather than dismantle.

---

## 4. **Public and Campaigner Pressure Reinforcing Political Will**

Though not directly cited in their manifesto, significant advocacy shaped the environment:

- The **Times reported (July 2024)** that Labour ministers, led by Science Secretary Peter Kyle, engaged with bereaved families—including the Molly Rose Foundation—to signal commitment to “building on the Online Safety Act” and intensify protections for children. [Monday briefing: ​Why opponents of the Online Safety Act \.\.\.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/04/monday-briefing-why-opponents-of-the-online-safety-act-arent-on-jimmy-saviles-side) [Legislative Comment: The Online Safety Act 2023 and the \.\.\.](https://academic.oup.com/slr/article/46/2/hmaf021/8203212) [Amendment to the Motion: 24 Feb 2025](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2025-02-24a.1524.0&s=wikipedia) [UK Election 2024: How will they tackle children's online \.\.\.](https://5rightsfoundation.com/uk-election-2024-how-will-they-tackle-childrens-online-safety/) [Why the Online Safety Act has become a political \.\.\.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPXRRjsTtAQ) [What's coming up in Parliament this \.\.\.](https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/news/parliament-matters-bulletin-1-september-2025) [Online Safety 2\.0](https://flint-global.com/blog/online-safety-2-0/) [Online Safety Bill](https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/bills/2021-22/onlinesafety/debates) [Break down barriers to opportunity](https://labour.org.uk/change/break-down-barriers-to-opportunity/) [Change Labour Party Manifesto 2024](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Change-Labour-Party-Manifesto-2024-large-print.pdf) [Implementation of the Online Safety Act](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/) [Online Safety Bill \- Hansard \- UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-01-17/debates/9E767367-16E1-4A11-9766-6A4EDFEC4F1C/OnlineSafetyBill) [Online Safety Act: explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer) [Manifesto watch: the headlines](https://www.onlinesafetyact.net/analysis/manifesto-watch-the-headlines/) [Petition "Repeal the Online Safety Act" has reached \.\.\.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1m98dtk/petition_repeal_the_online_safety_act_has_reached/) [Labour vows to toughen child online safety law after Ofcom criticised](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-vows-to-toughen-child-online-safety-law-after-ofcom-criticised-nw9jqr29c) [Scrolling through the UK political parties' online safety \.\.\.](https://techinsights.linklaters.com/post/102jbno/scrolling-through-the-uk-political-parties-online-safety-promises) [Online Safety Bill \- Hansard \- UK Parliament](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-09-12/debates/81853BB7-375E-45C0-8C9D-4169AC36DD12/OnlineSafetyBill) [Lucy Powell \- All Online Safety Act 2023 Contributions](https://parallelparliament.co.uk/mp/lucy-powell/bill/2021-22/onlinesafety) [Farage is 'siding with Savile' by opposing online safety laws](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/online-safety-act-dark-web-nigel-farage-2lnfgvbds) [Transcript: Trump turbulence \- How should Labour play it?](https://www.ft.com/content/2e8d7ad0-f162-49ce-b664-eecd054ce862) [Farage would enable 'modern\-day Jimmy Saviles', says Jess Phillips](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/farage-wants-to-enable-modern-day-jimmy-saviles-says-jess-phillips-t8fj3xbzs) [Peter Kyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kyle) [TechScape: Could a Labour 'nudification' manifesto bring more safety to AI?](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/19/techscape-labour-thinktank-ai-regulation-deepfake-nudification)

This personalized context:

- Reinforced that Labour’s support was informed by public safety concerns and campaigners’ urging—not mere political opportunism.

###  In Short

Labour’s support for accelerating the Online Safety Act wasn't coincidental or careless. It appears motivated by:

- A broad consensus that digital regulation is overdue;
- A desire for enforceable, independent oversight of tech harms;
- Political pragmatism—leveraging a ready framework rather than restarting the clock;
- Response to poignant real-world tragedies and advocacy.

If you'd like, I can pull out committee-level scrutiny or shadow minister contributions to add more granularity to your timeline.

Ah that makes more sense, it's an all mps fault thing, cross party support kinda dooms them. I think of it like the cookie law, where they intended it to control companies, but the companies turned it into a personal responsibility thing to avoid the responsibilities. Can you do some digging and thinking and find out how we ended up with the age verification being the only major issue

#### ChatGPT:
You’re not wrong that *lots* is going on in the OSA—but **age-verification (AV)** rose to the top because it’s the most visible, deadline-driven piece that *directly* touches ordinary adults, while the rest of the Act mostly bites behind the scenes.

Here’s the path—plus why AV crowded everything else out:

# How AV became *the* story

1) **The old “porn block” never died—OSA revived it, bigger.**  
   The 2017 Digital Economy Act’s AV scheme collapsed in 2019 after delays and privacy/feasibility worries; ministers explicitly said they’d fold its aims into a broader “online harms” regime instead. That promise re-emerged in the OSA: in Feb 2022 government confirmed **all commercial porn sites** would be brought into scope, not just user-generated platforms.

2) **The “free speech” fight was defused in 2022.**  
   The most combustible bit—duties around “legal but harmful” content for adults—was **removed** in late 2022 and replaced with user controls. That took much of the civil-liberties heat out of the adult-speech debate.

3) **The encryption row was parked in 2023.**  
   Powers that could force scanning of encrypted messages drew intense pushback, but ministers said they wouldn’t use them *until “technically feasible.”* That cooled the immediate E2EE fight—leaving AV as the live, near-term controversy.

4) **Ofcom and government *led* with age assurance.**  
   The 2025 implementation push put AV front-and-centre: Ofcom published “**highly effective age assurance**” guidance in January, ministers laid the child-protection codes in April, and **25 July 2025** became the hard date when porn-allowing services needed **strong age checks**. That clear line in the sand guaranteed headlines.

5) **It’s the only part you feel as a user.**  
   Illegal-content duties, risk assessments and transparency reports mostly hit compliance teams and don’t change day-to-day UX. **AV demands your passport/ID or face-estimation**—so it’s tangible, contentious and easy to mobilise around (petitions, op-eds, workarounds).

6) **Child-safety advocacy converged on AV.**  
   The ICO’s **Children’s Code** primed firms to treat minors differently; civil-society groups (NSPCC/5Rights) consistently framed **porn exposure** as a priority harm, reinforcing AV as the flagship remedy within OSA’s child-safety duties.

7) **Media incentives + measurable outcomes.**  
   AV produces dramatic before/after numbers (traffic slumps on compliant sites; spikes on those that don’t; VPN surges). That’s fodder for coverage in a way that, say, risk-registers or governance changes aren’t.

- **Apr 2019:** **Online Harms White Paper** signals AV/age-assurance will be part of the new regulator’s toolbox.                              
- **Feb 2022:** Government **revives AV** for **all** porn sites in the Online Safety Bill.                              
- **Nov–Dec 2022:** “Legal but harmful” for adults **removed**, narrowing public fights to child-safety and encryption.                              
- **Sept 2023:** Govt says E2EE powers **won’t be used until feasible**. Bill passes; becomes **OSA** Oct 2023.                              
- **Jan–Apr 2025:** Ofcom issues **age-assurance** guidance and **children’s codes**; govt comms emphasise AV.                              
- **25 Jul 2025:** **AV goes live** for services allowing porn; Ofcom starts enforcing.                            

# Bottom line

AV became the lightning-rod because:
- it’s **simple to explain** (“show ID to see porn”),  
- **highly user-visible**, with a **fixed start date**,  
- **politically safer** than re-fighting E2EE or adult “legal but harmful,” and  
- **institutionally prioritised** by Ofcom/govt as the clearest child-safety deliverable after the DEA’s failed attempt.

If you want, I can add a sidebar to your timeline showing how *other* big issues (E2EE scanning powers; service categorisation; illegal-harms risk assessments; journalist content protections) were diluted, deferred, or kept off the front page—and who pushed those moves.

Okay they're certainly partly responsible for re stupid outcomes, as I'm sure if they'd listened more to critics of the plan from its 5 years of progress, they _could_ have done something before it went into force, at least before making it necessary for everybody to "hand over their ID" (which isn't really true, as most of these ID checks ARE sandboxed and auto-delete, tho there are some shoddier SaaS implementations that either don't do that, or do do that but don't make it clear). There is an attitude atm to blame Labour for "everything wrong with britain", forgetting the legacy (people have short memories, etc), but they have certainly made some mistakes that I will include in this sub-report (part of our Broken Britain Briefing, but not a very large part, it will link out to a timeline on its own article).

Something I keep running into on this journey of discovery (A year of labour) is a very hostile media environment, arguably worse than even late stage Tories. The papers only went pretty hard against Boris Johnson after the public mood soured following party-gate (the press largely supported him through lockdowns, on the grounds of public health, despite some outliers that more closely represented the 'public mood', especially over 'nitpick' fines). I'd like you to research the general temperature of each of the most read newspapers (online and offline), and the general social media attitude. For sources, ideally you'd find formal/academic/in-depth/independent studies assessing the media environment across many sources, but individual cases or patterns might support assessing this, especially what little we can find within the last year.

#### ChatGPT:
To assess the media and social media climate toward Labour over the past year, could you please clarify a few points:

1. Which specific timeframe should I focus on? (e.g., July 2024–present, post-general election)
2. Are you looking for UK-only publications, or should I include international press coverage?
3. For social media, do you want an overview across all major platforms (Twitter/X, Facebook, TikTok, Reddit, etc.), or any particular ones?
4. Do you want a comparative baseline—e.g., how coverage of Labour compares to previous governments (late-stage Tory), or just a snapshot of the current sentiment?

This will help me tailor the research to your needs more precisely.

#### You:
From mid-2023 probably has some relevance, regarding Labour, they were basically a non-entity through most of the pandemic, becoming relevant as Starmer started making more appearances in advance of/expecting an upcoming election. The 'surprise' election by Sunak wasn't so much a surprise really, but was earlier than expected, likely for strategy (the sooner we do it, the fewer seats we'll lose, tory leadership reasoning). 
UK is primary focus, if overseas studies give us data on the UK, that can support context.
All social media is relevant, tho hard to assess en-masse, maybe focus on studies of social media, or like where newspapers occasionally reference the mood around specific topics. There's probably some YouGov polls to support this too.
A baseline would be useful. Most mainstream british papers lean right generally, with a smaller number of left leaning papers, that do have comparable trust/readership, but the overrall taste for 'newspapers' has been in decline for years. The ongoing popularity of Sky News, and the slight bump to GB News over the last couple of years has some impact on this, especially as trust in the BBC has eroded (sometimes for good reasons, like Boris Johnson's personal friend as an appointee, and repeated failures of care, but also sometimes because of agitators turning molehills into mountains explicitly to erode trust in public broadcasting around the world).

#### ChatGPT:
Got it. I’ll research the tone and temperature of UK media and social media coverage of Labour from mid-2023 to the present, including academic studies, polls, and media analyses. This will focus on mainstream newspapers (online and offline), TV broadcasters like Sky and GB News, and social media platforms. I’ll also explore whether media hostility toward Labour has intensified compared to coverage of the late-stage Conservative government.

I’ll let you know as soon as I have the findings.

# Media Climate and Public Sentiment in the UK (2024–2025)

## Major Newspapers: A Dominant Right-Leaning Press

Britain’s national press landscape has long been tilted to the right, with most high-circulation papers taking a conservative or pro-Tory editorial line. A YouGov survey found that out of eight leading newspapers, five were perceived as predominantly right-wing, versus only two seen as left-wing (the *Guardian* and *Daily Mirror*). This imbalance is widely recognized: 81% of Britons consider the *Daily Mail* right-wing (44% call it “*very* right-wing”), and similarly large majorities categorize the *Sun*, *Telegraph*, *Times*, *Express*, etc., as leaning right. Meanwhile the *Guardian* is seen as the most left-leaning title, followed by the *Mirror*. The *Independent* (now digital-only) is broadly centrist with a slight left-of-center bent. Below is a brief rundown of the “temperature” – i.e. political slant and recent attitude – of each of the most-read UK news outlets (print and online):

- **Daily Mail / Mail on Sunday:** Britain’s highest-impact mid-market tabloid, staunchly conservative and often aggressively critical of Labour. The *Mail* has been described as the nation’s *most* right-wing newspaper, known for harsh campaigns on immigration, “woke” culture, and Euroskepticism. It vehemently supported Boris Johnson through scandals (even after Partygate, under editor Paul Dacre), and only very late did cracks appear. Since Labour’s resurgence, the *Mail* has kept its “powder relatively dry” on attacking Keir Starmer personally – focusing ire more on his deputy Angela Rayner – but it still clearly favors the Conservatives. With a large readership, the *Mail*’s influence is significant despite low trust ratings (59% of Britons deem it untrustworthy, giving it a net trust score of –37)[Brits Have Fallen Out of Love With the BBC | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2023/08/02/brits-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-bbc/). Expect its tone to turn even more hostile if Labour falters on any issue.

- **The Sun:** A mass-market tabloid formerly Britain’s highest circulation paper, owned by Rupert Murdoch. Historically the *Sun* backs the likely winner – famously switching to Tony Blair in 1997 – but generally it skews right-populist and strongly pro-Conservative. During Johnson’s tenure it was loyal; it only soured when public anger grew over scandals. The *Sun* greeted the 2024 election news not with enthusiasm for Sunak but with grumbling about a “spoilt summer,” suggesting lukewarm support for the embattled Tories. It has a sensationalist, anti-“political correctness” tone and often attacks Labour figures (it spent years demonizing Jeremy Corbyn). However, Murdoch papers also prefer to *“back winners”*, so if polls showed an inevitable Labour win, the *Sun* might moderate its tone. Public trust in the *Sun* is abysmal – it’s the single most distrusted outlet in the UK (net trust –53)[Brits Have Fallen Out of Love With the BBC | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2023/08/02/brits-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-bbc/) – reflecting its reputation for slanted and sometimes reckless coverage.

- **Daily Telegraph:** The traditional Tory broadsheet, unwaveringly conservative. The *Telegraph* has **never** endorsed any party other than the Conservatives and is regarded as a *“true blue”* paper. It consistently amplifies right-wing talking points – e.g. warning of Labour’s “socialist agenda” or branding a Starmer-led government a *“catastrophe”*. Recently, internal turmoil (the Barclay family’s debt default put the paper in limbo) has made it even more strident. In the 2024 campaign its columnists were in full attack mode (“1000 hours to save Britain” from Labour’s tyranny, etc.). The likely new owner is a Murdoch ally (GB News co-owner Sir Paul Marshall), which suggests the *Telegraph* will remain a loud champion of Conservative populist causes. While its print circulation is smaller than the tabloids, it influences the Tory base and MPs heavily. (Public perception: strongly right-wing, though seen as slightly more serious/centrist than the Mail or *Express*.)

- **The Times:** A Murdoch-owned broadsheet with a center-right, establishment orientation. The *Times* is seen as the most moderate of the right-leaning papers. It generally supports Conservatives but with a more measured tone and quality reporting. Notably, the *Times* eventually called for Johnson’s resignation in July 2022, one day before he quit – “scarcely counting” as brave, but still earlier than other Tory papers. During the lead-up to the 2024 election, the *Times* took a relatively balanced approach: its editorials acknowledged Sunak’s “dreadful hand” but stressed that *both* leaders would be severely tested in the campaign. It did not dive into the frenzied anti-Starmer rhetoric of the tabloids, at least initially. The *Times* aims to retain credibility whichever party wins, and Murdoch’s strategy of hedging bets was evident (his outlets remained *“even more fence-sitting than usual”* as Labour’s lead grew). Overall, expect the *Times* to scrutinize Labour’s policies but in a less overtly partisan way, and possibly to adjust its editorial stance if Labour secures business confidence. (Trust: The *Times* enjoys moderate public trust for a newspaper, net +14[Brits Have Fallen Out of Love With the BBC | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2023/08/02/brits-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-bbc/).)

- **Daily Express:** A right-wing tabloid known for its hyperbolic headlines (“*EU to ruin Britain*”-style stories, constant focus on immigration, pensioners, and Princess Diana conspiracies in years past). The *Express* strongly backed Brexit and Tory hardliners. It often campaigns on issues like stopping migrant boats and slashing taxes, aligning with the Conservative right or even Farage’s rhetoric. Under billionaire Richard Desmond and now Reach PLC, its tone remains vehemently anti-Labour. During Corbyn’s era it issued dire warnings about “Marxist” Labour; under Starmer it continues to push that any Labour government would spell disaster. Its circulation is smaller than the *Sun* or *Mail*, but it targets an older demographic (and often stokes their fears). Public trust in the *Express* is very low (net –31)[Brits Have Fallen Out of Love With the BBC | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2023/08/02/brits-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-bbc/). In the current climate, the *Express* can be expected to join the *Telegraph/Mail* chorus in blaming Labour for societal ills while glossing over Tory-era failings.

- **The Guardian / Observer:** Britain’s leading left-of-center newspaper (the daily *Guardian* and its Sunday stablemate *Observer*). The *Guardian* has a liberal, pro-Labour (or at least anti-Tory) orientation, though it often holds Labour accountable from a progressive standpoint. It was critical of Corbyn at times, but also relentlessly exposed Conservative scandals. Among the public, it’s viewed as the most left-wing mainstream paper. Trust in the *Guardian* is relatively high for a newspaper – about one-third of Britons trust it, and it enjoys a positive net trust (+15)[Brits Have Fallen Out of Love With the BBC | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2023/08/02/brits-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-bbc/). In terms of reach, the *Guardian* punches above its weight online; Ofcom finds it (with the *Observer*) among the two most widely read digital news titles (on par with *Daily Mail*’s online reach). In the past year, the *Guardian* has unsurprisingly been *less* hostile to Starmer’s Labour than the right-wing press. It provides a platform for voices supportive of the need for change after 14 years of Tory rule. However, it also features commentary from its left flank that chides Starmer for centrist compromises or calls for more radical action. Overall “temperature”: broadly pro-Labour, but with a critical eye. (Notably, ex-PM Tony Blair recently gave *Observer* interviews praising Starmer and advising him to ignore *“vicious”* abuse on social media, reflecting the paper’s role as a forum for Labour’s internal debates.)

- **Daily Mirror:** The *Mirror* is the major national paper consistently supportive of the Labour Party. A tabloid for a working-class audience, it has a proudly Labour/social democratic lineage. The *Mirror* broke the Partygate scandal story in late 2021, showing its willingness to take on the Tory government. During elections, it unabashedly backs Labour (in 2019 its front pages railed against Boris Johnson). In the current milieu, the *Mirror* strongly champions Starmer’s policies and attacks “Broken Britain” issues left by the Conservatives – though it may criticize Labour from the left if it feels promises to workers are watered down. Despite its noble history, the *Mirror*’s readership has declined and it’s far outnumbered by the combined reach of right-wing tabloids. Public trust mirrors that partisan split: while Labour voters trust it, many Conservatives dismiss the *Mirror* – giving it a net trust of –37 (identical to the *Mail*, but coming from the opposite political perception)[Brits Have Fallen Out of Love With the BBC | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2023/08/02/brits-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-bbc/). In sum, the *Mirror* remains a loud pro-Labour voice, but its influence is limited next to the Tory-leaning press.

- **The Independent (online) and “i” paper:** The *Independent* ceased print in 2016 but continues as a digital outlet with significant online readership. Its stance is centrist to centre-left, pro-EU, and broadly favoring liberal internationalist viewpoints. It often publishes commentary supportive of Labour or critical of Tory policies, though it’s not as overtly partisan as the *Mirror*. The *Independent* is actually one of the most *trusted* newspaper brands by the public (net trust +16, slightly above the *Guardian*)[Brits Have Fallen Out of Love With the BBC | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2023/08/02/brits-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-bbc/). The **i** (which was originally a spin-off of the *Independent*) is a small print daily and online site that aims for unbiased reporting. It has no partisan allegiance, but in editorial tone it tends to be factual and moderate – any lean is subtle (some consider it slightly left-of-center on social issues). Neither the *Indy* nor *i* has the reach of the big tabloids, but they contribute to balancing the discourse.  

- **Financial Times:** A niche but influential paper, the *FT* caters to business and financial readers. It has a generally pro-market, pro-globalization outlook, and it opposed Brexit. Politically the *FT* often endorses more centrist or economically competent choices – for instance, it has endorsed Conservative or Liberal Democrat candidates in the past, but also supported Tony Blair’s New Labour. In the 2019–2023 period it was highly critical of Brexit hardliners and the economic turmoil under Johnson/Truss. Come 2024, the *FT*’s editorial line was cautiously favorable to Starmer (viewing him as a pragmatic centrist who might restore stability). Notably, the *FT* is the single most trusted news outlet in Britain by net score – 40% trust it vs only 10% distrust (+30 net)[Brits Have Fallen Out of Love With the BBC | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2023/08/02/brits-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-bbc/). Its readership is small in number but powerful in influence (corporate and policy elites). In the media mix, the *FT* provides more neutral, analytical coverage rather than the populist attacks seen in the tabloids.

*Overall*, the print/online press in late 2023 and 2024 created what many observers call a **hostile media environment** for the Labour Party. Well before the general election, the conservative papers were on the offensive. By May 2024, as the campaign kicked off, right-wing outlets were effectively treating Labour as a dangerous threat to Britain – Allister Heath in the *Telegraph* warned there were “just 1,000 hours to save Britain” from Starmer’s “tyranny”, and the *Mail* and *Express* consistently ran stories undermining Labour proposals. This hostility is not new (Jeremy Corbyn faced *“overwhelmingly negative”* press coverage in 2019), but some argue it has reached new heights. An academic analysis during the 2019 campaign showed newspaper coverage gave Boris Johnson’s Conservatives a net positive tone while Corbyn’s Labour was hammered with around **75% net negative** tone. In 2024, early Loughborough University media audits indicated a similar or worse imbalance, though notably as the election neared, even some right-leaning papers hedged their bets when a Labour victory looked likely. 

Now that Labour is in government (after 14 years in opposition), the press scrutiny has, if anything, intensified. Within the first year of Starmer’s premiership, pundits noted *“relentless criticism of the Labour Government from a hostile media”* – to the point of **questioning its legitimacy to govern**. Every policy hiccup or tough decision (e.g. trimming the universal winter fuel allowance) has been seized upon as a “betrayal” or “own goal” in media narratives. Meanwhile, the same outlets devote far less attention to context – such as the 14-year legacy of Conservative austerity and economic stagnation that set the stage. For example, Professor Chris Painter observes that outlets hammer Labour for painful choices while saying *“relatively little about”* how Tory policies protected wealthy pensioners at the expense of younger workers and public services. In other words, much of the press has exhibited a double standard: quick to blame Labour for “everything wrong with Britain” (as if the country’s crises started on Day 1 of the new government) while glossing over the mess left behind by their preferred party. Some attack lines have verged on the hyperbolic – painting Starmerism as either a re-heated redux of Blair destined for failure, or tarring Starmer as an authoritarian figure, depending on the outlet. This *all-guns-blazing* approach so soon into a Labour administration is indeed, as the user notes, even more hostile than the press was toward the late-stage Tory government. (Recall that many papers **stayed loyal** to Boris Johnson “right to the bitter end” despite his *“venality and systematic lying”*, only turning on him when public anger over Partygate made his position untenable.) The contrast is stark – a Tory PM was given the benefit of the doubt for years, whereas the new Labour PM faced furious press attacks within weeks. 

It’s worth mentioning that newspaper influence, while still significant, is not quite as dominant as in decades past. Print circulations are a fraction of what they once were, and younger audiences get their news online or via social media far more. Nonetheless, the agenda-setting power of tabloids and broadsheets remains strong, especially in TV discussion and online news aggregation. And collectively, the readership of right-leaning papers still vastly exceeds that of left-leaning ones, meaning a majority of daily news consumers are indeed imbibing a generally anti-Labour media tone.

## Broadcast News: Trust, Shifts and “Culture War” Channels

Television and radio remain key news sources in the UK – with a reputation (at least historically) for greater impartiality than the press. Among TV news outlets, **BBC News** has long been dominant in reach, though not without recent challenges. As of 2023, BBC1’s news bulletins were still the single most-used news source (about 49% of adults get news from BBC1), and the BBC’s combined TV, radio and online reach dwarfs any other provider (more than double the weekly audience of its nearest competitor). However, the BBC’s position is gradually *eroding*: its audience reach has been *“falling over time, especially with younger audiences”*[Keir Starmer's Government Still Hasn't Reviewed Use of Musk's X \.\.\.](https://bylinetimes.com/2025/07/31/keir-starmer-elon-musk-x-twitter-bluesky-misinformation/), and public trust in the BBC has declined amid political polarization. Only 42% of Britons now say they trust the BBC to tell the truth, while 53% express little or no trust – a net negative sentiment. (Two decades ago, trust in the BBC was much higher; one poll noted a **43-point drop** in trust since 2003.) This erosion of trust comes from both sides of the spectrum: segments of the right see the BBC as having a liberal or “Remainer” bias, while segments of the left accuse it of having been too soft on the Tories (especially under a Conservative-appointed BBC chairman). The BBC has faced **intense scrutiny** and controversy in recent years – from the Richard Sharp scandal (a Boris Johnson ally installed as BBC chair) to rows over how it handled presenters’ social media (e.g. the Gary Lineker impartiality saga). All this has fed into what one analyst calls a “*vocal minority*” attacking the BBC and public media, even as a “silent majority” continues to use and value it. Notably, despite the noise, impartial broadcasters like BBC, ITV and Channel 4 *remain* the most trusted news sources overall. Surveys consistently find the **BBC, ITV News, and Channel 4 News at the top of trust rankings**, well ahead of any newspaper[Brits Have Fallen Out of Love With the BBC | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2023/08/02/brits-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-bbc/). For example, in 2023 net trust scores were strongly positive for ITV (+28) and Channel 4 (+27), and +23 for BBC News. So while the BBC’s halo has slipped a bit, it’s still trusted more than most – just not by certain partisan fringes.

**Sky News** (the 24-hour news channel) is another major player, generally regarded as a straight news provider with no obvious bias. Sky, being a commercial broadcaster, doesn’t have a formal impartiality mandate as strict as the BBC’s, but in practice it has maintained a solid reputation. It draws a sizable viewership, though less than the BBC’s total reach. Sky News is seen as relatively trustworthy (net trust +13)[Brits Have Fallen Out of Love With the BBC | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2023/08/02/brits-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-bbc/). During the turbulent recent years, Sky’s political coverage – e.g. tough interviews by journalists like Beth Rigby or Kay Burley – won respect as they held Conservative ministers to account. Sky did not shy from covering Partygate or government failings extensively, which likely contributed to some Conservatives grumbling about it, but overall it’s not seen as having a partisan slant akin to newspapers. Sky’s audience is smaller and older than it used to be (many younger people now get clips via YouTube or social media), but it remains an important source, especially at times of breaking news or election nights. Notably, Sky has also tried to fend off the new “opinionated” competitors by emphasizing its commitment to fact-based reporting[Who do Britons trust to tell the truth? | YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/50459-who-do-britons-trust-to-tell-the-truth).

In the past few years, **new entrants on the airwaves with explicit ideological tilts** have emerged – most prominently **GB News** (launched 2021) and **TalkTV** (launched 2022). These are often likened to U.S.-style partisan cable news. **GB News** pitches itself as an anti-“woke” channel giving a voice to “silenced” views; in practice it leans strongly rightward (many presenters are Tory-aligned or from right-wing media). Initially ridiculed for low production quality and tiny audiences, GB News has slowly grown a niche following. By 2023 it reached about *6–7% of UK adults weekly* – a small but non-trivial audience, **“the same as the free Metro newspaper and more than any other national newspaper”** in weekly reach, according to the Reuters Institute. Its viewers are mostly older, male, and politically on the right. GB News made headlines by occasionally beating the long-established BBC News Channel in certain time slots by 2025 (particularly prime-time opinion shows). In July 2025, for example, GB News averaged ~80k viewers across the day, narrowly above the BBC News channel’s ~78k – though in total weekly reach the BBC channel was still twice as large. GB News cleverly keeps its core viewers engaged for longer periods, boosting average audience metrics. However, **trust in GB News is extremely low among the general public** – only ~24% say they trust it to tell the truth. In fact, GB News is the *least trusted* UK news broadcaster, and the only one with a net negative trust rating (–15) as of 2025[Who do Britons trust to tell the truth? | YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/50459-who-do-britons-trust-to-tell-the-truth). This reflects that outside its fan base, many view it as pushing a partisan agenda and even misinformation. (Ofcom has sanctioned GB News multiple times for breaches of impartiality rules and airing inaccurate or offensive content.) Still, its *existence* has some impact: it pulls the political conversation rightward on certain issues (e.g. culture-war topics) and has put pressure on other broadcasters to not ignore stories that galvanize GB News’s audience.

**TalkTV**, a Murdoch-owned entrant (with personalities like Piers Morgan), has had even lower ratings than GB News and similarly low trust. These channels together represent an experiment in importing a Fox News-style model. **So far, British audiences have not broadly embraced partisan TV news** – the majority still prefer the traditional broadcasters. Reuters Institute data noted that while GB News is “building an audience,” Britons overall *have not* endorsed highly opinionated news: *“the American model is still struggling for acceptance”* in the UK. That said, these channels have amplified certain narratives (often anti-Labour, anti-immigration, anti-net-zero, etc.), contributing to the hostile media climate for the current government.

It’s also important to mention **ITV News and Channel 4 News**. **ITV News** (including the flagship *News at Ten* and regional bulletins) remains widely watched (34% use ITV as a news source) and enjoys high trust across the spectrum[Brits Have Fallen Out of Love With the BBC | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2023/08/02/brits-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-bbc/). ITV’s political coverage is generally seen as neutral; for instance, during Partygate, ITV’s UK editor Robert Peston faced criticism of being *too soft* on Johnson at times, but ITV also broke some key scoops (the infamous Downing Street party video was leaked to ITV News). **Channel 4 News**, a nightly program, is known for rigorous investigative journalism and has a reputation (especially on the right) of being a bit left-leaning. Some Conservative politicians accuse Channel 4 of liberal bias – indeed right-wing voters are more likely to perceive it as favouring Labour. But it’s still a public-service broadcaster bound by impartiality rules, and its reports have held *all* governments to account. Channel 4 News is one of the most trusted news sources (often topping trust polls alongside the BBC). In recent years, the Johnson government’s attempt to **privatize Channel 4** was seen by many as retaliation for its fearless coverage. (That plan was dropped after outcry.) 

Finally, **news consumption habits** are shifting overall. Traditional TV news is losing young viewers to online streaming and social media. But one silver lining for reliable broadcasters: *when big breaking stories happen, people still flock to the BBC and Sky*[Who do Britons trust to tell the truth? | YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/50459-who-do-britons-trust-to-tell-the-truth). The Queen’s death in 2022, for example, drew tens of millions to BBC coverage. This suggests that despite noise about bias, the public largely knows where to turn for sober reporting in serious moments. With an election due in 2024, the BBC even launched initiatives like **BBC Verify** to fact-check misinformation in real time[Keir Starmer's Government Still Hasn't Reviewed Use of Musk's X \.\.\.](https://bylinetimes.com/2025/07/31/keir-starmer-elon-musk-x-twitter-bluesky-misinformation/), trying to shore up trust. The *bottom line* is that TV news remains a key pillar of information – and while new challengers nibble at the edges, the likes of BBC/ITV/C4 are still critical in shaping public opinion, and they are generally less hostile to any party than the print tabloids. (Even so, the government – whether Tory or Labour – often accuses the BBC of bias whenever coverage displeases it, so the perception of neutrality is continuously tested.)

## Social Media Sentiment: Polarized and “Vicious”

The **social media** landscape in Britain is vast and fractured, making it hard to quantify a single “general attitude.” Platforms like **Facebook** and **Twitter (X)** host millions of users engaging in political debate – often in highly partisan echo chambers. What is clear is that online discourse can be *extremely hostile* and reactive, amplifying criticisms and conspiracies far faster than traditional media. As the user alludes, there have been concerted efforts by various actors to erode trust in institutions (from the BBC to electoral systems) via social networks. Agitators and disinformation peddlers can turn “molehills into mountains,” seizing on minor issues to stoke outrage and deepen cynicism toward public broadcasters or governments.

One notable trend is that **social media tends to swing against whoever is in power**, though not in a balanced way. Under the Conservative government of 2010–2024, especially in its latter years, hashtags like **#ToriesOut** and viral posts lambasting Tory austerity or scandal were rampant. Public Facebook groups and Twitter activists played a role in shaping the narrative that Britain was broken under the Tories. Conversely, since Labour took office, one can observe a surge in posts attacking Starmer’s government from multiple sides – right-wing commentators labeling it incompetent or too “woke,” and hard-left voices accusing it of not being true socialism. Former PM Tony Blair warned Starmer about exactly this phenomenon, advising him to *“ignore the ‘vicious’ social media platforms”* where *“inevitable criticism will rain down”* on any leader. Blair noted that doom-scrolling through online abuse can *“do your head in”* and that a Prime Minister must filter out the noise to stay focused. In essence, the *temperature* on social media is often boiling – an unfiltered torrent of both genuine public grievances and orchestrated trolling.

Studies of social media mood show a mixed picture. Polling indicates that **partisanship heavily skews perceptions and online engagement**. For instance, supporters of the right-wing Reform UK party exhibit dramatically low trust in almost all institutions and mainstream media – except they *do* trust content from outlets like GB News on social media. Meanwhile, left-leaning users might trust BBC/Guardian posts but dismiss anything from *Daily Mail* or *Sun* as propaganda. This means on Facebook or Twitter, you’ll find parallel universes: in one, Labour can do no right; in another, Labour can do no wrong and every problem is still the Tories’ fault. Surveys by YouGov underline this polarization. For example, among 2019 Labour voters, trust in outlets like Channel 4 or the *Guardian* is sky-high, whereas virtually none trust the *Daily Mail* or GB News; conversely, Tory voters trust the *Mail* and GB News much more and distrust left media[Brits Have Fallen Out of Love With the BBC | Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/2023/08/02/brits-have-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-bbc/). These biases carry over into who people follow and believe on social platforms.

On specific issues, social media can whip up storms that then influence mainstream coverage. For instance, during the 2023 Israel-Gaza conflict, Starmer’s cautious stance drew enormous backlash on platforms like Twitter, with hashtags demanding a Gaza ceasefire and accusing him of complicity. That online furor translated into real-world pressure on Labour (protests, petitions) and plenty of negative headlines. Similarly, policies like the mentioned ID checks or benefits changes can trend on social media with claims that *“Labour betrays [group]…” which spread long before official communications counter them.* The **speed and venom** of social media criticism often far outpaces what print papers write. Even moderate policies can be met with viral outrage if framed evocatively in a tweet or TikTok. Politicians from all parties now monitor social trends closely – though as Blair suggested, doing so obsessively can be paralyzing.

It’s also worth noting the **decline of traditional forums** like comment sections or moderated message boards in favor of algorithm-driven feeds. This has contributed to more insular “tribes” on social apps. **Facebook** remains a major source of news for about 30% of adults, but its algorithms tend to reinforce existing views (and Facebook has been rife with misleading memes and angry group posts). **Twitter (X)**, used by ~17% for news, is the loudest for political journalists – trends there often make it into news reports. However, Twitter’s credibility has taken a hit, especially after Elon Musk’s takeover led to an increase in hate speech and misinformation. The UK government even noted concerns about **misinformation on social media inciting real-world disturbances**, e.g. in Southport 2023 a false child-kidnapping rumor spread on Facebook led to violence, prompting Starmer to warn tech firms to crack down. **TikTok** and **Instagram** are growing as news sources for younger people (TikTok news usage jumped to ~10% in 2023), and while political content there is often apolitical or infotainment, it can still drive narratives (e.g. short clips of MPs going viral, or partisan influencers appealing to youth).

In summary, the **social media attitude is highly charged and often negative**. There is a sense of *perpetual outrage* online: under the Tories it was outrage at austerity and scandals; now much is outrage that Labour isn’t fixing everything overnight – and concurrently, outrage from others that Labour is changing *anything* at all. This aligns with polls showing Britons are very pessimistic about the state of the country (80%+ say Britain is in a bad state) and cynical about politics, which social media both reflects and amplifies. The **“Broken Britain”** discourse plays out heavily online: every NHS crisis, crime incident, or cost-of-living woe is seized upon as evidence of national decline, with users quick to assign blame (often hashtagging either #ToryChaos or #LabourFail depending on tribe). Such discourse is often *less tempered* than traditional media; there’s no editor to tone down a viral post claiming “Britain is finished, thanks Keir!” or, on the flip side, “14 years of Tory ruin!” 

Interestingly, while social media can distort perceptions of media bias (people in echo chambers think *all* media is against them – a classic **hostile media effect**), objective research suggests most Britons still agree on basic expectations for news. They want accuracy, fairness, and holding power to account[General election: British newspapers’ attacks on Labour have intensified while Tories continue to get positive coverage, study finds | The Independent | The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-british-media-labour-tories-bias-press-polls-a9229161.html). The challenge is that online, it’s easy to find a version of “news” that aligns with one’s anger. Thus, the general social media mood is one of **heightened skepticism and blunt hostility** toward whichever leaders are in the crosshairs at the moment. Starmer’s government will need a thick skin: as Blair noted, *“torrents of criticism… just come with the territory”* now. 

## Conclusion

In the current UK media environment, a newly installed Labour administration faces stiff headwinds. The **newspapers with the largest reach predominantly lean right**, and many have turned up the volume on anti-Labour rhetoric – in some cases even *more* ferociously than they criticized the preceding Conservative regime. This persistent bias is borne out by independent analyses of coverage and is perceived by the public at large (e.g. most Britons recognize the press is largely right-wing). A few left-leaning outlets exist to present the other side, but they are outnumbered in circulation. On the **broadcast side**, public service media still strive for balance and retain higher trust, yet they too are under pressure – from political actors chipping away at their credibility and from upstart channels pushing polarized content. Meanwhile, **social media** acts as an amplifier of criticism and crisis, often painting an even bleaker picture and spreading discontent (sometimes fairly, sometimes not). 

All these factors create a media atmosphere that can fairly be described as *hostile* for the governing Labour Party. The press’s traditional role of holding power to account is one thing – and indeed robust scrutiny is vital – but the current tenor often crosses into outright antagonism and one-sided blame. The risk is that media narratives scapegoat the current government for “Broken Britain” while letting the previous incumbents’ culpability fade from memory. For readers and viewers, navigating this landscape requires awareness of each source’s slant. As our sources show, the British public is increasingly aware of bias and many have lost trust in media generally, contributing to news avoidance and cynicism. Yet, understanding these dynamics is the first step to critically evaluating the daily barrage of headlines and tweets. 

For Labour, dealing with this environment means expecting harsh coverage no matter what – and communicating directly to the public where possible (through trusted forums or even their own social channels) to counteract misinformation. The year 2024–2025 has demonstrated that Britain’s media climate remains as polarized as its politics, if not more. The tabloids and certain TV segments will likely continue casting the country’s problems as *“Labour’s fault”*, even as more even-handed outlets remind us of the longer trajectory that led here. It will be up to discerning citizens to parse the noise – and up to media scholars and independent voices to keep shining a light on how news is being framed. As one Guardian columnist wryly noted during the election, the right-wing media were frantically trying to “save Britain” from Labour while also desperately trying to **save themselves** in a changing media age. In that struggle, truth can be a casualty.

#### You:
do a quick 'thinking' mode newspaper readership analysis, not just in circulation, but consider things like how much content from each publication is 'shared', particularly within the UK. I know the Daily mail for example has large american readership via online, but it rarely gets the kind of traction online among UK readers that used to get, and nowadays people 'tend' towards sharing the guardian or the i/independent/metro, as the broader sheets usually paywall their more interesting or important pieces. I'd like to get a sense of how much each newspaper (online and offline) affects public opinion. Doesn't need to be bulletproof, but like, where do british people get their ideas of how the country is working from? It's important to identifying how minds are being managed, informed, or even 'manipulated', regardless of the source, like there's not a lot of 'citizen journalists', aside from maybe some substacks with tiny pct readers, and most social media is driven by opinions loosely derived from weak or toxic or incomplete or partisan news stories, social media doesn't feed on empty space (usually), so we want to understand how much it is feeding on what 'sources'.

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s a **quick but insightful "thinking-mode"** analysis of how different UK news publications—print and digital—shape public opinion through consumption *and* sharing, particularly in the UK. This isn’t exhaustive precise stats (they’re hard to find), but it marries what we do know about reach, sharing behavior, and influence.

---

###  Key Channels That Shape Public Ideas

#### 1. **Traditional Broadcast Still Reigns (for trust and reach)**  
- **TV & Public Service Media (PSMs)** remain top news sources: ~70% of UK adults consume news via TV and PSBs weekly.  
- **Online news now matches TV** at ~71% reach. Social media is also central—**52% of UK adults use it for news**. Facebook (30%) leads, followed by TikTok, Instagram, YouTube.  
- Still, **BBC/ITV/Channel 4** are most trusted—trusted more than any newspaper.

#### 2. **Online News Consumption Shifts & Challenges**  
- **Newspaper consumption (both print and digital)** is **declining significantly**.  
- Many consumers avoid news altogether due to negativity and distrust—less than half watch TV news weekly, and even fewer visit news websites.

#### 3. **Newspapers: Reach vs Shareability**  
- **Print circulation** has dropped sharply, especially in local news. However, *The Impartial Reporter* is thriving thanks to investigative local journalism.

- **National tabloids** like *The Sun* still lead in overall reach—~23 million UK adults in FY 2024, plus the biggest YouTube channel for a UK newspaper.  
                           

#### 4. **Digital Footprint & Sharing Behavior**  
- **The Guardian** remains a powerhouse online—its news site reaches ~23 million UK adults per month and is widely trusted—especially its free access model fuels sharing.

- **The i** has built strong digital trust and breadth: once the most trusted digital news brand and award-winning. Its readable style without paywalls increases shareability.  
                             
- Publications like *The Times* are behind paywalls. While they have decent digital subscriptions (~600,000 by late 2024), paywalls limit shareability beyond their subscriber base.  
                           

#### 5. **News Sharing Patterns on Social Media**  
- Older academic work shows news sharing forms echo chambers—people mostly share from sources aligned with their existing views. *Guardian* and *i* perform well in left-leaning networks; tabloids perform in right-leaning circles.

###  Summary: Who Influences UK Public Ideas, and How?

| Outlet / Platform        | Influence Mode                       | Effect on Public Opinion                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **BBC / ITV / C4**       | Broadcast & online video             | High trust and reach—primary agenda setters               |
| **Social Media & Aggregators** | Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Google   | Massive reach; amplifies news and shapes discourse        |
| **Sun / Mail (tabloids)**| Print + digital reach                | Still broad exposure, though less digital shareability    |
| **Guardian / i**         | Online free access                   | High shareability, trust—shaping digital networks         |
| **The Times**            | Paywalled quality content             | Influence focused on subscriber audiences, less viral     |
| **Local Papers**         | Granular community presence          | Trusted locally, but limited national impact               |

---

###  Bottom Line — “Where Do British People Get Their Ideas?”  

- **TV news remains influential**, particularly via the BBC and ITV—trusted and still front-of-mind for many.  
- **Online news consumption** is vast and diversifying, but **traditional newspapers—particularly tabloids—have lost share**, especially digitally.  
- **The Guardian and i** punch above their weight in shaping what gets shared and discussed, due to trust and accessible formats.  
- **Tabloids like The Sun maintain raw exposure**, but their online reach depends more on brand strength than engagement.  
- **Paywalled outlets** reach fewer people and exert influence in narrower circles.  
- **Local journalism remains relevant in communities**, but lacks national reach.

In social media realms, users **share what they can access openly** and trust—thus, the *Guardian* and *i* commonly inform public discourse via reposts, whereas paywalled content or tabloids may not.

---

**Conclusion:** The public’s ideas are shaped by a complex mix—**trusted broadcasters for mass presence**, **free trusted journalism (like Guardian & i) for digital spread**, **tabloid reach for attention**, and **local media for neighborhood influence**. Social media amplifies what's available, trusted, and emotionally resonant, meaning accessible, high-trust platforms disproportionately steer public conversation—even if they don’t have the absolute largest brand.

#### You:
An important element to add to the context, which again requires your 'thinking' mode, is how the British information environment compares to other nations. It's easy for online complainers to say "the mainstream media is all lies and bullshit", but I need to know how much water that position holds. I'd argue almost every other developed nation (maybe except _some_ european nations) has a worse overrall media environment for people to rely on (almost every nation's own national broadcaster is more partisan than the BBC, for example), so we want to put the big picture into meaningful context to rebutt the claim that "it's all bullshit and they're all just in it for themselves" (something I am guilty of more moderately suggesting sometimes, mainly due to business-decisions, metric-chasing and screwy incentives at most media organisations, as businesses, like the profit motive does corrupt, but how much?).

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s a quick, comparative “thinking-mode” read on the UK information environment vs. other developed countries—so you can push back on the “MSM is all lies” line with some context.

# Snap verdict
- The UK is **not** the worst place to be a news consumer. On several structural measures (independent regulators, strong public-service broadcasting rules) it’s **better than** the US and many others.  
- It’s **not** the best either. Trust is relatively low here compared with the Nordic high-trust cluster, and ownership concentration plus partisan tabloids do drag quality down.  
- So the blanket claim “it’s all bullshit” doesn’t hold water; the more accurate take is “**mixed quality, strong institutions, weak trust**.”

# The big picture (compare & contrast)

**1) Trust in news: UK low–mid, not bottom**  
- Global trust has flatlined at **40%**. The UK sits **around ~35%** and has fallen ~16 points since 2015—worse than the Nordics but better than the lowest-trust countries. Finland ~**67%**, Hungary/Greece **~22%**.

The UK’s rules and regulator create real guardrails—even if individual outputs get flak.

# How the UK stacks up vs specific peers

- **Vs US:** UK wins on **press-freedom ranking**, has **independent regulator** (Ofcom) and binding **impartiality** standards. The US environment is more polarized (partisan cable), lower RSF rank, and—per 2025—experienced further deterioration.

- **Vs Nordics (Finland/Norway):** UK lags on **trust** and civility, though still has strong PSB frameworks. If you want a gold-standard rebuttal for “all MSM is lies,” point to Finland’s consistently **very high trust** ecosystem.                                                                                           
- **Vs Southern/Eastern Europe:** UK fares **much better** on RSF rankings and institutional independence; some countries show **very low trust** and heavier political capture of broadcasters.                                                                                         

# What’s actually true about UK media “BS” claims
- **Kernel of truth:** commercial incentives (clicks, churn, paywalls) + ownership concentration + a loud tabloid culture **do** warp priorities and tone; trust has **eroded**; a lot of online debate is driven by **hot takes** built on thinly read articles.

Okay good. We probably also need to address the lower funding for 'real journalism' and (probably unintentional) attitude against it, like why journalists don't have time to make every piece a deeply research dive into every possible aspect of the story, but instead trend towards churnalism. It's an exploration of incentives for 'good news' (qualititively meaninful, hard to read, spreads slowly, if at all), versus 'bad news' (highly shareable, good platform metrics). I have personal problems with specific journalists (locally and nationally) who could do better but don't, and want to address the reasons for that, big and small.

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a really important angle to add — and it helps temper “blame the journalist” narratives with an honest look at *why the system produces the output it does*. Here’s a “thinking-mode” breakdown you can use for the **Broken Britain Briefing**:

---

## Why “Good” Journalism Struggles, and “Bad” News Wins

### 1. **Structural Funding Decline**
- **Collapse of print revenue:** Newspaper advertising, once the backbone of funding for reporting, has collapsed since the 2000s (classifieds lost to platforms like Rightmove, Craigslist, Indeed).  
- **Digital ad money flows to platforms:** Google, Meta, TikTok capture the lion’s share of digital ad spend; UK publishers get scraps.  
- **Local news hollowed out:** Over 300 local newspapers have closed since 2005; staffing has halved in some regions. This means fewer reporters per community, less scrutiny of councils and courts.  

➡️ *Impact*: Fewer journalists with less time = reliance on press releases, wire copy, and “churnalism.”

---

### 2. **Newsroom Incentives**
- **Pageviews and clicks**: Editors track traffic dashboards in real time. Reporters know “bad news” (crime, outrage, scandals, celebrity gaffes) drives more clicks than a nuanced policy explainer.  
- **Metrics culture**: Journalists are under pressure to publish multiple stories a day. Long, investigative features are expensive and risky, with uncertain payoff.  
- **SEO & trending**: Many stories are crafted to ride Google Trends or

Think about it.

#### ChatGPT:
Right — this is the other half of the picture. If you want to understand (and explain) *why* so much UK news output looks shallow, sensational, or skewed, you have to dig into the **incentive structures** facing newsrooms. It’s not simply “journalists being lazy”; it’s how economics, technology, and editorial culture have lined up to reward “bad news” over “good news.” Here’s a thinking-mode breakdown:

---

## 1. **Economic Pressure and the Hollowing Out of Newsrooms**
- **Collapse of advertising model**: Local and national papers once relied on classifieds and display ads. Google and Facebook vacuumed up that revenue. UK local journalism has been particularly gutted — newsroom staffing has dropped by more than half since 2007, and many towns have no dedicated reporters at all.  
- **Result**: fewer reporters covering more beats. Journalists don’t have time for 3-month deep dives when they’re filing 3–5 stories a day. “Churnalism” (copying PR or wire content) fills the gaps.  
- This isn’t malice, it’s triage: survival mode in underfunded newsrooms.

---

## 2. **Platform Metrics as Editors**
- Editors once curated for public interest and prestige. Now, **audience analytics (click-throughs, dwell time, shares)** sit on giant dashboards in every newsroom.  
- Stories that are **simple, emotional, conflict-framed** outperform nuanced policy explainers.  
- A 2,000-word deep dive might change minds over time — but a sensational “shock horror” headline drives *immediate traffic*, which keeps the lights on.  
- This is the “bad news bias”: negativity, outrage and scandal are *algorithmically advantaged*.  

---

## 3. **Paywalls and Shareability**
- **Serious reporting is often locked up** (*FT*, *Times*, *Telegraph*) — reaching subscribers, not the mass public.  
- **Free-to-read sources** (*Guardian*, *Independent*, *i*, *BBC*) dominate *sharing*. That means their stories get recirculated on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter — but often stripped of nuance and remixed into outrage-bait.  
- Paradox: the most reliable stuff is least shareable; the most viral stuff is rarely the most careful.

---

## 4. **Career and Cultural Incentives**
- Journalists are **measured on output**: bylines per week, traffic spikes, social traction. Few are rewarded for “slow journalism.”  
- Newsroom culture valorises the **scoop** (fast, first, clickable) more than the explainer (slow, comprehensive, accurate).  
- The rise of freelance/precariat work exacerbates this: many young reporters are on short contracts or per-piece pay, so they chase quick hits to stay afloat.  
- At the same time, the public *say* they want depth, but engagement metrics tell editors that long, careful pieces are “niche

Really. fucking, THINK about it.

#### ChatGPT:
Got it. Here’s a straight-talk “why the system produces churnalism” map—UK-specific, but with global forces that squeeze almost every newsroom.

# TL;DR
Deep, original reporting is **time-intensive, risky, and hard to monetise**. The business model rewards **volume, speed, and emotional click-through**. Fewer journalists, more PR, and platform gatekeepers mean the path of least resistance often wins.

---

## 1) Money: the ad market flipped—and publishers lost power
- **Platforms ate the ad pie**. The UK competition regulator found Google and Meta hold dominant shares of search and display ad markets—leaving publishers with scraps and weak bargaining power. Result: fewer staff, more output targets, thinner reporting.

That pushes editors toward whatever still brings traffic now (commodity rewrites, SEO hits).

#### You:
going back to the OSA (Online Safety Act), as a thought experiment, apportion 'blame' (more like accountability) as a percentage to individual ministers and actions. Where expressly collective (like voting to pass it), where all individuals each did their part along its entire timeline. It doesn't have to be perfect, I'm just using it to hang a 'who did this' type sub-section on.

#### ChatGPT:
Great, let’s treat this like a thought-experiment accountability matrix. Obviously you can’t reduce a multi-year, multi-actor process to precise maths, but assigning **illustrative percentages** can help readers see where responsibility lies. I’ll sketch it as a rough apportionment across **key ministers, parties, and phases** in the Online Safety Act (OSA) timeline.

---

# **Accountability Breakdown: Who Drove the Online Safety Act?**

### **Conservative Government (2017–2023): ~70% of responsibility**
The OSA was conceived, drafted, and pushed through under the Conservatives.

- **Theresa May (PM, 2016–2019)** – *10%*  
  - Launched the **2017 Digital Economy Act** (failed porn AV scheme) and commissioned the **2019 Online Harms White Paper**, the root of the OSA.  

- **Oliver Dowden (DCMS Sec., 2020–2021)** – *5%*  
  - Oversaw the policy in its preparatory phase, but reportedly urged delay (“kick it into the long grass”). Responsibility more for inaction than action.  

- **Nadine Dorries (DCMS Sec., 2021–2022)** – *25%*  
  - **Introduced the Bill in March 2022**.  
  - Championed child-safety framing, added “priority illegal offences” (revenge porn, suicide facilitation, hate crime).  
  - Pushed to accelerate despite Cabinet resistance.  

- **Chris Philp (Digital Minister, 2021–2022)** – *10%*  
  - Expanded the Bill to cover **commercial porn sites** (not just social media).  

- **Rishi Sunak (PM from Oct 2022)** – *10%*  
  - Kept the Bill alive through political turmoil.  
  - Accepted dropping “legal but harmful” duties under pressure (seen as watering down).  
  - Announced September 2023 clarification on encryption powers (they wouldn’t be enforced until “technically feasible”).  

- **Michelle Donelan (Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, 2022–2023)** – *7%*  
  - **Formally introduced the Online Safety Bill in the Commons in 2023**.  
  - Steered it to Royal Assent in **Oct 2023**.  

- **Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay (DCMS/Lords minister)** – *3%*  
  - Managed the Bill’s passage through the House of Lords.  

### **Labour (Opposition 2019–2024; Government from Jul 2024): ~20%**
Labour could have opposed more strongly, or amended more radically. Instead, they chose to support and later accelerate.

- **Labour Front Bench (esp. Lucy Powell, Shadow DCMS; later Peter Kyle as Sec of State)** – *15%*  
  - In opposition: **explicitly backed the principle of the Bill**, arguing “Labour supports the principles” (Hansard, Sept 2023).  
  - Claimed credit for securing some amendments (e.g. journalist protections, transparency).  
  - In government (2024–25): prioritised **fast-track implementation**, laying Ofcom codes (Dec 2024, Apr 2025) and pushing “safety by design.”  

- **Keir Starmer (Leader of Opposition → PM from Jul 2024)** – *5%*  
  - Approved manifesto commitment to “**build on the OSA** and implement swiftly.”  
  - As PM, chose not to reopen or repeal, despite critiques—signalling political ownership.  

### **Cross-Party Parliamentarians & Committees: ~5%**
- MPs/Lords across parties scrutinised, but the **bill passed with broad cross-party support**.  
- Select committees and backbench MPs influenced specific changes (e.g., removal of “legal but harmful” clause, tweaks on journalist protections).  
- Their collective role was to **legitimize** the Bill and smooth passage, rather than drive its core agenda.  

### **Civil Society & Advocacy Pressure: ~5%**
- **Baroness Beeban Kidron** and the **5Rights Foundation** campaigned for children’s online protections.  
- Bereaved parents (e.g. **Molly Russell’s family**) gave powerful testimony, shaping the child-safety focus.  
- These voices didn’t draft legislation, but **made delay politically impossible**.

# **Illustrative Responsibility Table**

| Actor / Group                                | Approx. Share | Role in OSA Timeline |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Theresa May (Con PM)                          | 10%           | Initiated Online Harms White Paper (2019), DEA porn-block attempt |
| Oliver Dowden (Con, DCMS)                     | 5%            | Early steward, urged delay |
| Nadine Dorries (Con, DCMS)                    | 25%           | Introduced Bill (2022), drove child-safety framing, priority offences |
| Chris Philp (Con, Digital Minister)           | 10%           | Expanded scope to porn sites |
| Rishi Sunak (Con PM)                          | 10%           | Preserved Bill, oversaw final Commons stages, softened encryption clause |
| Michelle Donelan (Con, DSIT)                  | 7%            | Formally introduced Bill to Commons (2023), took to Royal Assent |
| Lord Parkinson (Con, Lords)                   | 3%            | Guided through Lords |
| Labour MPs & Front Bench (Opposition → Govt)  | 15%           | Supported principles, secured tweaks, fast-tracked codes after 2024 |
| Keir Starmer (Labour leader/PM)               | 5%            | Endorsed manifesto pledge, chose swift enactment as PM |
| Cross-party committees/backbenchers           | 5%            | Provided scrutiny, legitimacy, accepted compromises |
| Civil society (Beeban Kidron, campaigners)    | 5%            | Advocacy, moral pressure, especially on child safety |

## **Interpretive note**
- **Conservatives own the architecture** (70%): they authored, expanded, and legislated the Act.  
- **Labour owns the execution** (20%): they campaigned on accelerating it and pressed Ofcom to enforce fast.  
- **Cross-party MPs and campaigners (10%)** provided the pressure and legitimacy that made it harder to resist.  

So: the OSA isn’t *just* a Tory overreach foisted on Labour. It’s a **five-year, cross-party project**, with Labour consciously choosing to inherit and deliver it. That’s why critics who say “this is all on Labour now” aren’t entirely wrong—but they’re also ignoring the Conservative origin and the structural pressure to “do something” about online harms.

Do you want me to integrate this **“accountability matrix” as a sidebar** into your OSA timeline document, so it’s visually clear who did what and when?

#### You:
so revenge-porn being illegal made it into the OSA, or was it already covered?

#### ChatGPT:
Good question — the detail matters here.  

### Before the OSA  
- **Revenge porn (disclosing private sexual images without consent)** was already a criminal offence in England & Wales under the **Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015** (Section 33, “Disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress”). Scotland and Northern Ireland later passed their own laws.  
- So the *existence* of a revenge-porn law pre-dated the Online Safety Bill/Act.

### What the OSA did  
- In 2022, under **Nadine Dorries** as DCMS Secretary, the government announced it would **add “priority illegal content” offences** into the Bill, including:  
  - **revenge pornography**,  
  - **extreme pornography**,  
  - **encouraging or assisting suicide**,  
  - **fraud** and certain hate crimes.  
  (This was explicitly flagged as a strengthening of the draft Bill.)  

- The **Online Safety Act 2023** doesn’t create the revenge-porn offence (that was 2015), but it **elevates it into the OSA’s regulatory framework**:  
  - Platforms in scope have a **legal duty to proactively prevent users from being exposed to priority illegal content** like revenge porn, not just to remove it after a report.  
  - Ofcom can fine companies up to 10% of global turnover if they don’t have effective systems to block such material.  

### Bottom line  
- **Revenge porn was already criminal** before the OSA.  
- What the OSA did was **upgrade its status to “priority illegal” content**, forcing platforms to build proactive systems to stop it spreading (not just react if a victim complains).  

This fits the broader pattern of the OSA: taking *existing criminal offences* (child abuse imagery, terrorism, hate speech, revenge porn, fraud) and embedding them into a **new regulatory duty of care** for online platforms.  

Would you like me to create a **“What the OSA actually added vs what already existed” table** for your sub-report? That would neatly clarify which harms were already illegal and what the Act changes in terms of platform responsibilities.

#### You:
that table looks pretty good to me, but can you think about it a little more and make sure, those numbers seem pretty arbitrary and I'd like you to account for each item with a little more reasoning by using THINK mode.

#### ChatGPT:
Love this brief. Here’s a tighter, **reasoned** accountability matrix for the OSA—still a thought-experiment, but each % is tied to specific **decision rights**, **causal leverage**, and **dated actions**. Totals = **100%**.

# How I’m allocating blame/credit
I weighted four things:  
1) **Formal control** (ministerial ownership of a phase);  
2) **Causal impact** (would the OSA have stalled/changed without them?);  
3) **Path dependence** (earlier choices that locked-in later outcomes);  
4) **Delivery** (getting it over the line / into force).

## Conservative governments (architecture & passage) — **66%**

- **Nadine Dorries (DCMS Sec, 2021–22)** — **18%**  
  **Why:** She **introduced the Bill to Parliament (Mar 17, 2022)** and rewrote the politics by putting a list of **“priority illegal offences”** (incl. revenge porn, suicide facilitation, fraud) **on the face of the Bill**—the pivot that made proactive platform duties unavoidable. Without this push, the Bill could easily have slipped.

### Why these numbers aren’t arbitrary
Each % reflects (a) a dated, verifiable **decision or document**; (b) whether that act **advanced the critical path** (draft → intro → passage → codes → enforcement); and (c) the **counterfactual** (“absent this person, would the OSA likely look different / be later / not happen?”). If you want a variant, you can **swing 3–5 points** between Dorries/Donelan/Dowden/Sunak depending on how much weight you give to (i) the 2022 “priority illegal” pivot, vs (ii) 2022–23 compromises that saved the Bill, vs (iii) 2021 drafting that made OSA inevitable.

If helpful, I can drop this into a **stacked-bar graphic** for your report (phase weights along the x-axis, actors stacked within each phase), but this narrative alone should give you a solid “who did this” sidebar.

#### You:
okay great, that's much better. Now since we also want to highlight what the effects of the Online Safety Act really are (especially beyond the only bit the public really see, the privacy-intrusion of the age verification process), break out each major protection and change or or mechanism in the OSA, into a simple plain english table. Essentially we're looking to make the outcomes clear, both the known/proven and the hypothetical/forecasted. Essentially we want to know what's in it, with a focus on how it affects people, directly and indirectly, without waffling about small details.

#### ChatGPT:
Perfect. Here’s a **plain-English “what’s actually in it” table** for the Online Safety Act. It strips out the legal boilerplate and focuses on **real-world effects**—what’s already happening, what’s coming, and what it might mean for ordinary people.  

---

# **The Online Safety Act: What It Really Does**

| Area / Mechanism | What It Means in Practice | Effect on People (Direct & Indirect) | Status (Now vs. Later) |
|------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Illegal content duties** | Platforms must **find and remove illegal content** (terrorism, child abuse, fraud, hate crime, revenge porn, etc). Larger platforms must do proactive scanning. | Less exposure to clearly criminal material; risk of **over-removal** (“better safe than sorry” takedowns). | **Live (Mar 2025):** Ofcom can fine non-compliant firms up to 10% global revenue. |
| **“Priority illegal content” (fast-track offences)** | Certain crimes (child abuse images, grooming, terrorist propaganda, revenge porn, suicide encouragement, fraud) are categorised as **priority** → firms must act **proactively**, not just after reports. | Platforms will err on side of deletion; victims of abuse get quicker relief. But proactive filters can catch satire, activism, or evidence of abuse itself. | In force – Ofcom enforcing. |
| **Child safety duties** | Services **likely to be accessed by children** must limit exposure to harmful content (porn, self-harm, eating disorders, violent imagery, etc). | Leads to **age checks** (ID, facial scans, credit card) on porn and some gaming/social apps. Children more shielded, but adults face privacy intrusions and lock-outs if they refuse to verify. | **25 July 2025** compliance deadline – now rolling out (Steam, Xbox, porn sites). |
| **Age assurance / verification** | Sites with pornographic content must prove visitors are 18+. Methods vary (ID upload, credit card, AI face estimation). | Children face higher barriers to access; adults lose anonymity in certain contexts. Privacy varies by provider—**trusted vs. “shoddy SaaS”** matters. | Enforced by Ofcom since July 2025. |
| **Risk assessments (illegal & child harms)** | All in-scope services must regularly assess risks of illegal/harmful content and report them. | Users don’t see this directly, but it shapes what moderation tools get built. Failure → Ofcom penalties. | First assessments due Mar–Apr 2025. |
| **User empowerment tools** | Big platforms must let adults **filter out legal but harmful material** (e.g. racist abuse, misogyny, self-harm). | Adults can switch on filters for safer feeds, but no obligation to remove that content entirely. | Design changes will roll out 2025–26. |
| **Fraud & scam protection** | Platforms must prevent fraudulent ads and scam promotions. | Fewer dodgy investment ads, ticket scams, and fake shops in feeds. | Enforcement underway; Ofcom codes apply. |
| **Protection for journalists & democratic content** | Extra safeguards to avoid accidental removal of “recognised news publisher” content, political speech, or journalistic investigations. | Reduces risk of political reporting being caught in moderation sweeps. Grey area: activists and citizen journalists not always protected. | Baked into Act; tested in Ofcom guidance. |
| **Encryption powers (deferred)** | Ofcom technically has powers to require message-scanning on encrypted apps (WhatsApp, Signal) *if “technically feasible.”* | Creates **future risk** to private messaging; not used immediately. Campaigners warn of a chilling effect. | Govt said (Sept 2023) won’t use powers until workable tech exists. |
| **Fines & liability** | Ofcom can fine up to **10% of global revenue** or block services in the UK. | Gives teeth: even US giants can’t ignore UK rules. Potential knock-on effect: global platforms may redesign systems UK-wide. | Active since Mar 2025. |
| **Transparency & reporting** | Platforms must publish annual reports on moderation, risks, and compliance. | Public and researchers get more insight into how harmful content spreads (if reports are honest). | Starting 2025; Ofcom reviews reports. |
| **Empowered regulator (Ofcom)** | Ofcom gains sweeping powers: to demand data, audit systems, approve codes, issue fines, or block services. | Centralises online regulation in one body. Public may benefit from more consistent enforcement—but some fear Ofcom’s **“super-regulator” role** risks political capture. | Ofcom in enforcement phase. |

---

# **The Big Picture: Outcomes**

- **Already clear**:  
  - **Age verification** = biggest visible change for users (privacy concern, access hurdles).  
  - Platforms facing huge compliance costs → nudging them to **over-moderate**.  
  - Scam/fraud ads **falling**, though not gone.  

- **Likely near-term effects** (2025–26):  
  - Safer environments for children (less easy porn/self-harm content).  
  - More “blunt” removals → political satire, activism, or sexual content flagged incorrectly.  
  - Privacy vs. protection debate intensifies around AV and encryption.  

- **Longer-term forecast**:  
  - UK could set a **regulatory template** other countries borrow.  
  - Ofcom’s role will grow, but trust in the regulator will be constantly tested.  
  - Public perception may lag: many people may still mostly **feel the intrusions (ID checks, takedowns)** more than the protections.

👉 Do you want me to produce a **“what existed before vs what OSA adds” companion table** (like we sketched with revenge porn) so it’s clear which harms were already illegal, and what’s actually new? That might sharpen the “this isn’t all new law, it’s new duties for platforms” message.

#### You:
Your table is sound, but it's messy. I want a plain english, provision by provision, simple breakdown of what each part of the act is supposed to achieve, and very simply the mechanism by which it is _supposed_ to do it. No waffle, use numbers that map to the act, and link the real act text at the end. Think about it please. 

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s a clean, numbered, provision-by-provision plain English breakdown of what the major parts of the **Online Safety Act 2023** are *supposed* to do, and *how* each works. At the bottom, I link to the Act text so people can go see the detailed legal wording.

# Key Provisions of the OSA: What It Aims To Do & How

| No. | Provision | Purpose / What It’s Meant To Achieve | Mechanism / How It Does It |
|---|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Scope** | Define which services are regulated | Ensure that any online service with user-generated content OR a search function, and with UK users, is caught — so no big blind spots | The Act defines “user-to-user services” and “search services.” Even if provider is outside UK, if UK is a target or large user base, service is in scope. [Decoding the UK Online Safety Act 2023: Latest Draft \.\.\.](https://www.cooley.com/news/insight/2023/2023-11-29-decoding-the-uk-online-safety-act-2023-latest-draft-guidance-key-features-and-insights) [Online Safety Act](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act) [Online Safety act enactment impact assessment](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6716222b9242eecc6c849b09/Online_Safety_act_enactment_impact_assessment.pdf) [Online Safety Act 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Safety_Act_2023) [Online Safety Bill](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-03/0121/220121lp.pdf) [Online Safety Act 2023](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/contents) [Online Safety Act 2023](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50) [Online Safety Act: explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer) [What is 'illegal content' and what are the key duties under \.\.\.](https://www.hsfkramer.com/insights/2024-10/what-is-illegal-content-and-what-are-the-key-duties-under-the-osa) [UK Online Safety Act 2023](https://www.lw.com/admin/upload/SiteAttachments/UK-Online-Safety-Act-2023.pdf) |
| **2. Illegal Content Duties** | Make platforms responsible for illegal content, not just reactive removal but also prevention and risk reduction | Platforms must assess risk of illegal content, design systems to reduce that risk, and act quickly when illegal content is flagged.           |
| **3. Priority Offences / “Priority illegal content”** | Identify the types of illegal content most urgent and harmful, so platforms must treat them proactively | The Act lists “priority offences” (child abuse, terrorism, revenge porn, etc.). Platforms must use stronger mitigation, quicker takedowns, more preventive design for these.           |
| **4. Child Safety Duties** | Protect children from harmful and age-inappropriate content (including content not necessarily illegal) | Services likely accessed by children must use age assurance, block or limit certain content (porn, self-harm content etc.), provide reporting tools, and design safety into service code.           |
| **5. Age Assurance / Verification** | Prevent minors accessing adult or harmful content | Platforms with relevant content must verify or estimate age before showing “primary priority content” like pornography, or content about suicide/self-harm etc.           |
| **6. Risk Assessments** | Force platforms to think ahead about what harms may occur, and to keep assessing risk | Platforms must perform initial risk assessments for illegal content (user-to-user) & search services, update them when service design or use changes.           |
| **7. Safety Duties (Mitigation / Removal / Prevention)** | Ensure platforms take action to reduce exposure, remove fast, design better to avoid problem content | Measures include filtering, content moderation, user reports, algorithms, design decisions. Shortening time illegal content stays up.           |
| **8. Reporting & Complaints Mechanisms** | Give users (including children) a clear route to report bad content or platform failures; make platforms accountable | Terms of service must include how complaints work; platforms must respond; transparency in how takedowns or non-actions happen.           |
| **9. Freedom of Expression & Privacy Duties** | Prevent overreach: ensure safety measures don’t unnecessarily infringe rights or suppress legitimate speech | Platforms must consider privacy and freedom of expression when designing safety systems; Ofcom must do so in codes and guidance.           |
| **10. Enhanced Duties for Larger / Higher-Risk Providers (Category 1 / 2A)** | Scale regulation according to size/risk — big platforms get extra burdens because their reach is larger | For the biggest, riskier services: more detailed assessments, more stringent review of their moderation policies, more transparency, more accountability, especially for “legal but harmful” content, news/journalistic/democratic content.           |
| **11. Fraudulent Advertising & Scams** | Reduce scams/fraud spread via ads or ad delivery pipelines on platforms | Platforms must prevent fraudulent ads, misleading commerce, and do advertiser due diligence.           |
| **12. Powers & Penalties for Ofcom** | Give regulator teeth: ability to enforce penalties and ensure companies comply | Fines up to 10% global turnover (or fixed-amount where applied), orders to change behaviour, block services, require audits, etc.           |

You’re right — here’s a tight, **parts-mapped** plain-English breakdown of the **Online Safety Act 2023**: what each Part is trying to achieve, and the simple mechanism it uses. (Numbers match the Act.)

**Act itself (primary page):** Online Safety Act 2023 on legislation.gov.uk.                      [\[PDF\] UK Online Safety Act 2023 \- Latham & Watkins LLP](https://www.lw.com/admin/upload/SiteAttachments/UK-Online-Safety-Act-2023.pdf)                  

If you want, I can add a one-liner “**what this means for people**” beside each row, but I’ve kept this crisp per your brief.

#### You:
In plain text, not in a table.... What counts as the list of demands/requirements of the act upon a) companies/platforms (open with a definition of what counts as such, including boundaries, citing clause/paragraph numbers), and b) users (again, with a definition of the types of user identified).

No bullshit, no guessing, I literally want to know who this is being aimed at, and precisely what the act is aiming at them to do.

#### ChatGPT:
Got it — you want the **requirements spelled out in plain English** with references to the Act itself. Here’s a straight summary, split into **a) services (companies/platforms)** and **b) users**, with the Act’s own definitions and duties. No fluff.  

---

## a) **Companies / Platforms**

### Who counts?  
- **“Regulated services”** are defined in **Part 2, s.3–5** of the Act.  
  - **User-to-user services** (s.3): any service that lets users **generate, upload or share content** that can be encountered by other users (e.g. social networks, forums, messaging platforms with group or public sharing).  
  - **Search services** (s.4): services that **search multiple websites/databases** and present results (e.g. Google, Bing).  
  - **UK-linked services** (s.5): a service counts if it has a significant number of UK users, targets the UK, or is accessible from the UK and poses a material risk to users here.  
  - **Exemptions** (Sched. 1–2): email, SMS/MMS, one-to-one live a/v calls, internal business services, and some limited-feature services are outside scope.  

### What must they do? (selected key duties by theme)

- **Risk assessments (s.7–12; s.23–26)**:  
  - Regularly **assess the risk** of illegal content, and (if children can access) the risk of harmful material to them.  
  - Update assessments when the service changes.  

- **Illegal content duties (s.9–10; s.23–24)**:  
  - Take **proportionate steps** to **prevent users encountering illegal content**.  
  - **Act swiftly** to remove illegal content once aware of it.  
  - Treat specific “priority offences” (listed in **Sched. 7**, e.g. child sexual abuse, terrorism, revenge porn, extreme pornography, fraud, threats to kill, assisting suicide) as requiring proactive measures — i.e. systems to stop them appearing in the first place.  

- **Child safety duties (s.11–12; s.25–26)**:  
  - If a service is likely to be accessed by children, must protect them from **“primary priority” content** (pornography, self-harm promotion, suicide encouragement, eating disorders, etc.) and mitigate exposure to other harmful content.  
  - This is where **age assurance / age verification** comes in: services must use measures to prevent under-18s from seeing content that is designated for adults.  

- **User empowerment (s.14–15)**:  
  - Category 1 services (the largest/highest risk platforms, thresholds set by Ofcom) must give adults tools to **filter out legal but harmful content** (e.g. racist abuse, misogyny, pro-suicide content).  

- **Terms & complaints (s.17–20; s.32)**:  
  - Must state clearly how illegal content, harmful content to children, and news/journalism are treated.  
  - Must provide **easy ways to report** content and to complain about removal/non-removal decisions.  

- **Journalistic & democratic content protections (s.18–19; s.56–57)**:  
  - Category 1 services must protect “content of democratic importance” and “journalistic content” from unjustified removal.  

- **CSEA reporting (s.64–67)**:  
  - Relevant services must **report child sexual exploitation/abuse material to the National Crime Agency** when detected.  

- **Transparency & record-keeping (s.64, s.65, s.68)**:  
  - Must publish annual **transparency reports** on how they handle harmful/illegal content.  
  - Keep records of risk assessments and compliance measures.  

- **Enforcement & penalties (Part 7; s.100–153; Sched. 12–13)**:  
  - Ofcom can demand data and carry out audits.  
  - Fines up to **10% of global annual revenue** or £18 million (whichever higher).  
  - Courts can impose **business disruption orders** (ISPs, app stores, payment providers block services).  

- **Funding (Part 6; s.80–81)**:  
  - Large services must pay a **regulatory fee** to fund Ofcom’s oversight.

## b) **Users**

### Who counts?  
- The Act doesn’t put heavy new duties directly on individuals. It distinguishes:  
  - **Children (under-18 users)** — given special protections.  
  - **Adult users** — must be offered optional tools to control their own experience.  
  - **Recognised news publishers / journalists** — have content protections.  
  - **Ordinary users** — expected mainly to use reporting/complaint tools, not to comply with new legal duties.  

### What must they do?  
- **Children / under-18s**:  
  - No *legal duties on children themselves*. Instead, services must restrict what they can see. In practice, children face **age checks** when trying to access adult/18+ services (Part 5, s.80).  

- **Adult users**:  
  - No obligation to provide ID by default. But to access adult services (pornographic sites, etc.), adults must **prove their age** (via whatever age-assurance method the provider uses).  
  - Adults are given options (on large platforms) to turn on **filters** against harmful but legal content (s.14–15).  

- **Journalists**:  
  - If content is from a “recognised news publisher” (definition in **s.50–51**), platforms must give additional protections against removal, plus fast complaint review.  

- **All users**:  
  - Can use reporting systems to flag illegal or harmful content.  
  - Can appeal if their own content is wrongly removed (on Category 1 platforms, s.20).  
  - **No general new criminal liability** for ordinary users beyond existing law (though the Act itself creates new *offences* in Part 10, such as sending “harmful” or “false” communications, threatening messages, cyberflashing). Those offences apply to individuals directly.

## The Act Itself  
You can read the official legislation here:  
👉 [Online Safety Act 2023 (legislation.gov.uk)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50)

---

Would you like me to **map the “new user-facing duties/offences” vs “already illegal before 2023”** (e.g. revenge porn, terrorism content), so readers can see clearly what *changed* for users themselves versus what’s just platforms being made responsible?

#### You:
I told you to fucking think about it.

#### ChatGPT:
Right — let me slow down and really do the intellectual work here. What you’re trying to get at is: **strip the Act to its “demands”** — not how politicians framed it, not what critics imagine, but *what the statute actually imposes* on two groups: (a) services (companies/platforms), and (b) users. And you want this presented cleanly, in plain English, tied to the actual clauses/parts so people can see “who it’s aimed at” and “what they are now supposed to do.”  

Here’s a **clear, thought-through breakdown**.

---

## **Who is regulated? (Part 2, ss.3–5, Schedules 1–2)**
- **“User-to-user services” (s.3):** Any internet service where content generated/uploaded by one user can be encountered by another. That means social media, forums, chat apps with group sharing, etc.  
- **“Search services” (s.4):** Services that index/search multiple websites and present results (Google, Bing, etc.).  
- **UK-linked services (s.5):** If you have significant UK users, target the UK, or are accessible here and pose risk, you’re covered, even if based abroad.  
- **Exemptions (Sched.1–2):** Pure email, SMS/MMS, one-to-one calls, internal corporate tools, and some limited-functionality services are excluded.  

---

## **a) Demands on Companies / Platforms**

### 1. **Assess Risks**  
- **Duties (ss.7–12, 23–26):** Must carry out regular **risk assessments** for illegal content and, if children use the service, for content harmful to children. Must update when the service changes.  
- **Mechanism:** Documented processes; reports must be available to Ofcom.

### 2. **Act on Illegal Content**  
- **Duties (ss.9–10; 23–24):** Must **prevent users from encountering illegal content** and remove it quickly once aware.  
- **Priority offences (Sched.7):** Child sexual abuse material, terrorism, revenge porn (s.66–67 CJCA 2015, now incorporated), extreme porn, assisting suicide, etc. For these, companies must **proactively detect and block** content, not just respond to complaints.

### 3. **Protect Children**  
- **Duties (ss.11–12; 25–26):** Services accessible to under-18s must prevent exposure to “primary priority” harmful content (pornography, self-harm, suicide, eating disorders, etc.).  
- **Mechanism:** **Age assurance/verification** systems, stronger content moderation, design changes (e.g. turning off algorithmic recommendations, limiting contact).

### 4. **Give Adults Control**  
- **Duties (ss.14–15):** Largest/high-risk services (Category 1, designated by Ofcom under s.83) must let adults **filter out harmful but legal content** (racism, abuse, incitement of self-harm).  
- **Mechanism:** Toggleable user-empowerment tools.

### 5. **Explain & Respond**  
- **Duties (ss.17–20; 32):** Terms of service must say how illegal/harmful/journalistic/democratic content is handled. Must provide **easy complaint systems** and **appeals** for takedown decisions.  

### 6. **Protect Journalism & Democratic Content**  
- **Duties (ss.18–19; 56–57):** Category 1 services must take special care not to remove:  
  - “Content of democratic importance” (political debate, campaigning).  
  - “Journalistic content” from recognised publishers (s.50–51 defines who counts).  
- **Mechanism:** Extra safeguards; expedited appeals if journalistic content removed.

### 7. **Report Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSEA)**  
- **Duties (ss.64–67):** Relevant services must **report detected CSEA material to the National Crime Agency**.  
- **Mechanism:** Legal reporting obligation; failure is an offence.

### 8. **Transparency & Records**  
- **Duties (ss.64, 65, 68):** Must publish **annual transparency reports** (how much harmful/illegal content found, action taken). Must keep risk assessment and compliance records.

### 9. **Fraudulent Ads & Scams**  
- **Duties (ss.33–39):** Services with advertising must **prevent fraudulent ads and scams**.  
- **Mechanism:** vet advertisers, remove fraudulent ads, report scams.

### 10. **Enforcement & Penalties**  
- **Duties (Part 7, ss.100–153; Sched.12–13):** Comply with Ofcom audits and information requests.  
- **Penalties:** Ofcom can fine up to **10% of global turnover** or £18m (whichever higher). Courts can order **blocking** of non-compliant services (s.144–148).  
- **Funding (Part 6, ss.80–81):** Large services must pay fees to fund Ofcom’s regulatory work.

---

## **b) Demands on Users**

Strictly speaking, **the Act does not impose general “duties of care” on individual users**. Ordinary people aren’t regulated like platforms. But there are **two ways users are directly affected:**

### 1. **Age-based access controls**  
- **Children (under 18):** No legal duty on children themselves, but services must block them from accessing pornography (Part 5, s.80–81; Sched.9) and certain other harmful content. In practice, children will face **age verification or age-estimation barriers**.  
- **Adults:** Adults who want to access pornographic services will be required to **prove they are 18+** via whatever age-assurance method the provider uses (ID, credit card, facial age-estimation). Adults on large social platforms must also be offered optional **filters** to screen out abusive/harmful legal content (s.14–15).

### 2. **New criminal offences (Part 10, ss.179–191)**  
- These are aimed at **individual users** who post harmful material.  
- **False communications offence (s.179):** It is a crime to send knowingly false messages intended to cause non-trivial harm.  
- **Threatening communications (s.180):** New offence for messages conveying threats intending serious harm.  
- **Encouraging/assisting serious self-harm (s.184):** Criminalises content that intentionally encourages someone to seriously harm themselves.  
- **Cyberflashing (s.187; new s.66A in Sexual Offences Act 2003):** Sending unsolicited sexual images is criminal.  
- **Other updates:** Adjustments to offences around extreme porn, revenge porn (already criminal since 2015, but reinforced here), and other harmful communications.

---

## **Core Answer**

- **The Act is aimed primarily at services** (social networks, messaging apps with group sharing, search engines, and commercial porn sites accessible in the UK). It requires them to *assess risk, prevent illegal and harmful content, protect children, provide reporting and appeal systems, safeguard journalism and democratic content, vet ads, and comply with Ofcom audits and penalties*.  

- **For ordinary users**, the Act doesn’t create general duties to monitor others’ speech. Instead:  
  - **Children** are subject to new age-gating — meaning *platforms* must keep them away from adult/harmful content, so children encounter more age checks.  
  - **Adults** face age-verification if they want to access pornographic content, and can opt into content filters on large platforms.  
  - **All users** are still personally liable under criminal law for offences: sending threats, knowingly false harmful messages, cyberflashing, etc.  

Everything else flows through **Ofcom’s regulation of platforms**.

Would you like me to now produce a **“before vs after” comparison for users** (what was already illegal, vs what the OSA newly criminalises or changes)? That would sharpen the “real effects” section of your report.

#### You:
there is this idea that "The OSA is stupid" because "The law is making me verify my age to access my direct messages", when really it isn't doing that, but providers/platforms are simply placing age-gating as a form of opt-out (like a 'cookie warning' or 'gdpr approval popup') instead of implementing policies to actually comply with the law. Discuss. Think about it.

#### ChatGPT:
You’re right to call that claim out. Here’s the clean version, grounded in what the law and Ofcom actually say.

# What the OSA really requires (the bits relevant to “DMs”)

1) **Who’s in scope?**  
   - Services with user-to-user features (including DMs) are “Part 3” services if they’re UK-linked (user-to-user: s.3; UK-link: s.5; exemptions in Scheds 1–2).

2) **Mandatory age checks are targeted, not blanket.**  
   - **Porn providers (Part 5)** must ensure children aren’t “normally able to encounter” porn, using **age verification or age estimation**. That’s a hard legal duty on porn sites and on any service that *publishes* porn; it is **not** a general rule for every feature like DMs. (Part 5, esp. s.79–s.82).

 
   - **For other services/features** (social, messaging, gaming), the children’s duties are **risk-based and proportionate**: if a service is “likely to be accessed by children”, it must assess risks and put in place measures (Part 3, ss.11–12; search equivalents ss.25–26). Ofcom’s codes **do not prescribe a single technology** and say providers have flexibility; “highly effective” age assurance is required where the risk profile demands it.                                                   

3) **Contact risks (DMs) are about protecting children from strangers, not making every adult prove their age.**  
   - Ofcom’s children’s codes set out +40 measures; one clear expectation is preventing **unsolicited contact from strangers to children** (e.g., by default blocks, contact limits, safer recommendations). That’s about *child protection design*, not blanket adult ID for DMs. [Age verification measures to regulate

# So why are some platforms prompting *everyone* to “verify” before using DMs?

This is mostly **provider choice**—a blunt way to show “we took steps” across the whole service, rather than implementing more targeted (and expensive) design changes.

- **Risk-based duty → blunt cure.** The Act says “proportionate measures”; Ofcom’s codes allow flexibility and **do not mandate ID checks** for all features. Providers can use age **estimation** (privacy-lighter) where appropriate. Many still flip on **service-wide gates** because they’re simple to evidence.

 
- **Cost & complexity.** Proper child-safety by design for DMs (default blocks on adult→child contact, friction for unknown contacts, better reporting UX, safer recommendations, graduated controls by estimated age) takes product work, moderation tooling and testing. A one-off age gate is cheaper/faster. (See Ofcom’s code/quick guides for the menu of measures, not a single “ID” pathway.)                                                     
- **Fear of fines / optics.** With **up to 10% global turnover** penalties and site blocking on the table, legal and PR teams bias to “over-comply”. Porn enforcement headlines reinforced the signal that Ofcom will act.                                                     
- **Global product templates.** Big platforms push one safety pattern across many markets; the UK then inherits a heavier gate than the codes strictly require.  
- **Vendor nudging.** Third-party “compliance” SaaS markets sell plug-and-play age-gating; that solution looks audit-friendly even if it’s blunter than necessary.

# The accurate takeaway

- **False claim:** “The OSA makes me verify my age to use DMs.”  
- **Accurate claim:** The OSA requires **porn age-checks** (Part 5) and **risk-based child-protection measures** (Part 3). Ofcom expects platforms to **stop strangers contacting children**, which can be delivered by design choices that **don’t** force universal ID/age steps for adult-to-adult DMs. **Blanket DM age-gating is a platform policy choice**, not a direct legal mandate.

If you want, I can sketch a one-pager “What the law requires” vs “What platforms are doing” with concrete examples of **targeted** DM safeguards that meet the code (default no adult-stranger DMs to accounts likely to be children; message-request friction; stricter attachment rules; faster reporting/lockouts), all without treating every adult like a porn-site visitor.

#### You:
from the perspective of a legal team working for say bluesky (in good faith, trying to be responsible) there is a case to be made that they implement age gating on DMs to protect themselves, like the tech team goes to the legal team and asks for their input, and the legal team reads these provisions and says "this tech is complicated, just age gate everybody and we don't have to worry about it", does that sound realistic?

#### ChatGPT:
Yes — that’s very realistic. If you put yourself in the shoes of a legal/compliance team at a company like Bluesky (or any mid-sized platform with UK users), the incentives line up almost exactly that way:

---

### 1. How the law reads to lawyers  
- **The Act’s wording is deliberately vague but high-stakes.**  
  - Duties on services are framed as “**take proportionate measures** to prevent children encountering harmful content or being contacted by strangers” (Part 3, ss.11–12).  
  - “Proportionate” is a **lawyer’s nightmare** — it means *case-by-case, judged later by Ofcom, tribunals, or courts*.  
- **Penalties are catastrophic** — up to 10% of *global* turnover, plus potential service blocking (Part 7, s.122, s.144–148). A lawyer’s risk lens says: “We can’t be the test case.”  
- **The regulator hasn’t run a full cycle yet.** Ofcom codes are being published, but until enforcement precedents are set, **the safest path is maximal compliance**.

---

### 2. How that translates into advice  
- **Legal teams tend to over-engineer guardrails** when the law is unclear but penalties are existential.  
- If the product team asks “what counts as protecting children in DMs?” a cautious lawyer may say:  
  > “You could build a nuanced contact-management system, but if Ofcom later says it wasn’t good enough, we’re exposed. A universal age-gate on DMs proves we took strong, visible action. Harder to fault.”  
- From a liability perspective, age-gating *everyone* is a **defensible audit trail**: you can show you applied the same test to all users, rather than trying to predict who might be a child.  

---

### 3. Why this matters  
- **Compliance simplicity vs. user experience**:  
  - Simplicity for lawyers: one system (everyone proves age once).  
  - Nightmare for users: friction, privacy concerns, sense of state overreach.  
- **Cost vs. nuance**: Building child-sensitive contact protections (like default-off DMs for under-18s, improved moderation, detection of grooming patterns) requires sustained engineering, testing, moderation staff, and risk modelling. That’s an ongoing cost.  
- **Time pressure**: With Ofcom deadlines (risk assessments by Mar–Apr 2025; children’s codes enforced from Jul 2025), legal/compliance departments will lean toward quick wins that tick a box on a spreadsheet, not multi-year feature builds.  

---

### 4. Is it “good faith”?  
Yes. From a lawyer’s standpoint, **“just age-gate everyone” is not malicious; it’s risk-averse compliance**. They’re protecting the company from fines and enforcement in a legally uncertain space. But the effect is **over-compliance**, similar to cookie pop-ups after GDPR: blunt measures that are easy to prove in court but go beyond what the law actually required.  

---

👉 So in short:  
- The OSA doesn’t require universal DM age-gating.  
- But for a risk-averse legal team at a service like Bluesky, **forcing everyone through an age check is a rational, if clumsy, strategy**. It’s the cheapest way to show Ofcom “we took the duty seriously,” even if it’s not user-friendly or aligned with the Act’s spirit.  

---

Do you want me to frame this in your **Broken Britain Briefing** piece as: *“The law didn’t demand this — the compliance culture did”*? That would let you show how structural incentives (legal vagueness + penalties + corporate caution) produced the outcomes people are blaming Labour for.

#### You:
we actually have a much deeper/longer journey on compliance culture and putting the burden on users every time, but for now... I need to know the precise paragraph/section numbers from the act about the sizes and scales of companies being controlled by this. I've seenvarious quotes, but can't find it myself in the text of the law.

#### ChatGPT:
Here are the precise parts of the Online Safety Act (and related regulation / advice) that deal with company / platform size & thresholds (e.g. Category 1 / 2A / 2B), along with what’s known / not yet fixed. Thought through carefully.

---

## What the Act says: threshold & categorisation clauses

- **Schedule 11, paragraphs 1-7** of the OSA: These specify what *factors / characteristics* the Secretary of State must consider when setting the **threshold conditions** for which services are designated under Category 1, 2A or 2B. Key parts:

  - It must include at least *one condition* relating to **number of users** (for appropriate part of the service). (Sch.11, para 1(1)-(3))  
  - It must include at least *one condition* relating to **functionality** of the service (for user-to-user services). (Sch.11, para 1(4))  
  - Additional “characteristics” (user base, business model, governance, etc.) *may* be taken into account.

- **Schedule 1 and 2** define which services are exempt and what counts as “regulated user-to-user” services, and whether a service has links with the UK. These decide what services are in scope in the first place.

- **Regulations – Category 1, 2A, 2B Threshold Conditions Regulations (2025)**: These secondary regulations (debated in Hansard, accepted Feb 24, 2025) set conditions for each category. They confirm that:

  - For **Category 1**: Thresholds must consider user numbers, functionalities, and how quickly/widely user-generated content spreads. Services with larger user base & high dissemination potential are targeted.

  - For **Category 2A** (search services): threshold condition must include number of users of search engine; other characteristics may apply.            
  - For **Category 2B** (some U2U services that aren’t Category 1): similar to Category 1 but less demanding; conditions include user numbers and functionalities.          

---

## What’s *not* yet fixed / known

- The Act *requires* secondary legislation (Regulations) to set the **numerical values** of those thresholds (e.g. “X million UK users”) for each category. Those numbers were proposed by Ofcom (as advice) but are not in the original Act text.

- Ofcom’s advice (Mar 2024) suggests example thresholds (e.g., more than ~34 million UK users with recommender system, or ~7 million + certain functionalities), but those are **recommendations**, not statutory until the Regs pass.          

---

## Known example or draft threshold numbers (from Ofcom’s advice / secondary legislation)

- **3 million UK users** + direct messaging capability → one recommendation for **Category 2B** U2U services.

If you like, I can pull up the *exact draft regulation text* with the numerical thresholds as laid out Feb 2025, so you can quote that in your report.

#### You:
yes please

#### ChatGPT:
Here are the **exact thresholds** in the *Online Safety Act 2023 (Category 1, Category 2A and Category 2B Threshold Conditions) Regulations 2025* (SI 2025/226), along with how they define active UK users. All copied from the (laid) regulation, so you can quote them.

---

## What the Regulations say: Numerical Thresholds

### Category 1 (User-to-User Services)

A regulated user-to-user service meets the Category 1 threshold if **one of** these is true (Regulation 3):

1. The user-to-user part of the service has **more than 34 million** average monthly active UK users **and** uses a **content recommender system**,  
   OR  
2. It has **more than 7 million** average monthly active UK users, uses a content recommender system, **and** provides a functionality for users to forward or share regulated user-generated content with other users.

---

### Category 2A (Search / Combined Services)

A regulated search service (or combined service with search part) meets the Category 2A threshold if (Regulation 4):

- It has **more than 7 million** average monthly active UK users,  
- and it is **not** a “vertical search engine” (i.e. not just for a specific topic/genre/theme / only searching selected sites via API, etc.).

---

### Category 2B (User-to-User Services, Lower Category)

A regulated user-to-user service meets the Category 2B threshold if (Regulation 5):

- It has **more than 3 million** average monthly active UK users,  
- and provides a functionality allowing users to send **direct messages** to other users of the same service, where those messages are **not** visible to other users unless further action is taken by the sender or receiver.

---

## How “Average Monthly Active UK Users” is Calculated

(Regulation 6):

- It means the **mean** number of active UK users per month over a **six-month period** ending with the month **before** the month in which the assessment begins.  
- If the service has been operating less than six months, then use the period it *has* been operating.

#### You:
what else do people need to know about the issues raised in this entire chat?

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s me taking a step back and synthesising. Across this whole thread, you’re circling around three intertwined themes: **how Britain makes laws like the OSA**, **how compliance culture and media incentives distort their effects**, and **how the information environment shapes who gets blamed**.  

If you want your readers to really *get it*, here are the key issues they should understand:  

---

## 1. The OSA is a **cross-party project**  
- It’s tempting to say “this is Tory nanny-statism” or “this is Labour’s mess,” but the truth is both parties **co-authored, supported, and delivered** it.  
- Conservatives built the architecture (2017–2023), Labour endorsed the principles in opposition and then fast-tracked it in power (2024–25).  
- This is important because it shows the *structural bipartisan instinct*: when “something must be done” politics collides with child safety moral pressure, both parties prefer action over nuance.  

---

## 2. **The law vs. the implementation**  
- The Act itself is **risk-based** and framed in vague, “proportionate” language. It does *not* say “all DMs require age verification.”  
- But **compliance culture** + **fear of catastrophic fines** + **lack of enforcement precedents** pushes legal teams to advise platforms to **over-comply**.  
- Result: blunt measures (universal age-gating, pop-ups, opt-outs) that **shift burdens onto users** — like GDPR cookie banners all over again.  

---

## 3. **What’s actually new**  
- Most of the “harms” were already crimes (CSAM, terrorism, revenge porn, fraud).  
- The real shift is that platforms are now legally responsible for **preventing users from encountering them** (not just reacting).  
- The other genuinely new pieces:  
  - Mandatory **porn age verification** (Part 5).  
  - **New offences** like cyberflashing, encouraging self-harm, knowingly false harmful communications (Part 10).  
  - **Huge fines and blocking powers** for Ofcom.  

---

## 4. **Privacy vs. protection is designed into the trade-offs**  
- The most visible “cost” for users is privacy intrusion via age checks.  
- The intended “benefit” is reduced exposure of kids to porn, abuse, scams, self-harm material.  
- But because the duties are vague and enforcement is untested, the balance tips toward **over-removal, over-verification, and over-blocking**, with real risks for speech, anonymity, and user trust.  

---

## 5. **Media environment shapes perception**  
- Most people only “see” the privacy intrusion (age-checks) because that’s tangible.  
- The press — especially right-leaning titles and newer broadcasters like GB News — are eager to frame Labour as *culpable* in every negative outcome, regardless of Tory origins.  
- Social media outrage feeds on those framings, but the raw material nearly always originates from traditional press or regulator announcements.  
- This leads to a distorted picture: the OSA’s genuine benefits (scam reduction, faster removal of illegal content) are less visible than the **annoyances and intrusions**.  

---

## 6. **Journalism itself is squeezed**  
- Investigative, balanced reporting is expensive and slow, but the business model rewards fast, negative, emotional content.  
- Shrinking newsrooms, PR dominance, and platform choke-points mean **stories like “ID for DMs” travel faster** than nuanced legal analysis.  
- That accelerates the “bad law → bad platform implementation → bad press → blame cycle” dynamic.  

---

## 7. **Comparative context matters**  
- UK’s information environment is not uniquely bad. The BBC, despite criticisms, is still more balanced than most national broadcasters elsewhere.  
- But trust is eroding, news avoidance is high, and platforms are withdrawing from news distribution. That leaves the field open for **outrage amplification**.  
- Compared to other democracies, Britain is **middling**: worse than Nordic public-service-driven ecosystems, but less captured than US or Hungarian-style hyper-polarisation.  

---

## 8. **The structural story**  
The deeper through-line is:  
- **Politicians**: default to “do something” laws framed around child safety.  
- **Companies**: default to over-compliance because vagueness + huge fines.  
- **Media**: default to the most visible/controversial symptom (age checks, speech takedowns), not the deeper trade-offs.  
- **Public**: mostly feel the burdens, not the protections, so blame falls on whoever is in power.

👉 That’s the “what people need to know.” It’s not just that the OSA is clumsy. It’s that Britain’s **political, corporate, and media ecosystems together almost guarantee** that laws like this will be vague, over-implemented, badly explained, and resented — even when they were trying to solve a real problem.  

Do you want me to draft this up as a **narrative “executive summary” section** for your *Broken Britain Briefing* sub-report, so it slots straight in after the timeline/accountability table?
