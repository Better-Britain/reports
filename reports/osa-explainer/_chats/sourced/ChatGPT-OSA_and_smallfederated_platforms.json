Departing from its earlier self-verification method, which relied on custom domains in user handles, Bluesky is now implementing a more traditional blue check mark system to identify notable accounts. The process prioritizes verification for government officials, journalists, news outlets, and celebrities, and the company plans to open public verification requests in the future. This move comes amid increasing impersonation concerns, particularly with the platform's rising user base, including high-profile figures like former President Barack Obama. In addition to internal verification, Bluesky is adopting a decentralized approach by partnering with vetted entities like The New York Times and WIRED to act as “trusted verifiers,” marked with scalloped check marks. Verified accounts—whether authenticated by Bluesky or third-party verifiers—will display consistent check marks, with source details accessible through user interaction.

Despite no detailed comments on his departure from Bluesky or the timing, the company expressed gratitude to Dorsey for his contributions and is now seeking a new board member who aligns with their ethos.

La plataforma tiene una interfaz similar a X, facilitando la transición para los nuevos usuarios. Permite publicar mensajes cortos, seguir a otros usuarios, interactuar con publicaciones, y personalizar la experiencia de acuerdo a las preferencias individuales.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1731943725,"attribution":"los40.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68cc1892f424832992e4f84aa9a1f638","search_turns_count":1,"search_source":"composer_auto","client_reported_search_source":"composer_auto","request_id":"981190d33f42a690-LHR","message_type":"variant","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","parent_id":"ca615758-b973-45db-9ada-1a10c454d8a2","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ca615758-b973-45db-9ada-1a10c454d8a2","children":["8b4af4c7-bc80-476c-9a7c-16d2f0c6fb71"]},"8b4af4c7-bc80-476c-9a7c-16d2f0c6fb71":{"id":"8b4af4c7-bc80-476c-9a7c-16d2f0c6fb71","message":{"id":"8b4af4c7-bc80-476c-9a7c-16d2f0c6fb71","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"sonicberry_model_id":"current_sonicberry_paid","real_author":"tool:web","source":"sonic_tool"}},"create_time":1758206100.673135,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Bluesky is built on the **AT Protocol** (Authenticated Transfer Protocol). citeturn0search3turn0search0turn0search23\n\nSome details:\n\n- Open-source framework for social apps. citeturn0search3  \n- Federation / interoperability between instances (Personal Data Servers) so users can retain identity, follows, etc. across servers. citeturn0search23turn0search5turn0search15  \n- Licensed under MIT / Apache for many parts. citeturn0search23turn0search16  \n\nIf you meant something else by \"defed platform\", tell me — I can clarify."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"citeturn0search3turn0search0turn0search23","start_idx":75,"end_idx":121,"safe_urls":["https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluesky?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([docs.bsky.app](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The AT Protocol","url":"https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol, or atproto) is a standard for public conversation and an open-source framework for building social apps.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Bluesky","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluesky?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"","attribution":"Wikipedia"},{"title":"AT Protocol","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"","attribution":"Wikipedia"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":23}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"docs.bsky.app"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn0search3","start_idx":179,"end_idx":198,"safe_urls":["https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([docs.bsky.app](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The AT Protocol","url":"https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"The AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol, or atproto) is a standard for public conversation and an open-source framework for building social apps.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"docs.bsky.app"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn0search23turn0search5turn0search15","start_idx":335,"end_idx":382,"safe_urls":["https://bsky.social/about/faq?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://docs.bsky.app/blog/building-on-atproto?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"AT Protocol","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1757256849,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Company - Bluesky","url":"https://bsky.social/about/faq?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"While Bluesky — built on AT Protocol — shares the term “federation” with other networks, the way it works is very different.

This move follows the arrest of Telegram's founder, Pavel Durov, and several leaders of the neo-Nazi Terrorgram Collective, which has led users to fear that Telegram's privacy policies aren't secure enough. Researchers from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue revealed that these extremist groups are using the app to share dangerous content and organize violent activities. SimpleX offers enhanced privacy features, such as end-to-end encryption by default and no requirement for phone numbers or emails, making it attractive to these groups. Developer Evgeny Poberezkin claims to be unaware of this migration and asserts that SimpleX can curb the spread of illegal content on its servers.

They’re more like:  \n\n- **“A protocol, not a platform.”** That’s the line Bluesky uses a lot: the **AT Protocol** is the thing, Bluesky is just one app on top of it.  \n- **For Signal** — nobody frames it as a protocol host because you can’t federate/self-host. Signal is just “a service,” so the OSA applies to *Signal Messenger Inc.*, full stop.  \n- **For Telegram** — same deal, it’s centralised, so there’s no “small operator” carve-out.  \n- **For Bluesky** (and Mastodon/ActivityPub, Matrix, etc.) — here people say things like:  \n  - *“It’s federated”*  \n  - *“It runs on ActivityPub”* (for Mastodon and friends)  \n  - *“It runs on the AT Protocol”* (for Bluesky)  \n  - *“Matrix”* (for federated chat, often compared against Signal/Telegram)  \n\nSo in those “OSA loophole” discussions, the names that come up are **ActivityPub, Matrix,

Some parts of your idea are possible/allowed, but there are big caveats. Here’s a breakdown:\n\n---\n\n## What the OSA *does* say\n\n- The OSA regulates *user-to-user (U2U) services* and *search services* that have “links with the UK,” even if based elsewhere. citeturn0search17turn0search2turn0search4turn0search9  \n- The obligations vary by service size, functionality, and risk. Smaller services have proportionately lighter duties. citeturn0search0turn0search4turn0search9turn0search10  \n- All in-scope U2U services must do risk assessments for illegal content, put in place reporting / takedown processes, mitigate harm etc. citeturn0search4turn0search0turn0search2  \n\n---\n\n## What is *not clear / might prevent* your idea\n\n- The law doesn’t explicitly talk about “federated services” or “protocol-based networks” (like Mastodon or ActivityPub) and offer special carve-outs for them. It treats “service providers” broadly in terms of what an “online service” is. If your server is part of a network that interacts with others, you may still be seen as an “operator/provider of a U2U service.”  \n\n- “Staying small” helps reduce the scope or severity of duties (smaller scale/risk = fewer obligations) but doesn’t exempt you entirely if you are “in scope.” Having users in the UK or risks for UK users can bring you under OSA even if you are small or mostly external. citeturn0search4turn0search3turn0search2  \n\n- Ofcom and secondary legislation will define thresholds for “Category 1 / 2 etc.” services (size, functionality etc.). If your federated node’s usage meets or contributes to those thresholds, you may be in one of the more heavily regulated categories. citeturn0search10turn0search9  \n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour scenario *might* work, but only if:\n\n1. Your server/instance is small enough (in user-count, traffic, risk) and/or limited in functionality.  \n2. The server/operator is careful about whether they have a “significant number of UK users” or target the UK.  \n3. You keep up with all the basic risk assessment, reporting, content moderation obligations (even if minimal).  \n\nIf you like, I can try to model what duties *your specific use-case* (say a Mastodon-type instance for a small org) would have under OSA, so you can see concretely what you’d need to do."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"citeturn0search17turn0search2turn0search4turn0search9","start_idx":416,"end_idx":475,"safe_urls":["https://www.eversheds-sutherland.com/en/global/insights/u-ks-online-safety-act-what-service-providers-need-to-know?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.hsfkramer.com/insights/key-topics/who-is-caught-by-the-osa?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/guide-for-services?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.taylorwessing.com/-/media/taylor-wessing/files/uk/2024/2402004428-v1-gric-osa-vs-dsa-table.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Herbert

The OSA obligations sit with them.  \n\n**Federated model (Mastodon/Matrix/Bluesky style)**  \n- You *really do* run the infra — your own server.  \n- That server talks to other servers over a shared protocol.  \n- In OSA terms, *you* are the provider of a “user-to-user service” (because you’re transmitting user-generated content).  \n- So even if there’s a “unified UI” (like a client that can log into multiple servers), the OSA treats each backend server/operator as its own provider.  \n\n**Key difference**  \n- With Discord, all legal duties concentrate on one company.  \n- With federation, the duties distribute: every operator is technically on the hook (though the scale of duty depends on size, features, and risk).  \n\nSo: if you spin up a Mastodon instance for your org, under OSA you’re not “just a Discord server admin” — you’re more like “a mini-Discord, but federated.” You get obligations (risk assessments, illegal content handling, etc.), though lighter than the Category 1 giants.  \n\nWant me to sketch a simple 3-column table — *Centralised (Discord), Federated (Mastodon/Matrix), Hybrid (like Element hosting Matrix servers for you)* — showing exactly where the legal hook lands in each case?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"98119cbb88bca690-LHR","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-instant","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-instant","parent_id":"0bf16227-5df1-4a03-b156-bf3163aa3955","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0bf16227-5df1-4a03-b156-bf3163aa3955","children":["818f05be-0d34-446d-9bd2-26a63e01c8c4"]},"818f05be-0d34-446d-9bd2-26a63e01c8c4":{"id":"818f05be-0d34-446d-9bd2-26a63e01c8c4","message":{"id":"818f05be-0d34-446d-9bd2-26a63e01c8c4","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758206618.975,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["oh, you can't run your own discord server outside of discord? like slack?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"98119dea399ea690-LHR","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f5cb3478-3a9f-4e14-9686-17187abfbce0","children":["9b691e88-7ded-4795-87e7-371d9e05b225"]},"9b691e88-7ded-4795-87e7-371d9e05b225":{"id":"9b691e88-7ded-4795-87e7-371d9e05b225","message":{"id":"9b691e88-7ded-4795-87e7-371d9e05b225","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758206619.682781,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Correct — with **Discord** (and **Slack** too):  \n\n- You can create “servers” (Discord) or “workspaces” (Slack), but they are **logical partitions** inside the company’s own infrastructure.  \n- You can’t take the server software, spin it up on your own VPS, and have it interoperate with the main network.  \n- All the infra is controlled by Discord Inc. or Slack Technologies.  \n\nThat’s why people often contrast them with **Matrix** or **Mastodon**:  \n- With Matrix or Mastodon you *can* run your own server software, under your own domain, and it can federate with others.  \n- With Discord/Slack you *cannot* — you’re always inside their walled garden.  \n\nSo yeah: “Discord server” ≠ “self-hosted server.” It’s closer to a chatroom or namespace that Discord Inc. runs for you.  \n\nWant me to list the main **chat/collaboration systems you *can* actually self-host** and still interconnect with bigger networks?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"request_id":"98119dea399ea690-LHR","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-instant","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-instant","parent_id":"818f05be-0d34-446d-9bd2-26a63e01c8c4","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"818f05be-0d34-446d-9bd2-26a63e01c8c4","children":["3ca5ec91-1fac-4fb2-ae66-3b385b321f75"]},"3ca5ec91-1fac-4fb2-ae66-3b385b321f75":{"id":"3ca5ec91-1fac-4fb2-ae66-3b385b321f75","message":{"id":"3ca5ec91-1fac-4fb2-ae66-3b385b321f75","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758206657.433,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["ahh, I thought they were genuinely self-hosted.

Telegram, widely used for its secure communication capabilities, particularly in countries with government censorship, employs the MTProto encryption protocol to protect user messages. However, Telegram's bot platform does not use this protocol, instead relying on the weaker TLS encryption. Bots, small programs integrated into chats to perform various functions, compromise the app's security by downgrading encryption when added to a chat or channel. Forcepoint discovered this while researching malware-controlled bots, revealing that bot-related communications lack the robust protection offered by MTProto. Telegram has acknowledged that bot communications use HTTPS but argues that obtaining bot API tokens is analogous to stealing passwords. To maintain security, users are advised to avoid adding bots to their chats and reducing chat participants.

The law imposes stringent new regulations on digital platforms, and Wikipedia, which is operated by Wikimedia, argued in court that if it were classified under the most stringent \"Category 1\" rules, it could be forced to verify contributor identities, significantly limiting access for UK users. Although the UK High Court rejected the challenge, Judge Jeremy Johnson clarified that his ruling does not permit indiscriminate enforcement on platforms like Wikipedia. The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, is still assessing which platforms fall into Category 1. Wikimedia expressed concern about the law’s potential impact on free speech and Wikipedia’s open-edit model but plans to closely monitor how the regulations are implemented. Wikimedia’s counsel, Phil Bradley-Schmieg, emphasized the need for a more proportionate approach from Ofcom and highlighted the ongoing risk posed by the current rules. The U.S. government and President Donald Trump have also criticized the UK’s law, citing concerns over its implications for freedom of speech.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1757707476,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-sets-first-codes-practice-tech-firms-online-safety-regime-2024-12-16/","title":"Britain sets first codes of practice for tech firms in online safety regime","snippet":"Britain has launched its online safety regime, mandating social media firms like Facebook and TikTok to address illegal activities and prioritize safety on their platforms.

While acknowledging the act's goal of protecting children online, X argues that its enforcement, particularly by Ofcom, is overly aggressive and may lead to unnecessary censorship. The criticism follows the implementation of new restrictions aimed at preventing minors from accessing harmful content, including pornography, as of July 25. Musk labeled the act as a tool for public suppression, and a petition to repeal it has gained over 450,000 signatures.\n\nX expressed concern that the UK government made a deliberate choice to increase censorship in the name of safety, potentially without full public awareness of this trade-off. The platform also took issue with proposals like a national internet investigations team to monitor anti-migrant content, calling it excessive. Ofcom and the UK government defended the act, stating it includes strong protections for freedom of expression and only targets illegal or harmful content to children. The government emphasized that platforms could face penalties for failing to uphold both online safety and free speech obligations.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754067988,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68cc1ad6e1d88331933dcb827d883ccf","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for OSA and Ofcom references","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"98119edabe5da690-LHR","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"3cb1b96e-c3f6-40ce-803f-600282e3f10e","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3cb1b96e-c3f6-40ce-803f-600282e3f10e","children":["df0942de-87ef-4742-ac50-e2f5c7b6d3e2"]},"df0942de-87ef-4742-ac50-e2f5c7b6d3e2":{"id":"df0942de-87ef-4742-ac50-e2f5c7b6d3e2","message":{"id":"df0942de-87ef-4742-ac50-e2f5c7b6d3e2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1758206695.72652,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking up Discord/Slack info","content":"I need to find official details from Discord or Slack to clarify that their servers are hosted on their infrastructure and that self-hosting isn’t an option.
