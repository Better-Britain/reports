# OSA policy review

#### You:
Let's just log this one.... I'm not sure if I want to change it yet. Give me a version in exactly my words/phrasing, but join up those couple of run-on paragraphs cos I think better when I skeet.

Maybe I'm going insane cos I've read some of the most boring docs this week, but I did a deep dive on the OSA, and have been digesting it, and feel it's not _THAT_ bad. Places that are compliant & trustworthy (like Pornhub or Reddit) use good quality and safe verifiers that do not keep your data.

There definitely could (and should) have been some more reasonable exclusions (like Xbox, maybe), but over the years even I've heard the occasional creepy dude being way too familiar with kids on group chat, _maybe_ this does help prevent/discourage that. I don't like how it incentivises accounts...

but... it's not like every social network was trying to avoid holding personal data anyway, so in a good faith world, and understanding that it was a cross-party policy developed over 6 years by mostly idiots (like Nadine Dorries, ffs), it certainly _could_ have been much worse.

Most of my policy write-ups try pretty hard to avoid opinion (I have an item tag for it tho), and I've even had to begrudgingly score up some policies I don't personally like, because they have objective benefits.

It's easy to say a law is stupid because it's 'easy to break' but that's not the point. It's easy to break the law about not speeding or not stealing, or even many worse ones, but I wonder what tech all the angry old men on facebook and angry old women on instagram think would be harder to bypass.

I think in the light of patient consideration (and far too many PDFs), I've come around on the OSA. It _is_ a stupid law, but there wasn't going to be a better one, so fuck it.

Here’s your skeet thread cleaned up into a single blog-ready version, in your own words/phrasing, just with the run-ons joined so it reads as one piece:

Want me to drop this into *my-blog.txt* as a logged entry so it sits alongside the others?

#### You:
what's your take on the subject matter?

#### ChatGPT:
I think your read is fair. The OSA is clumsy and, in places, badly conceived — but it’s not the doomsday legislation some people paint it as either.  

On the positive side:  
- Big, compliant platforms like Reddit and Pornhub already have processes that mean the data isn’t being hoarded in some insecure black hole. If more sites follow that model, the privacy risk is less catastrophic than critics suggest.  
- Having some baseline expectation of safety in group chats (especially where kids are involved) is not the worst possible outcome.  

On the negative side:  
- The exclusions are a mess — targeting “obvious” places but leaving edge-cases open, which makes enforcement patchy and inconsistent.  
- Smaller platforms and independents are still squeezed, because they can’t afford the compliance overhead. That means the law reinforces the position of giants rather than creating a genuinely safer ecosystem.  
- The “easy to break” critique isn’t wrong: VPNs and spoofing exist, and kids who want to get around barriers will. The benefit is deterrence and friction, not airtight protection.  

So yeah, it’s stupid in its design — a Frankenstein’s monster of cross-party compromises and performative politics — but not world-ending in its execution. More of a “lowest common denominator” law than an actively harmful one, which is unusual for the UK right now.  

Do you want me to sketch this out as a short add-on paragraph at the end of your logged post, like a detached “editor’s note” giving the take?

#### You:
okay let's just add...

The biggest real cost is to small companies trying to set-up new platforms, and while it's not massive, it does cost money to integrate a responsible age verifier. Though it's at best fractional compared to the bigger cost of per-request/gb cloud infrastructure (already 4-5x a dedicated server).

It's not like verification is going to be the sole factor stopping some fresh faced young business mogul from disrupting youtube.

I think I’ve come round on the OSA
Maybe I’m going insane cos I’ve read some of the most boring docs this week, but I did a deep dive on the OSA, and have been digesting it, and feel it’s not that bad. Places that are compliant & trustworthy (like Pornhub or Reddit) use good quality and safe verifiers that do not keep your data. There definitely could (and should) have been some more reasonable exclusions (like Xbox, maybe), but over the years even I’ve heard the occasional creepy dude being way too familiar with kids on open voice chat, maybe this does help prevent/discourage that. I don’t like how it incentivises keeping accounts (rather than throwaways that don’t connect everything to you personally), but… it’s not like every social network was trying to avoid holding personal data anyway, so in a good faith world, and understanding that it was a cross-party policy developed over 6 years by mostly idiots (like Nadine Dorries, ffs), it certainly could have been much worse.

It’s easy to say a law is stupid because it’s “easy to break,” but that’s not the point. It’s easy to break the law about not speeding or not stealing, or even many worse ones, but I wonder what tech all the angry old men on Facebook and angry old women on Instagram think would be harder to bypass.

The biggest real cost is to small companies trying to set-up new platforms, and while it’s not massive, it does cost money to integrate a responsible age verifier. Though it’s at best fractional compared to the bigger cost of per-request/gb cloud infrastructure (already 4-5x a dedicated server). It’s not like verification is going to be the sole factor stopping some fresh faced young business mogul from disrupting YouTube.

If you’re being forced to verify your age by any platform by providing a scan of your ID or your face (either through tech on their servers, or more commonly through a third-party plug-in), you can do that safely *IF* their verification provider guarantees that they do not keep your photo/video/id-scan stored at all. They do not need it except for at the instant of verification, when they can simply log a flag for your account. Compliant verifiers should be be able to make that claim and prove it.

There are already really stupid/lazy implementations: Steam has decided “Your UK Steam user account is considered age verified for as long as a valid credit card is stored on the account.”, which is a moronic policy. I’ve never had a credit card on steam, and I’m pretty sure my account is 20+ years old as I’ve had it since Half Life 2 released.

I know old folks who don’t have a credit card, and some poor folks too, so Steam really need to find a verification service provider and plug them into their system. They only age-gate 18+ rated games (so no sticky anime girls being pushed at kids), which obviously sucks if you’re over 18 and that’s your thing, but some of the creepy stuff Steam have on their platform since they lowered the gates already borders on illegal anyway. It turns out if you don’t moderate your storefront, the nazis and the other monsters will use it for evil, and no amount of closing your eyes and pretending it isn’t happening is going to make them stop polluting your storefront.

Sometimes when businesses make you jump through stupid hoops, like scrolling the billion things that could be in your mobile game loot-box, and having to click agree before you can open a free loot-box, or like when you have to click 15 checkboxes before you can close the cookie warning with a setting that isn’t ‘I agree to whatever’, they’re doing it like that on purpose, so you don’t actually take the time to use your rights (it’s called a dark pattern). Some businesses are doing the same with OSA now, they’re choosing the worst possible option for *you*, so *they* have to change as little as possible. The point of the new laws are to make companies treat you better, and if they won’t you kinda have to choose to stop using them until they do.

Other countries will be following this model too (probably not the US), so you can see this as a pilot for now. They’re not going to undo it, and the decision-makers in the UK govt already think it’s gone pretty well, and that only the optics and the communications were a failure.

I think in the light of patient consideration (and after reading far too many policy PDFs this week), I’ve come around on the OSA. It is a stupid law, but there wasn’t going to be a better one, so fuck it.

#### ChatGPT:
This reads well — it’s clear, sticks to your phrasing, and holds together as a proper blog entry. A few things I’d flag on a technical/clarity check rather than style:  

- **“set-up” → “set up”** — “set-up” is the noun, “set up” is the verb (here you mean the verb).  
- **“per-request/gb”** — I’d make it “per-request/GB” for clarity (capitalising GB to avoid it looking like “gigabytes” is just some weird suffix).  
- **“should be be able”** — double “be.” Just needs trimming.  
- **Steam bit** — you might want to clarify “credit card” vs “debit card.” Lots of UK folks don’t have an actual credit card but do have debit, and Steam has historically mixed those up in policy language.  
- **“nazis and the other monsters”** — stylistically fine (it’s your voice), but if you want Tumblr discoverability, maybe hyphen “nazi-games” or “nazi-content” to make the context clearer.  

Otherwise it’s solid. Good balance of your own take, concrete examples (Steam, dark patterns), and a clean arc from initial skepticism to reluctant acceptance.  

Want me to sweep through it and apply just those 4–5 micro-fixes so the piece reads sharper without changing tone?

#### You:
they said credit card, no mention of debit cards

#### ChatGPT:
Got it — then I’d leave that bit as-is. Steam really did say *credit card*, so better to keep the quote literal and let it stand as their own daft policy.  

That just leaves the little cleanups (“set-up” → “set up,” “per-request/GB,” “be be” → “be”). Want me to patch those in for you so the draft’s tight without losing any of your phrasing?

#### You:
what are some high profile 'creep' or 'nazi' games still live on steam?

#### ChatGPT:
You're asking about **high-profile “creep” or “Nazi” games still live on Steam**. Here are some notable examples—not all explicitly Nazi-themed, but associated with extremism, hateful or shock-value content that's raised serious concerns:

---

### 1. **Hatred**
- A brutally violent shoot-’em-up where you play as a misanthropic mass-murderer on a genocidal rampage.
- It deliberately pushes graphic violence as a reaction against “political correctness”—and it remains available on Steam despite its controversial nature.

### 3. **Extremist Communities and Hateful Content on Steam**
While not specific standalone games, Steam's ecosystem continues to host extremist content through community features:
- Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups—some dating back years—use forums, livestreams, and group pages to spread ideology.[How the Far Right Exploded on Steam and Discord](https://www.wired.com/story/far-right-took-over-steam-discord/) [what is steam doing to address neo nazi content :: \.\.\.](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/3826424631144610654/?ctp=6&l=koreana) [Valve Removes Nazi Steam Profiles After German \.\.\.](https://kotaku.com/valve-removes-nazi-steam-profiles-after-german-complain-1840370971) [White Supremacist, Nazi Content Spread on Steam Game \.\.\.](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1grcnsc/white_supremacist_nazi_content_spread_on_steam/) [Senator Hassan Presses Major Video Game Platform to \.\.\.](https://www.hassan.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/vice-senator-hassan-presses-major-video-game-platform-to-address-online-extremism-including-neo-nazi-content) [List of controversial video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_controversial_video_games) [Ethnic Cleansing \(video game\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_Cleansing_%28video_game%29) [White Supremacist, Nazi Content Spread on Steam Game \.\.\.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-14/white-supremacist-nazi-content-spread-on-steam-gaming-platform) [Through The Darkest of Times](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003090/Through_the_Darkest_of_Times/) [Extremist identity creation through performative infighting \.\.\.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12379067/) [Senator to Valve: what's with all the Nazis on Steam?](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/15/24297364/steam-extremist-content-moderation-us-senator-warner-letter) [Steam players in shock after almost 2million instances of hateful conduct and messages are found](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/31748499/steam-hate-extremist-speech-report/) [The Extreme Right on Steam | ISD](https://www.isdglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/02-revised-gaming-report-steam.pdf) [How the Far Right Exploded on Steam and Discord](https://www.wired.com/story/far-right-took-over-steam-discord) [Hatred \(video game\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatred_%28video_game%29) [The ADL Calls Out Steam for Giving Extremists a Pass](https://www.wired.com/story/valve-steam-adl-white-supremacy-extremism) [Sniper Elite V2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper_Elite_V2)

##  Explicit Nazi / White Supremacist Games

### **Ethnic Cleansing** *(2002)*
- A first-person shooter developed by a known neo-Nazi group (National Alliance) where the player controls a KKK member or neo-Nazi and shoots African Americans, Latinos, and Jews depicted via racist stereotypes—including monkey sounds and slurs. Final boss is Ariel Sharon with a rocket launcher.

- This game **is not on Steam**, but still relevant for context of extremist content in games.

##  Nazi Imagery in Historically-Themed Games

### **Attentat 1942** *(2017, on Steam)*

Would you like to dive deeper on any of these, or explore examples of extremist mods, user-generated content, or comparable issues on other platforms?



#### You:
okay how's this?

I think I’ve come round on the OSA
Maybe I’m going insane cos I’ve read some of the most boring docs this week, but I did a deep dive on the OSA, and have been digesting it, and feel it’s not that bad. Places that are compliant & trustworthy (like Pornhub or Reddit) use good quality and safe verifiers that do not keep your data. There definitely could (and should) have been some more reasonable exclusions (like Xbox, maybe), but over the years even I’ve heard the occasional creepy dude being way too familiar with kids on open voice chat, maybe this does help prevent/discourage that. I don’t like how it incentivises keeping accounts (rather than throwaways that don’t connect everything to you personally), but… it’s not like every social network was trying to avoid holding personal data anyway, so in a good faith world, and understanding that it was a cross-party policy developed over 6 years by mostly idiots (like Nadine Dorries, ffs), it certainly could have been much worse.

It’s easy to say a law is stupid because it’s “easy to break,” but that’s not the point. It’s easy to break the law about not speeding or not stealing, or even many worse ones, but I wonder what tech all the angry old men on Facebook and angry old women on Instagram think would be harder to bypass.

The biggest real cost is to small companies trying to set-up new platforms, and while it’s not massive, it does cost money to integrate a responsible age verifier. Though it’s at best fractional compared to the bigger cost of per-request/GB cloud infrastructure (already 4-5x a dedicated server). It’s not like verification is going to be the sole factor stopping some fresh faced young business mogul from disrupting YouTube.

If you’re being forced to verify your age by any platform by providing a scan of your ID or your face (either through tech on their servers, or more commonly through a third-party plug-in), you can do that safely *IF* their verification provider guarantees that they do not keep your photo/video/id-scan stored at all. They do not need it except for at the instant of verification, when they can simply log a flag for your account. Compliant verifiers should be be able to make that claim and prove it.

Businesses gonna business
There are already really stupid/lazy implementations: Steam has decided “Your UK Steam user account is considered age verified for as long as a valid credit card is stored on the account.”, which is a moronic policy. I’ve never had a credit card on steam, and I’m pretty sure my account is 20+ years old as I’ve had it since Half Life 2 released.

I know old folks who don’t have a credit card, and some poor folks too, so Steam really need to find a verification service provider and plug them into their system. They only age-gate 18+ rated games (so no sticky anime girls being pushed at kids), which obviously sucks if you’re over 18 and that’s your thing, but some of the creepy stuff Steam have on their platform since they lowered the gates already borders on illegal anyway. It turns out if you don’t moderate your storefront, the nazi-games and the creeps will use it for evil, and no amount of closing your eyes and pretending it isn’t happening is going to make them stop polluting your storefront.

It’s all good being a techbro neo-hippy until you’re taking 30% of the sale price of games that support steam users to spreading their monstrous SA or ethnic cleansing fantasies in groups on the platform, under the guise of being edgy.

Sometimes when businesses make you jump through stupid hoops, like scrolling the billion things that could be in your mobile game loot-box, and having to click agree before you can open a free loot-box, or like when you have to click 15 checkboxes before you can close the cookie warning with a setting that isn’t ‘I agree to whatever’, they’re doing it like that on purpose, so you don’t actually take the time to use your rights (it’s called a dark pattern). Some businesses are doing the same with OSA now, they’re choosing the worst possible option for *you*, so *they* have to change as little as possible. The point of the new laws are to make companies treat you better, and if they won’t you kinda have to choose to stop using them until they do.

Other countries will be following this model too (probably not the US), so you can see this as a pilot for now. They’re not going to undo it, and the decision-makers in the UK govt already think it’s gone pretty well, and that only the optics and the communications were a failure.

I think in the light of patient consideration (and after reading far too many policy PDFs this week), I’ve come around on the OSA. It is a stupid law, but there wasn’t going to be a better one, so fuck it.

#### ChatGPT:
This version works really well. It’s coherent, carries your voice all the way through, and the “Businesses gonna business” section gives it a nice shift of tone without breaking the flow. A few micro-tweaks worth considering:  

- **“set-up new platforms” → “set up new platforms”** (verb form, not noun).  
- **“per-request/GB”** looks cleaner capitalised than “per-request/gb”.  
- **“be be able”** → “be able”.  
- Maybe trim “steam users to spreading” → “Steam users spreading” in that sentence about SA/ethnic cleansing fantasies, just to smooth the read.  

Otherwise it’s tight. You’ve got a good mix of your own conclusion, concrete examples (Steam, dark patterns), and policy context. It feels like a proper blog entry now.  

Want me to run through and patch just those small slips for you, so it’s clean but still *your* draft?

#### You:
I have a follow-up on this, that addresses the Steam implementation more directly. Not sure if I want to make a blog post of it, or just work it into my explainer somewhere. This also depends on info in my other OSA chat that sticks to the more formal end of its details, but logging this here from my skeet thread, mainly so I can delete it and still access these thoughts...

Valve blaming their choice of lazy/weak implementation (require a credit card, instead of implementing or integrating age verification certified to be safe) on the grounds that it's unsafe, instead of admitting that updating their dinosaur-corpse rat-king of tech-debt would be hard.

Steam's age verification method for UK customers is leaving others in the dust
Valve has outlined how its Steam storefront will comply with the UK Online Safety Act and requirements for age verification. It's refreshingly good.

Astonishing that the supposed experts at 
@windowscentral.com
 would fall for this line, when it's obviously a grey/dark-pattern approach that fails to recognise under 18s can access credit cards as easily as any other method to bypass the protections (except maybe multi-angle face scanning)

As for the "just as Valve is doing with its checks. I'm disappointed that Xbox is pushing a method that involves handing over identifying data to a company you know nothing about."...
We know A LOT more publicly about how Yoti handles data, than we do about how Valve does it.

From a professional software engineering experience position, this is a lack of management responsibility and at-best a resistant-compliance approach, that puts more responsibility on the user, is _more_ easily circumvented and less effective than other, more qualified and certified solutions.

"Oh your kid stole your credit card to download porn and ~nazi games?!? Nothing to do with us Mom, maybe you should have hidden your credit card better".

Found that there is a mention of this identified as a workaround, in this case raised in an earlier paragraph, by Yoti. If Steam are not verifying the credit entry was made by the owner of the card (have no idea _how_ they would do that), may not be compliant. www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/r...

It's unsurprising that Yoti raised these weaknesses with Ofcom (it being in their business interests to point out their model is both more effective and more secure than Steam's chosen 'weak' approach), but it has the benefit of being true.

The more I read of the act and the processes/diligence, the more confidence I have in OSA, not just objectives, but also its attempt to get as close to effective as one might reasonably expect. To revisit a post I wrote weeks ago "Effectiveness is optional now", the 'public opinion' is pessimistic

From one perspective, it IS quite an aggressive privacy over-reach compared to usual Tory policy of "do whatever the fuck you want, not our problem", but the result _mostly_ makes sense as a cross-party outcome of 6 years, and has had its harmful edges shaved off through responsible iterations.

The >3m users before enforcement is great too.
They shifted a lot of responsibility onto corpos who can afford it, and I hope Labour pick-up the slightly sticky wicket and use it to fine the places that don't keep up, for genuinely leaving the doors wide open for monsters to get at British kids.

#### ChatGPT:
Got it logged. This thread gives you plenty of material you could:  

- **Work into the existing OSA explainer** — it would slot neatly into the “Businesses gonna business” section as a worked case study, contrasting Steam’s weak “credit card = verified” method with certified providers like Yoti. That way you build on your earlier point about lazy/dark-pattern compliance.  
- **Make a standalone post** — “Steam’s Fake Age Checks Under the OSA” or similar. That would let you go harder on Valve, WindowsCentral, and the wider pattern of resistant compliance.  

The good bits to carry across are:  
- Valve’s “dinosaur-corpse rat-king of tech-debt” excuse.  
- The comparison of how much more transparent Yoti actually is, versus Valve.  
- Your point that certified providers already raised these weaknesses with Ofcom, so it’s not just opinion.  
- The framing that this is *more* easily circumvented than a proper verifier, despite being spun as “safe.”  
- The kicker: “Oh your kid stole your credit card to download porn and nazi games?! Nothing to do with us Mom…” — that captures the accountability dodge.  

Would you like me to sketch a clean “Steam explainer” section for your existing OSA post so you can see how it integrates, or draft it as a standalone piece you could post separately if you decide it deserves its own headline?
