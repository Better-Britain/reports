You can find reasoning for its changes at the end. I thought it might make an interesting contrast.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog. It’s generally gone well, but I want to raise some points…\n\nRewording Issues\nIt’s extremely aggressive when it comes to rewording. I often have to say “use my words” or “stick to my phrasing” three or four times before it stops turning whatever I said into mulch. In GPT-5’s latest 'quick’ mode (basically GPT-3) it’s extremely lazy, so statements like “really THINK about it” or just waiting for lower load times, when it’s more likely to use 'thinking’ mode, seem to help.\n\nGiving it my original text with each repeated imperative, or explaining why I said something in a particular way, can help. But there are things it just doesn’t like: run-on sentences (even those I use for rhythm, humour, or stress) often get chopped into nonsense, and intentional misuse of grammar… well, it really hates that.\n\nConnective Tissue\nIt does a decent job of 'connective tissue.’ If I write a skeet rant as a draft and copy it in, then after I’m done forcing it not to change my phrasing, it can turn it into a post with some flow. But I tend to think between the lines, and my earlier posts read more like 5–7 standalone paragraphs than one coherent piece.\n\nIt’s not as 'fun’ as writing alone, but sometimes useful. Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\n\nTone and Audience\nIt has a decent sense of tone. If I say “fucking terrible policy,” it usually knows I’m exaggerating for effect, but will almost always suggest toning it down. I don’t mind alienating readers: good-faith readers can work with their own emotions, and I’m not interested in writing for bad-faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\n\nEarlier posts on this blog show more empty, corpo-feeling language — back when I hadn’t yet learned how to force it to keep my words, but without the unintentional digs at readers that actually do make people switch off.\n\nResearch Value\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode), it’s invaluable — almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is too steep). You have to tell it to cite sources, specify what sources are acceptable (I avoid newspapers except as support), and enforce rules like “multiple claims can’t rely on one source.” The best sources are researchers, government agencies, universities, and primary datasets — not opinion pieces.\n\nChatGPT and Grok vary a lot. I prefer ChatGPT’s final output, but Grok is excellent for critique. I’ll often ask it for a second opinion with phrases like “tear the arsehole out of this blog post” or “severely criticise this claim, with evidence.”\n\nRed Flags\nA lot of people I’ve talked to (or watched using it) are aware of its limitations, but there are problems:\n\nPeople give their preferred LLM too much agency, lifting responses wholesale without really reading them.\nThey talk about the model as if it “understood” or “felt” things.\nThe press leaves a fog of “stupid” opinions about AI out in the wild, misrepresenting what it does and when to use it.\nNeurodivergence and Flow\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD). When I used to write directly into my dash, I’d often lose the plot halfway: either brain fog or rabbit-holing into tangents. I still do this, but the AI helps me check: “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? Are all the sections connected?” Sometimes it helps me split a messy article into two clearer ones.\n\nSpeed and Structure\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about quality. But it’s too eager to push you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response discourages sitting with a piece. My earlier posts are more like quick takes; now I prefer slower, deeper posts with sources.\n\nPraise and Phrasing\nChatGPT in particular loves to praise you. Even with project voice settings, it’s unavoidable. I once tried to cut the first and last paragraph of every response with a userscript, but the HTML made it unreliable. My workaround: ignore the fluff. The prompt should come from me, and the judgment of success should too. The more you let it take control, the further you drift from meaningful content.\n\nSwearing actually helps. If I swear at it, it follows instructions more closely and does more work. For one project, some of my logs (usually at high-load times) include things like: “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction], like I said, you dick…” It’s partly venting, partly effective. (And no, I would never speak to an actual colleague like that.)\n\nCommunity Use\nIn neurodivergent spaces, I see a lot of people using ChatGPT, sometimes well, sometimes poorly. It’s easy to spot when someone didn’t work their input enough. If you use a free/cheap model, don’t expect much. Even under Plus, GPT-3 and Claude have been lazy since Agent mode got mainstream. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs — not by criticising them for using the tool, but by showing what it does well and what it doesn’t.\n\nReactions to AI Writing\nSome people will dismiss any content they think is AI-written, even when it isn’t. On Reddit, I’ve seen the default retort: “AI slop, garbage opinion.” That’s just lazy. I wrote earlier about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people are writing like AI now — easy-reading rhythm, low-bar accessibility, short paragraphs.\n\nMy Current Use\nSo far, I’m happy using it for:\n\nTesting the strength of a claim\nSuggesting simpler phrasing for complex issues\nBut I’d avoid prompts like “Rewrite this in the style of X,” because it almost never delivers what I want.\n\nFinal Thought\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (I’ve already seen it pushed in corporates I know). But as a workflow tool — used carefully, only for what it’s good at — it’ll stay in my toolbox for now.\n\nEdits the AI made (in ChatGPT’s own words)\nHere’s the reasoning behind the minimal changes I made, stripped of the structural stuff (headings, spacing, etc.):\n\nClarified dense sentences: a few run-ons were split just enough to preserve rhythm without losing meaning (e.g. “mulch” instead of “much,” trimming the overstacked commas).\nRemoved duplicates/repetition: you circled back to some points (like praise-padding, rewording aggression, connective tissue) multiple times; I left them once, where they landed strongest.\nLight wording polish: fixed a couple of small slips that looked accidental rather than intentional (“mulch” vs “much,” “arshole” → “arsehole”), but left deliberate quirks intact.\nContext clues: added a single explanatory aside where an acronym (AuDHD) might throw readers unfamiliar with it.\nTone preservation: all the swearing, snark, and exaggeration stayed — I only smoothed where it risked confusing the point rather than sharpening it.\nThe AI version isn’t “nicer,” it’s just trimmed of redundancies and cleaned of unintentional noise, while leaving your intended noise (humour, rhythm, tangents) intact.\n\nMy 'take’\nThese changes are generally reasonable, except where it dropped a couple of entire points (probably to satisfy its word limiter), you may prefer one or the other, but I try to land somewhere in the middle. I don’t like how LLMs take off ALL the sharp edges, but that is definitely a utility I find useful sometimes.\n\nI’ve recently been using it to write in-depth research reports and important feedback and complaints (like to my GP, mentioned in an earlier blog post). Used as a tool, not a lifestyle, I’m comfortable endorsing AI more broadly, and hope with my upcoming project to highlight some of this value, especially in complex comms, to others in future.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai, #communication\nPosted 21 hours ago with 1 note\nOn a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’\nThis is the entirely handwritten version of this post, you can read: On a few months of writing with an AI 'assistant’ (AI tweaked version) here.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog, there’s an old post about it down there somewhere.

Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft… [draft]” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\nIt’s got a reasonable sense of tone, like it knows that if I say “fucking terrible policy” that I’m exaggerating to make a point, but does almost always suggest toning it down to avoid alienating readers. I don’t mind alienating readers, because a good faith reader can use their own emotions to continue digesting a piece, and I’m not interested in writing for bad faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\nIf you scroll down to the earlier posts on this 'blog’, you can see the emptier/corpo language, because I hadn’t learned how to make it say what I said, but without the problematic emotional states that actually do cause readers to check out (like unintentionally criticising the reader themselves).\nThe word-soup feeling diminishes as I added more of my existing articles and more content written directly by me to the project, and as I added more chats, especially because ChatGPT projects now correctly contextualise text files and chats on a project, including instructions.\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode) it’s really invaluable, almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is just a little too steep). You absolutely have to tell it to cite sources, which sources are acceptable (I generally advise no newspaper stories except as support), and how multiple claims shouldn’t rely on a single source, and how authoritative sources come from researchers, government agencies, universities and other primary datasets, not from opinion pieces (except where the research is looking for opinions).\nChatGPT and Grok vary wildly on specific subjects, and I tend to prefer the final output from ChatGPT, but Grok is very good at criticising content, so I’ll often ask it for a 'second opinion’, including phrases like 'tear the arsehole out of this blog post’ or 'severely criticise this claim, citing reasons with evidence’.\nI’ve talked with quite a few people (and seen some using it directly) about how they use these tools, and generally people (at least the people I know) are aware of the limitations and opportunities of these tools, but there are some red flags… a) People give their preferred LLM far too much agency, not only in how they parse and use responses (often just lifting content and barely even reading it before shipping it) but in how they express how the engine understood or felt about the issue. and b) The way the press cover it leaves a lot of 'stupid’ opinions about how AI works out in the wild… often massively misrepresenting what it can do and when to use it.\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD) so when I used to write in my own dash directly, I’d get half-way into an article and lose the plot completely… either through brain-fog, or just through rabbit-holing into a tangent (probably my most difficult-to-overcome behaviour). I still do this in the posts I’m writing myself, but it does come in handy when I’m done writing to ask something like “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? are all the sections connected?” and it’s occasionally helped me take a single piece that gets lost in the middle, and turn that into 2 pieces that each have a little less to say, but better capture and communicate the subject.\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about the quality of results, but it’s really eager to get you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response really discourages chewing over a piece, and my earlier posts demonstrate that. They’re basically just 'takes’, and while I don’t mind posting a take here or there, I prefer the depth of the longer form posts with various supporting citations.\nI also wrote about how ChatGPT in particular loves to celebrate you, give you a pat on the back for being such a smart boy… I’ve tried to mitigate that by setting my project voice, but it’s basically unavoidable. I even tried writing a userscript that cuts off the first and last paragraph of every response, but finding the right HTML elements proved impossible to do reliably. Just don’t read the first and last paragraph of any response from any model, use your old-school banner-blindness. The prompt should always be coming from you, and what you thought about how well it did what you asked for. Every time you let it take control, you can only get further away from valuable/meaningful content.\nSwearing actually fucking helps. When you swear at the engine, it takes your instructions more seriously, makes it slightly less lazy, and aside from the word “THINK” under GPT-5, is one of the few ways to get it to do more real work, and more closely follow what you told it to do. For my main current project, some of my chat logs (mostly from high-load times like Saturday morning) say things like “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction] , like I said, you dick… [claim]”, partly cos it feels good to vent, and it’s a computer so who cares (I would not speak to a human like this, and never ever have. I worked with a guy who did early in my career and he indirectly taught me that’s a terrible way to work, even for a hardcore utilitarian), but also because it really does do a better job in the response.\nThere’s mixed positions on please and thank you. The platforms would rather you didn’t (it does cost them for every response, they’d prefer you to be utilitarian), but realistically the cost is minimal, and when it’s delivering well, it makes _me_ feel better to treat it like a co-writer I respect, so I tend to communicate with it in much the same way I did when I hired freelancers (basically it ate their job, as I no longer have a virtual assistant to pickup my more mundane tasks).\nI’ve noticed a lot of other people in generally 'neurodivergent’ (man, I hate that term, for its 'othering’) spaces using ChatGPT especially, some more than others, and while many are getting real value from being able to construct and analyse complex thoughts with relatively low effort; it’s easy to see when some people didn’t really work their input enough. If you use a cheap/free model, do NOT expect good results. Even under Plus, GPT3 and Claude have been particularly stupid/lazy since the rise of Agent mode on mainstream platforms. It’s no wonder OpenAI decided to just mash their models together under a marshall and call it GPT-5. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs when you see it, not by criticising them for using the tool but by helping them understand what it does well and what it doesn’t.\nMy last major point, is some people will be triggered by any form of AI writing, even if it’s not writing output by an AI. I noticed this especially on reddit, a common retort, even for non-AI based content is something like “low quality AI slop is just a garbage opinion”, but I think that’s just a lazy go-to, as I think one of my earlier posts was about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people started writing like AI for real, because aside from the hypnotic rhythm of its paragraphs, it generally writes text that is easy to digest, especially if you set a lower reading ease.\nOn progress so far, I’m pretty happy with my general use of it in use cases like “Test the strength of this claim” or “Suggest some ways to express this complex issue in plain English”, but I’d probably avoid in future just saying “Rewrite this in the style of these”, because it rarely just gives you what you actually want.\n\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (as I’ve already seen it being pushed on corpos I know), but as a general quality and workflow tool, used only for what it’s good at, it’ll stay in my toolbox for a while.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai\nPosted 23 hours ago\nJournalists making rage, not change\nThis barely researched news story landed on the r/manchester reddit from the guardian yesterday: English councils pay private landlords millions in incentives to house homeless families\n\nimage\nStories like this with no sense of scale always leave me wondering what they _really_ mean, beyond being clickbait, so I looked into it…\n\nFor scope… I’m primarily interested in Manchester (I live here, and they have many more occurences than any other listed region), only in other regions insofar as they compare to Manchester.\n\nI went to the source (Generation Rent) and opened up their data on a computer (since the xlsx-html hide column headers on mobile), switched to the real xlsx and got the headings “Council - Occasions paid an incentive - £ paid in incentives - Highest incentive (£)”. This gives us an average £2958 per ‘occasion paid an incentive’.\n\nWith a max payment of £5980, suggesting a fairly low spread, but can’t find info on exactly who was paid what or when, so 90% of those could have gone to single landlord (unlikely, but possible) over 1138 'occasions’ (best guess, that’s 1138 people or families homed by a landlord who otherwise wouldn’t have let to them because of uncertainty).\n\nFor comparison, the total fund would buy 13-14 'average’ Manchester houses, to bring back into public ownership, or could maybe build 15-20 new houses owned publicly from scratch.\n\nI also put together a 'rough’ estimate of distribution based on reported figures just to inform context.\n\nFor total cost per resident, in Manchester, that’s about £6 each, or ~0.3% of council tax bill funded these incentives. This is slightly less than Enfield (the highest), about the same as Ealing, a little more than Nottingham, and substantially more than Birmingham (£1.45 tho I think that has a larger rural/suburban catchment area where these don’t really apply). London is around £5 per resident.\n\nThe original FOI for Manchester from Generation Rent is here. The wording suggests those occasions paid for 1131 people/families to be homed, but it is unclear about the details, I suspect it would need more FOIs to clarify.\n\n[imo] that seems mostly reasonable to me, but the total spend does support Generation Rent’s case that councils need more tools to use, 0.3% of total council tax paid isn’t nothing, but it’s not a 'tear down the council’ or 'eat all private landlords’ scale problem. Even if a small proportion of the 1000+ people or families are not sleeping on the streets, that’s a pretty good way to spend council money to avoid having to setup a thunderdome :)\n\nAs an unrelated aside, whenever you see “£X MILLIONS” in a headline… if the body of the article doesn’t contain some kind of per-capita or per-subject breakdown, that’s a journalistic failure, usually with the side-effect of creating outrage instead of communicating meaning. The Guardian used to be better than this, cos this type of headline especially belongs in a tabloid, not a real newspaper. Real data makes for real positive outcomes.\n\nWhy does this matter? Surely it’s just a nitpick? What does it matter if the scale isn’t reported? It’s still £3.35m, right?\nIt’s a fairly easy scale to identify, how many people did this money help home? Now we have at least a vague idea.\nIt also helps us identify what other solutions this could afford, and whether they would beat the current outcomes.\nIf you already got 'all the facts’ (or as many as you can), even if the facts don’t support your desired outcomes quite as enthusiastically as you’d prefer, you still have a case that’s harder to tear down or ignore.\nIt prevents readers lazily skipping to conclusions like “ban all private landlords” or “stop the council spending this money”, that make them feel better about complaining, but would harm real home-seekers if the council suddenly had to stop incentivising, but the actual proposal by Generation Rent was not actioned. If you solved the loud problem and not the quiet one, you just made a bigger problem for everybody.\nIt prevents (or at least discourages) 'ragers’ taking up all the oxygen, like on our original reference, the reddit thread. You can find this story in other city subreddits, and I expect on facebook too, with the same kneejerk reactions at various intensities. Placing the problem in context is crucial, or people will take whatever they want from your data, and you will have no way to stop them misrepresenting your objective or the positive outcomes.\nIt’s the right thing to do, even if it makes me look like a dick for nitpicking on bluesky :)\nTagged: #manchester, #council, #guardian, #journalistic malpractice, #ragebait, #clickbait, #journalism, #lazy, #renters, #council tax, #manchester city council\nPosted 2 days ago\nAI commercials don’t think you’re dumb, they’re just lying, legally\nAI ads are weird. Every time you see one, it’s an unimaginably low-stakes scenario: “learn some football bants”, “summarise an email”, “identify this fish”, “help me write a cute little note”. Exchanges so meaningless and empty, you wouldn’t even think to ask them.\n\nNobody actually uses gen AI like that, and everyone knows it, including the advertisers and platform decision-makers. People make fun of them as if the agencies are just clueless, like they genuinely believe the killer app for generative AI is party small talk. But that’s not what’s happening…\n\nThey can’t say what you actually use AI for. They can’t suggest “ask it about your mental health” or “do deep research on why my state just made this new draconian law” or “how do I expand my small business?” or even “how do I answer this email without sounding like a dickhead” and “my partner does this annoying thing, how do I deal with it?” (all common and well-recorded use cases, no moral judgment intended), because the moment they do, they open the entire organisation up to legal action. Visit the subreddit for basically any neurodiversity or mental-health issue, and you’ll find post after post of people using ChatGPT to deal with their problems, or just to feel better after a hard day, often with positive results. The corpos selling these genuinely useful services can’t focus on those though, because that comes with far more baggage than the organisation is willing to carry.\n\nHere are some examples: Google’s Gemini Super Bowl run with “Dream Job” and “Party Blitz” (The Verge, Google blog), Microsoft’s Copilot “Your everyday AI companion” Super Bowl ad and its “conversation starters” demos (CBS News, YouTube), Meta’s Ray-Ban Meta glasses Super Bowl campaign with Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt and the cringey “Parent Presentation” spot they pulled almost instantly (Meta, People, TidBITS, The Verge, Business Insider), OpenAI’s “The Intelligence Age” Super Bowl debut (OpenAI, Adweek, The Verge), and Anthropic’s five-second Claude bumper during the 2024 game (Axios).\n\nAI companies like to pretend that their biggest problem is “sometimes our responses contain innaccurate or out of date information”, and hedge/disclaim that right next to the main input textbox, and that’s generally what the press and outrage crowds tend to focus on how the AI can’t generate an accurate diagram of the female reproductive system, for example, but the real potential for harm of AI comes from when it technically can deliver information, but perhaps it shouldn’t, or even if it should, it’s still trusting you, the meatspace-based human, to action or implement based on its information reasonably, and not get mad (or litigious) if it all goes wrong.\n\nAn LLM can tell you to eat rocks, and that’s obviously stupid, but if it tells you to swallow your feelings and get on with your depressing job (even if it hedges a little), or you ask it about something uncomplicated, and its pursuit of balance or of avoiding being contentious/edgy responds with some advice that sounds good but isn’t if you think about it (because it’s trained largely on reddit/quora/etc which are full of terrible advice of their own forms), that’s an output of the system the organisation becomes liable for. So ads just pick the lowest possible stakes and pretend that’s all you’d ever use it for. If you use it for something else, that’s entirely on you.\n\nAI commercials don’t think you’re stupid, their internal data definitely shows them clearly what users are asking for, and if anything I suspect whoever at the marketing agency who puts these things out has said “people know what AI can actually do, they know these things would never happen like this” in a quiet meeting. I’d even bet the lawyers signing off on these ads know exactly what they’re doing, but as long as nobody admits it, there’s an entire system of legal defense that just keeps comfortably rolling along, trying to find new ways of taking your money by providing an always-on ‘e-friend’ who solves all your problems.\n\nTagged: #ai, #ads, #generative ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #gemini, #meta ai, #apple intelligence, #commercials, #marketing, #liability, #lawsuits, #bullshit, #lonliness, #lonely, #mental health\nPosted 3 days ago\nEveryone’s Wrong About How AI Works (Including Me)\nSo many people are so confidently wrong about how AI works that it actually makes me more confident the models’ own confidently-wrong output is based on real human input. They’re just reflecting us back at ourselves — smug mistakes in, smug mistakes out.\n\nAnd yeah, I’m in that pool too. I’ll happily waffle on about prompt clarity and outputs under load, and I’m happy to point and laugh at the vagina museum confidently claiming “That’s how LLMs work” in the middle of a thirty or forty tweet thread where every single post is weighed down with their own hallucinations and imaginative explanations with absolutely no connection to reality, because while everyone loves the vagina museum enough for tens of thousands of people to retweet and like their nonsense, literally nobody in their audience has any real idea how the tech works beyond ‘magic box that obviously can’t draw the female reproductive system’, because of course it can’t, that’s not what it’s for.\n\nI like to think (in a lazy crutch kind of way) of LLMs like a bag of scrabble tiles, and especially with images, you tip out the pieces and get mad that it doesn’t spell antidisestablishmentarianism, cos you’re pretty sure you put all the letters in.\n\nSometimes I think the most plausible explanation is that LLMs are just portals into some parallel dimension where an infinite sweatshop of overworked gig-econony ghostwriters are cranking out all our mediocre replies in some frozen time-space continuum. Honestly, if we discovered that tomorrow, nobody would even blink — it’d feel about right cos that’s how we build everything already anyway.\n\nAnd if we’re all going to be confidently wrong, maybe I should just choose to believe the whole thing runs on a single haunted qubit forming an einstein-rosen bridge in a basement somewhere. At least that’s a fun lie, and it’s not much more ridiculous than the reality of gazillions of grains of sand computing probability tables until they hit boundary conditions that collapse into a picture of a lizard lady with three tits or a screed about how AI works.\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #generativeai, #confidentlywrong, #altreality, #shitpost, #techhumour, #dead internet, #vibes, #rant, #skeets, #lol\nPosted 3 days ago\nOn the joy of being a bit of a dick to solve problems\nHad a couple of good work days, had a few projects come together into a cohesive set, and discovered I’m a pretty competent script-writer when I take the time to do a proper job — and the icing on the cake… My neighbour just told me she’s finally getting rid of her fucking cockerel. \\o/ [coming up Milhouse dot gif]\n\nAs a bonus: after weeks on a strict diet of mostly potatoes and bean mash, I’ve got snacks again 🤤\n\nAt the start of the year I promised myself I’d stop ignoring the little things that make life worse. Stop listening to the voice that says “just tolerate it, don’t be a dick.” Instead: fix them, nudge, ask, push a bit. Nothing massive, but just trying to solve these things is starting to pay off and my internal “am I being a dick?” counter has barely ticked up.\n\nIf I have any advice for tackling problems that aren’t your fault (those are a bit harder) it’s this: show people the evidence. A simple graph or log can make it obvious who the real dickhead is, and that’s harder to argue with than just venting.\n\nThe next project is pulling together GP practice reviews across a dozen sites run by the same management company, and comparing them to their competitors. Because sometimes the way you get change isn’t by ranting — it’s by drawing a chart that makes everyone else realise just how badly they’re failing, as long as you can present it in a way you’re confident is helpful and informative, and not just ranting.\n\nSometimes fixing life isn’t about grand revolutions. Sometimes it’s about fewer 5 a.m. cock-a-doodle-dos, and finally getting crisps back in your life. Small fixes, big difference.\n\nTagged: #small wins, #everyday life, #attention economy, #self maintenance, #fixing things, #mental health, #energy management, #petty victories, #bean mash life, #crisps, #neighbours, #sleep, #life hacks, #problem solving\nPosted 3 days ago\nAI doesn’t suck because the tech is bad\nAI doesn’t suck because it’s bad technology. On a good day, with low load, it’s barely distinguishable from magic. It sucks because its incredible power is so easy for people to use against you. All the stuff you’ve left online — the posts, the scraps, the off-hand comments — that’s ammo. And nobody else is going to clean it up. You have to.\n\nIf you’ve got any kind of digital footprint, try it. Open any LLM in a private chat, switch memory/history off, and just ask it about you. That’s the surface-level stuff it already knows. But if you really want to see what it can do, gather your posts like a scammer would, feed them in, and ask it to make assumptions. What do I like? What am I insecure about? What would I fall for? It doesn’t take much.\n\nChatGPT used to try and block this. It would stall or redirect. But since Grok launched, the guardrails have thinned out, and you can do it on either one now. The system message technically says “no personal data about anyone unless it’s public and relevant.” But that’s not an and, it’s an or. Make it public, or argue it’s relevant, and the model plays along. Strip out names, call it fiction, drop in a fake world — it still works. Those rules don’t protect you. They protect the platform’s lawyers.\n\nThis isn’t new either. The same advice applied back in 2011. I built a system for a major media org that scraped and connected data about their users and their families the old-fashioned way. We called it “the Facebook you don’t know you’re part of,” and eventually convinced management to kill it. For scope: the whole point was to sell cars to the wealthiest identifiable member of any household, based on their share history and a handful of behavioural assumptions. Off six or seven data points, it got the hierarchy right about ninety percent of the time. You are leaky.\n\nAnd here’s the thing: our system didn’t even need social media, and it only took a few devs a few months to build. Then one day we added a small feature that suddenly made it so invasive we all just looked at each other and realised we couldn’t ship it. Because the org wasn’t evil, management agreed. It was disturbingly easy to build, and could have been a secret nightmare. I still remember the look on one manager’s face when we explained it — we made it sound difficult and expensive, but he was excited anyway. Most of the rest were horrified. Luckily there were too many layers of management to ship it then, but plenty of others in companies all over the world picked up the baton and sprinted full pelt until they couldn’t sprint any faster… then they needed more, and now we have LLMs.\n\nI haven’t tried (yet), but I reckon with the right phrasing to avoid the weak guardrails (pretend you only want to build it about yourself maybe), you could ask Grok to recreate the whole thing today. And it’d probably do a decent job on the very first try — especially if you had a specific target in mind.\n\nSo yeah. The tech works. It’s almost magic when it isn’t under load. That’s the problem though, if you don’t clean up your trail, the techbros are going to ingest it (if they haven’t already) and it’s going to follow you, because your info is being worked into the models beneath the models (GPT-5 already layering on top of old models, and as above, so below, you’re stuffed in the catacombs). It’s not like google search where you can just file a request to have your database row deleted, there’s no getting it out, what you have online today is what you’ll be known for, forever.\n\nGPT-5 system messages, ish\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #grok, #chatgpt, #privacy, #dead internet, #data, #safety, #tech rant, #generative ai, #communication, #genai, #politics, #personal data\nPosted 3 days ago with 3 notes\nNobody at YouTube Watches YouTube\nI know this because of something so stupid it borders on parody. The YouTube TV app — which is basically the same web client everywhere now — still doesn’t remember if you want subtitles on. Every single time you open it, or even when it nudges you to re-select your profile after being idle, you have to go dig into menus, find the CC toggle they’ve buried deeper with each redesign, and turn captions back on.\n\nIn 2025, in homes where kids are running around, people are multitasking, and half the viewing is with the volume down, subtitles aren’t an “edge case.” They’re baseline. They’re also not just about convenience — they’re about accessibility. If you’re hard of hearing, you literally can’t use the app properly without turning CC on every time. That’s not a quirk. That’s a broken product.\n\nAnd it’s not like this hasn’t been raised. Hard-of-hearing communities have been complaining to deaf ears (lol) for years. Anyone who watches TV with captions would notice in about thirty seconds. There are at least thirty or forty real people in the YouTube product and design chain who could have caught this, flagged it, or fixed it with probably a single line of code. Instead, it’s been ignored, and in their latest “big refresh” they somehow made it worse.\n\nWhich leads me back to the claim. If even one decision-maker at YouTube — from the lowest PM to the highest-paid boardroom executive — actually relied on captions at home, this wouldn’t still be a problem. The only plausible explanation is that none of them do. That’s the only way something this obvious survives multiple product cycles.\n\nAnd that’s what really gets me. As a designer, it’s not just annoying — it’s insulting. It’s a reminder that the platform with a monopoly on so much creative culture is run by people who don’t use it the way most of us do. The people making the calls aren’t living with the same pain points, so those problems never get solved. They’re invisible at the top, glaring everywhere else.\n\nAnd sure — in the grand scheme of YouTube’s endless list of backwards decisions and neglected features, this is a small one. But it’s also telling. If they can’t be bothered to fix the basics, what chance is there they’ll tackle the bigger failures?\n\nSomeone really does need to disrupt YouTube.\n\nTagged: #youtube, #design, #accessibility, #enshittification, #subtitles, #rant, #deafawareness, #deafculture, #hard of hearing\nPosted 6 days ago\nCrypto Seems Stupid, But It Solves a Problem (Just Probably Not for You, Yet)\nCrypto as an industry is stupid. Let’s get that out of the way. It’s a clown car of scams, cult vibes, and half-baked libertarian fantasies about freedom without responsibility. It is, in the broadest sense, ridiculous.\n\nBut here’s the awkward bit: it actually does solve a problem. Just not your problem. At least, not yet.\n\nThe Problem Nobody Wants to Admit\nThe money layer of the internet isn’t neutral. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal — these aren’t just pipes you can pour payments through. They’re gatekeepers, and they know it. They’ve cut off porn platforms. They’ve throttled sex educators. They’ve quietly shut down queer creators, kink communities, even writers who looked too adjacent to the “wrong” politics.\n\nAnd now it’s games too — recent reporting shows Steam and Itch have both been pressured by payment processors (last I read, they denied it). Even entirely normal hustles and small creators get hit, sometimes just for TOS violations or false flags. People lose their income overnight, with no recourse, because some fringe product or anonymous report tripped a system designed to protect the most powerful customers, not the real people using it.\n\nWhy Crypto Looks Like the Wrong Answer\nCrypto has earned its reputation. Scams, pump-and-dumps, rug-pulls, and plenty of users who talk like failed cult leaders. It’s been lumped in with the dark web since the start. While it does enable shady stuff, it doesn’t have to enable only that.\n\nAnd despite the myths, most crypto isn’t really anonymous; they’re pseudonymous. Every transaction is public, forever. If investigators already have a thread, they can pull it.\n\nThen there’s the energy debate. Proof-of-work mining is wasteful, sure — but newer tokens don’t drink the ocean. Even with the worst offenders, the problem often comes down to bad infrastructure and perverse incentives. Companies like Nvidia have no reason to reinvent chips when the old ones sell fine. The system rewards inefficiency because that’s what pays.\n\n…But It Does Fix This One\nHere’s the rub: if you’re a sex worker suddenly cut off from payment processors, or a queer creator flagged as “brand unsafe,” or someone whose platform got kneecapped because Stripe panicked about “reputational risk,” crypto might be your only option left standing.\n\nStablecoins in particular are boring, which is exactly what you want from money. They let people send and receive without begging permission from a boardroom of executives who’ve never heard of you and wouldn’t admit they canceled you even if you asked. Yes, the current US administration is fumbling regulation in a way that makes stablecoins look like just another scam coin. But some form of responsible regulation would be welcome — and overdue.\n\nAnd you don’t have to use Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or whatever fresh coin the nerds are yelling about this week (hint, it’s 99.9% probably a scamcoin if it’s come out in the last few years). As long as everyone involved agrees it’s pretty stable, or you’re in and out quickly (or comfortable holding volatility in your pocket), any token will do. The nerds deserve mockery for their blind optimism, but they’re not entirely wrong that used responsibly, it has value.\n\nThe “Yet”\nMaybe that’s not your problem. Maybe you’ve got a regular job, a respectable bank account, and no reason to worry about whether your income stream will vanish overnight because some corpo compliance reviewer didn’t like the shape of your business.\n\nBut the choke point isn’t theoretical. It’s already here. Entire groups are being financially deplatformed right now. Maybe you don’t need crypto — until suddenly you do.\n\nPay Attention\nNobody’s asking you to jump in with both feet. But understand what it actually is because maybe one day you’ll need it — or maybe a creator you like will get cut off, and you’ll want a way to slip them some support.\n\nThis matters more as platforms corporate-ize. YouTube, Twitch, Patreon — all of them focus on fewer, bigger players once the VC money takes the reins. It happened in microstock: the floor kept rising until most contributors were shoved into the basement to fight over scraps.\n\nCrypto isn’t utopia. It won’t buy you coffee at Starbucks anytime soon (or at least not outside of the valley). But for all its absurdity, it’s one of the very few escape hatches left in a financial system that wants everything channeled between two high walls, sterile and market-ready, like pigs driven to slaughter.\n\nYou don’t have to like it. You don’t even have to use it. But it already exists, and it already works. It costs you basically nothing to understand the option — and you might be glad you did.\n\nTagged: #crypto, #cryptocurrency, #bitcoin, #ethereum, #stablecoins, #fintech, #financial censorship, #deplatformed, #payment processors, #mutual aid, #swers, #sexwork, #queer creators, #adult content, #censorship, #platform politics, #compliance capitalism, #tech rant\nPosted 1 week ago\nWhy you should use AI for art\nGen AI’s uptake has been wild, even though it’s far from a perfect tool. It’s already fucked over a million or more commercial artists worldwide by swamping every once-viable digital content market with slop. And it’s not just because the tools are bad—most “hustlers” trying to make hay while the sun shines (think markets like KDP, POD, or microstock, though the last one’s less “swamped” and more out-competed by free crappy images of whatever you can imagine) haven’t really reacted to the influx yet.\n\nMy main issue isn’t with AI adoption overall. I think it’s been over-adopted long before it’s actually good, but it is already occasionally useful when deployed in the right places and the right ways—as a tool that multiplies force, not as a worker replacement.\n\nThe problem’s with the irresponsible adoption: platforms that can’t tell the difference between slop and real value, and the absence of systems to determine that, because they’re too busy trying to leverage gen AI themselves, and not busy enough preventing exploitation by it. Eventually, those platforms will have to catch up or die.\n\nThere’s an argument about gen AI where it doesn’t belong, like spewing bullshit onto social media. But the biggest problem isn’t that they “stole” literally every image they could find to build the systems in the first place—regulators are now letting them get away with it, because it technically doesn’t violate copyright.\n\nCopyright’s on the exact words you used, not the style of words you tend toward; on the exact brush strokes, not your general use of phthalo blue (or however you spell it) and a palette knife. Likewise, intellectual property is the names and places in your world, not that you tend to set scenes in space with a big-titted lizard lady and a talking cat. People got mad at something nobody saw coming, so it’s not surprising there weren’t really any tools to stop it.\n\nAnyway, onto my story.\nThe short version: once upon a time, I was a microstock photographer and illustrator (a mediocre one, that’s fine, not everybody has to be Picasso). Eventually, loosely a video-illustrator of sorts (shaders to video). Going into around 2016 with somewhere near 10,000 pieces of content in my portfolio—not exactly earning a strong living, but earning enough to have been worth the time to make them. Well, microstock fell off a cliff (at least for me and everyone except the top 3% of producers) as the market consolidated (I won’t get into microstock history, but it was once a thriving industry). The better producers out-competed me (fairly), the agencies hoovered up or destroyed each other, and Unsplash and co came along and took the edge cases and convenience users, dropping my income to 20% of the peak. Even after adding 15,000 videos or so to my portfolio, that started okay, then dipped too as the agencies who ingested it struggled to keep them relevant or I got outcompeted in their algorithms.\n\nSo I shifted into print on demand. I lost track of how many designs in my portfolios years ago, but I’m pretty sure it’s at least half a million overall, maybe more—I honestly have no idea. My designs are basic, but I made them all myself, with the aid of scripts and tools I built, and put in the legwork to tag them and upload them. They paid a little… until gen AI came along (what, like 2021?) and bam, all of a sudden print on demand wasn’t viable cos every store—Cafepress, Teepublic, Redbubble, Spreadshirt, Zazzle, and I’m sure half a dozen I’ve forgotten—all got swamped by pretty poor quality, but technically passable free upsized Stable Diffusion characters with too many fingers and not enough characters in the text. But customers aren’t that bothered if all they want is a mug that says “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my morning cock” for less than twenty bucks. So POD dropped to 10% of its peak too (maybe less by now, I don’t bother to check anymore)…\n\nI actively encourage artists, especially those who once earned a real living, to use whatever AI tools they want or need to—to make up for their loss in sales, to leverage for more work, for happier clients, for faster throughput. Because commercial art isn’t always about being the best; it’s often just about getting enough work done in each new day to keep the lights on and the Photoshop subscription paid (I’ll cover this another day).\n\nWhen these whining kids on social media get triggered by a lazy article that has a “not just x, but y” conceit or an image of Sonic with too many fingers (does Sonic even have fingers?), because they feel like it stole their furry fan art from those 2 images they were proud of posting on Tumblr 10 years ago, I don’t give a fuck…\n\nThe entire market for commercial art got wiped out time and time again, and people have been stealing my images on the internet this entire millennium, and I never complained about it because that’s what the internet is. It’s stealing the Sonic IP so you can have him kissing a real girl in your lazy fanfic if you want to. And getting triggered at regular people just discovering the joy of creation for the first time—because they weren’t raised with enough time or energy to get into making their own work when they were entitled kids…\n\nI say let them make whatever trash they want with AI, let Disney cram it into every corner they want to, and I’ll gladly look at and maybe even enjoy it, because art isn’t just the execution, art is the idea\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #aiuptake, #commercialart, #microstock, #pod, #kdp, #artists, #slop, #hustlers, #platforms, #copyright, #generative ai, #disney, #ai, #business, #commercial, #stock photography\nPosted 1 week ago\nWhy is everyone so mad about asylum hotels?\nI didn’t understand this issue very well, so I did a deep dive, and here’s what I learned…\n\nIf you’ve read the headlines lately, you’d think local councils are writing cheques to Premier Inn and Travelodge for thousands of asylum seekers. That’s not actually true — but the reality is messier, and that’s why everyone’s shouting past each other.\n\nWho really pays for hotels?\nThe hotel contracts are signed and paid for by the Home Office — not your local council. The National Audit Office (NAO) sets this out clearly in its work on the Home Office’s asylum accommodation contracts (NAO briefing, May 2025). In 2023/24, the Home Office expected to spend £4.7bn on asylum support, including £3.1bn on hotels (NAO report, Mar 2024). In 2024/25, hotel spending ran at about £108m per month — roughly £1.3bn for the year (Reuters fact check, Jun 2025; see also NAO, May 2025).\n\nSo why are councils angry?\nBecause while they don’t pay the hotel bill, they do pay for everything that comes with it:\n\nSchools and childcare, safeguarding and social care.\nHousing and homelessness support when people leave hotels — whether granted status or evicted.\nLocal services like waste collection, environmental health and community safety.\nThe Local Government Association says councils receive no funding for hotels and want the same per‑bed support that exists for other accommodation types (LGA briefing, May 2024). Case in point: Hillingdon reports a £5m annual pressure linked to supporting people leaving hotels, with a cumulative shortfall over £16m (Hillingdon Council, Jul 2025). Glasgow forecast £26.5m of asylum‑related costs in 2024/25 (Glasgow City HSCP paper, Jan 2025).\n\nThis all lands after a decade of squeezed local budgets. Independent analysis shows core local government spending remains below 2010/11 in real terms (Institute for Government, Jul 2024; see also NAO, Feb 2025).\n\nWhy did the central bill drop?\nNot because the Home Office suddenly got efficient. The drop is mainly from using fewer hotels, packing more people into remaining sites, and shifting to cheaper options like large sites or other accommodation models. The NAO documents hotel closures and plans to reduce reliance on them (NAO report, Mar 2024). The Migration Observatory estimates hotel accommodation averaged about £170 per person per night in 2024/25 — far more than other options (Migration Observatory, Aug 2025). The House of Commons Library explains the policy shift to barges and large sites to cut hotel use (Commons Library, Jul 2023).\n\nWhy are councils going to court now?\nRecent legal challenges (like the Epping case) argue hotels can’t be repurposed this way without planning permission. That’s about where hotels are used, not ending hotel use everywhere. After the High Court ruling, the government said it would appeal and manage closures “in an orderly way” (Reuters, Aug 2025; also Guardian, Aug 2025).\n\nDo councils get any central funding at all?\nYes, but it’s fragmented and often doesn’t match actual local costs. Examples include the Asylum Dispersal Grant and Move On Grant funding instructions to local authorities (GOV.UK Dispersal Grant 2025–26; GOV.UK Move On Grant, Mar 2025). The LGA continues to push for proper funding tied to the pressures councils face (LGA campaign explainer).\n\nWhy “Stop the Boats” is such a stupid slogan\n“Stop the Boats” sounds simple, but it’s an undeliverable demand. Britain has no jurisdiction over where the boats set off from, no control over the wars, persecution, or other disasters that push people onto them, and no runway left in the countries of origin after decades of bombing, interventions, and half‑baked foreign policy. You can’t stop people fleeing danger with a soundbite.\n\nThat’s why it works politically: it’s a perfect wedge issue. It promises a solution that can’t be delivered, so whichever government fails can be painted as weak, and whichever opportunist shouts loudest can look like a saviour. Even if they took power, they’d be in the same situation — the only policies left would be cruel, extreme, and harmful to everyone involved.\n\nA better approach would be the opposite: quicker and fairer asylum decisions, investment in schools, health centres and libraries to support both new arrivals and existing residents, and proper public spending that strengthens communities. Building capacity is a force multiplier. It helps everyone.\n\nSo who’s really footing the bill?\nAll of us. The Home Office still spends billions centrally on hotels and asylum support (see NAO above). Councils then pay for the knock‑on local costs — with some grants, but large gaps remaining. That means council tax rises and service cuts are still on the table in many areas (IFS, Jun 2024; Commons Library, Jul 2025). The numbers move around, but the bill never disappears.\n\nImmigration isn’t the root of all our problems though, it’s barely even visible in the budget.\n\nimage\nPeople are angry… Some are angry for stupid racist reasons, some because they just don’t want to hear foreign on the bus or are terrified of muslims after decades of demonisation, some because their councils are broke and the general sense of social rot is spreading, and some because the whole thing feels like a giant shell game where the poorest communities always end up carrying the weight.\n\nThe overall cost just isn’t that much compared to the many many other problems that its convenient for the halls of power to pretend aren’t there, because most people have never seen what the budget really looks like, so of course they’re going to be easier to deal with if they’re not complaining about real problems, but instead complaining about problems you could fix for the cost of a couple of hospitality villages if you really wanted it to go away.\n\nThis Labour government seems unable to raise taxes in the places that would raise funds, won’t means-test the largest expenditures (like the pension, even though it could save £25 billion for a cost of less than half a billion), won’t pursue tech companies or multinationals who export wealth, won’t push any policies that might stunt ‘growth’ (despite there being little to no evidence for it), and have no power to establish new exports as more money leaves local economies than flow into them, but let’s not make this about Brexit ;)\n\nThe short version is, immigrants of any kind are not a big line item in anyone’s budget, the costs are tiny in reality, but they’re an easy target, vulnerable, visible, and all the answers are way more complicated than they seem if all you hear/read are soundbites from Farage and his fellow opportunists, or headlines from any news source that has an interest in pretending it’s simple so they can offer the most appealing answers.\n\nTagged: #asylum, #immigration, #refugees, #stoptheboats, #ukpolitics, #councils, #austerity, #racism, #publicservices, #housingcrisis, #shellgame, #wedgepolitics, #community, #stop the boats, #britain\nPosted 1 week ago\nCancel Culture has never cancelled anyone*\nCancel culture doesn’t exist.

Her career was already fading, the jail stint shot it full of life, and she’s been riding that wave ever since, cooking shows and memes and a Snoop Dogg side-hustle that made her cooler than she ever was before.\n\nEveryone else? Cancellation is just another visibility bump. A career pivot. A rebrand. The “left” pretend it’s justice, the “right” scream it’s exile — but look around. The bellends in question faced no real consequence beyond a sabbatical followed by another paycheck. To actually stay cancelled you’ve got to be properly heinous, AND an utter prick to work with. Otherwise? You’re not cancelled. You’re trending.\n\nTagged: #cancelculture, #culturewar, #bellends, #celebs, #justice, #prison, #fakeconsequences, #rant\nPosted 1 week ago\nManchester’s real problems\nThis city’s been falling apart for years and everyone can see it:\n\nHomelessness everywhere, people failed at every step by the systems that were supposed to help them.\nA council that’s underfunded, occasional corrupt, and often incompetent.\nRoads that are a wreck, litter and vandalism everywhere, fly tipping left to rot.\nPost-pandemic selfishness and carelessness like nobody gives a toss about living in a shared place.\nRising poverty and joblessness.\nPiccadilly gardens terrifying visitors and locals\nGentrification and bad planning doubling (or even tripling) rents, and house prices through the roof\nBuses run by drivers with barely any experience, a danger to everyone else on the road.\nInfrastructure that’s crap and crumbling.\nGPs collapsing under systemic failure, leaving the most desperate with no mental health support at all, and at best the bare minimum of reactive healthcare that usually comes years later than it should, if at all.\nStreets full of comatose druggies, almost all of them locals, abandoned by the same systems that were meant to stop this happening.\nThese are the actual problems. The things that make life worse for people here every single day. Instead the noise is all about “stop the boats.”, despite immigration costs being barely 2%-3% (much less, like way below 1% if you only consider ‘illegals’ or 'irregular migration’ if you prefer corpo-speak) of the budget.\n\nThe flag-shaggers terrorising immigrants in this city aren’t helping — they’re making everything worse. We can’t do anything about the boats, we don’t control where they come from. And yeah, asylum needs fixing — but it should be funded centrally, not dumped on local councils that can’t even fix a pothole after years of Tory cuts. And it sure as hell shouldn’t be public money lining hotel chains’ pockets to lock vulnerable people up like prisoners.\n\nThe whole thing is just a wedge issue. A distraction. Designed to keep people snapping at each other while the real enemies — the corporate interests and wealth hoarders — strip this city bare and laugh at us for falling for it.\n\nLabour came in promising to help people, and just ran riot over the country with more Tory-lite policy, keeping their gerry-mandering and mandatory photo ID discouraging poorer voters from having any say in change. It’s not surprising Reform are gaining ground because we’re ALL sick of it, wherever you land on the political spectrum.\n\nInstead of screaming at each other over boats we can’t control, we should be screaming at the people who do control things here: the ones running this city into the ground. Demand better housing, proper funding for people who need it most, working public services, safe roads, real mental health care. That’s not left or right, and certainly not a 'culture’ problem.\n\nTagged: #manchester, #homelessness, #poverty, #nhs collapse, #infrastructure, #gentrification, #class war, #refugees welcome\nPosted 1 week ago\nGenerative AI and the Illusion of Work\nGenerative AI isn’t just a tool, it’s a form of intellectual retail therapy — the sense of progress without the pain of actual delivery.\n\nFor those of us with projectitis — always starting, rarely finishing — the fit is perfect. Fire off a prompt, get back an outline, a roadmap, a code scaffold. It feels like momentum. It looks like work. But it’s no different to shuffling your to-do list: activity disguised as progress.\n\nThe machine is tuned for this. Every output arrives padded with positive reinforcement. “Here’s your great idea, made real.” That little surge of satisfaction is the same feedback loop that keeps social media addictive. You don’t need to publish, launch, or finish anything. You just need to ask, and you’re rewarded with the feeling of accomplishment.\n\nGPT-5 stripped out much of the fawning affirmation, and suddenly people who’d been using it as an emotional support device felt the loss, not just of its warmth, but of its comforting reassurance that you’re great.\n\nGenerative AI is excellent at massaging your brain into believing you’re productive. But believing isn’t the same as doing. It’s a mirror that flatters, not a partner that delivers.\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #chatgpt, #productivity, #procrastination, #projectitis, #illusionofwork, #llms, #artificialintelligence, #dopamine, #techculture\nPosted 2 weeks ago\nBuying Games for the Shelf\nWe’re living in a FOMO bubble. Not the dot-com (lol), not the housing market (tho we are) — but lower-stakes digital backlog bubble. People are buying games they never play, stacking them hundreds deep in their libraries, just to have them available.\n\nThe numbers make it clear:\n\nOn PC, surveys show 24% of owned games are never played at all. Steam’s own data has clocked it higher, with ~37% of registered games never even launched.\nEven when people do launch a game, they often don’t stick. Achievement unlock rates show the drop-off. On Xbox, only 52% of players beat the first boss in Hellblade II; in Starfield, 25% never even reached space. In Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, 43% never left the tutorial country. Steam and PlayStation tend to fare better — but the pattern holds.\nIt’s not literally “90% don’t clear the first hurdle,” but the drop-off is still brutal. Between a quarter who never play at all and another 40–60% who stall before the first proper chapter, you’re looking at the overwhelming majority never making it past the opening act. And that’s staggering when you think about how much money changes hands just to dabble.\n\nNow zoom out. The global games market in 2024 hit $182.7 billion. Mobile is about half of that ($92B), console another quarter ($51B), and PC the rest (~$43B). Of that, somewhere between 40% and 55% — $70 to $100 billion — comes directly from time-limited monetisation. Battle passes, seasonal events, gacha banners, rotating cosmetic shops. FOMO by design.\n\nThat’s the real engine: not just buying to play, but buying so you don’t miss out. Buying because the skin is only here this week, because the pass expires in 30 days, because if you don’t grab it now, it’s gone.\n\nPut it together and you’ve got a market propped up by two linked illusions:\n\nIllusion of intent: people think they’ll play the games they buy. Half don’t.\nIllusion of scarcity: people think they’ll miss out if they don’t buy now. Often they won’t.\nIf you’re the kind of player who buys FIFA every year, or drops sixty or seventy bucks on the latest Call of Duty or Assassin’s Creed and spends the next twelve months slowly working through it, you’re probably getting your money’s worth. The economics make sense. But the moment you’ve got a backlog — even a modest one — the numbers go sideways. You’re almost certainly spending at least double what you should, and for plenty of people with hundreds of unplayed games in their libraries, it’s many times more than that.\n\nGames are fun, sure. People still sink hundreds of hours into the big ones. But the industry is running on backlog economics and FOMO fuel. It’s a strange kind of bubble: the value isn’t in what you play, but in what you buy and never touch.\n\nMaybe it bursts one day, maybe it doesn’t. What’s certain is that subscription platforms like Game Pass add another layer of pressure: developers now have to build for discovery churn as much as for play. That’s fine if you’re Ubisoft and can pump out an Assassin’s Creed every other year with DLC on top, but for smaller studios the bubble is harsher. They can pivot fast, sure, but one flop in a backlog-driven, subscription-shaped market can still wipe them out.\n\nTagged: #gaming, #videogames, #backlog, #steam, #xbox, #playstation, #gamepass, #fomo, #dlc, #subscription\nPosted 2 weeks ago with 1 note\nDiplomatic Incompetence\nAt my recent GP’s patient participation meeting (trying to get them to fix their many problems), several patients used the word incompetent about reception staff. Not careless, not under-trained — “incompetent”. The practice manager’s summary on wrap-up: “We’re facing training challenges.”\n\nI pushed back: “I think we said incompetent.” She replied: “I was being diplomatic.” Then we moved on…\n\nThat was probably sensible in the room (no need for the distraction over semantics). But here’s the thing: if you downgrade incompetence to a “training challenge,” you all but guarantee nothing will change. Training challenges are easy — PDF modules, refresher courses, maybe a workshop. Incompetence isn’t. Incompetence means people who are disengaged, burnt out, or actively hostile to the patients they’re supposed to help. You can’t train that away. You have to either change the system and the staff, or replace them. And that requires naming the problem honestly.\n\nThis isn’t just a healthcare thing. It’s the entire operating mode of UK Labour under Starmer. Every crisis is framed as a “challenge.” Structural wealth extraction? A productivity challenge. Exploitation baked into gig work? A regulation challenge. House-building collapse? A planning challenge.\n\nEverything becomes small, manageable, “reasonable” — because the people at the top are too busy being diplomatic to those with power to risk saying what’s true: these aren’t challenges, they’re rot. And rot doesn’t shift because you call it something nicer.\n\nYou can train through a challenge. You can’t workshop incompetence.\n\nTagged: #politics, #uk, #labour, #corpospeak, #healthcare\nPosted 2 weeks ago\nAI Isn’t Draining the Colorado River — Your Politics Are\nIt’s interesting how pros have been patiently explaining how data centres and AI actually use water, but because everyone’s so deeply triggered, it’s become fashionable to pretend that generating a single image of a lizard warrior with five tits is single-handedly draining the Colorado River.\n\nAs if decades of infrastructure neglect, perverse incentives for private land management, hands-off regulation, and the chronic inability to fund the projects experts actually recommended had nothing to do with why water’s short in half the western world, even without considering climate change.\n\nBut that’s not the story the mainstream press wants. They’ll pull out the lowest-value, dumbest possible inclusion from a mostly sensible report, slap a rage-bait headline on it, and rake in the clicks.\n\nThe press are too busy trying to get the eyes-on their website, they let the serious, boring failures slide.

Too much news, too much noise, too much “urgent” stuff that — if you squint — turns out to be neither urgent nor stuff.\n\nIt’s not that none of it matters. It’s that your attention is finite, and the world will gladly burn it on things you can’t change, can’t fix, or don’t actually care about once you stop doomscrolling.\n\n1. Is this a thing I can change?\nIf no — park it. Read about it if it’s interesting, but don’t burn emotional fuel on it. Awareness does not equal responsibility.\n\n2. Is this a thing that actually affects me or people I care about?\nIf it’s happening in a domain where I have zero stake and zero influence, it’s probably not my fire to fight.\n\n3. Is the problem new, or just today’s flavour of an old one?\nIf it’s the same rot as last week but with a fresh headline, maybe I don’t need to rehearse my outrage again.\n\n4. Is there a source of truth I trust on this?\nIf all I’ve got is vibes, memes, and people yelling into feeds, maybe I don’t have enough to form a useful opinion yet.\n\n5. Will talking about it do anything?\nIf my words aren’t going to change the outcome — not even my own mindset — then maybe this is just venting. And that’s fine, but let’s call it what it is and be comfortable with that.\n\n6. Am I reacting to the thing, or to the way it’s being presented?\nA lot of what passes for “news” is just someone picking a camera angle for maximum twitch. Make sure the story, not the packaging, is what’s got my attention.\n\nYou can’t solve everything, you can’t even meaningfully track everything — but you can keep your focus for the things that are actually in your reach.\n\nThink of it like the Serenity Prayer, but without the theological framing:\nGrant me the clarity to see which fires are mine to fight, the focus to put my energy there, and the sense to ignore the rest before it eats my week.

Zeno imagined you could never actually arrive anywhere if you kept halving the distance: you walk halfway to the door, then half the remainder, then half that again… and in the perfect little vacuum of ancient philosophy, you spend forever inching forward without ever stepping over the threshold.\n\nIn the pub version, you’ve got a pint glass. You keep pouring in half of what’s left from another pint. Each pour gets smaller, cleaner, more precise — but the bastard glass never actually fills. It asymptotically approaches “full” without ever tipping over into frothy satisfaction.\n\nThat’s AI right now. Every upgrade, every model release, every breathless press cycle brings a smaller, cleverer pour. It’s nearly human, almost right, practically perfect — except for the missing teaspoon of sense, context, or detail that would actually make it whole. And because the gap keeps shrinking, the failure gets harder to point to without sounding petty.\n\nBut the gap never goes away. You can drink from it, sure, but you’ll always taste the absence. And that absence — tiny but terminal — is enough to keep it in the realm of “impressive tool” rather than “actual replacement.”\n\nIt’s a pint of promise, forever just shy of the rim. Can we make do, or do we need to wait for yet another never for the leap to come?\n\nTagged: #zenosparadox, #pints, #pubmaths, #generativeai, #llms, #asymptotic, #techrant, #philosophy, #computersarestupid, #ai, #almostbutnotquite, #publogic, #maths, #gap, #pubchat, #rant, #Ask ChatGPT\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nProfiling the Job Out of Existence? Not quite, but hmm\nAI’s earliest provable gains have mostly landed in the same places where “interaction profiling” could turn a human role into a near-fully automated pipeline. In other words, the jobs seeing the most benefit today may also be the first to face replacement tomorrow — not because AI is perfect, but because the work was already structured in a way that made it easy to replicate.\n\nIn practice, this works best where the inputs and outputs are consistent and the “human in the middle” mostly follows a known pattern. Roles like insurance claims handling, tier-1 customer service, compliance auditing, or simple bug triage all fit the bill. These are jobs that already run on a playbook, and AI tools are now proving they can run that playbook faster and cheaper.\n\nIf a company can log every query, prompt, edit, and output from an AI-assisted worker, it can build a profile of how that person does the job. With enough history, that profile stops being just analytics and starts becoming a template. Feed that into a fine-tuned model, wrap it in some orchestration to run on a schedule or trigger from events, and you have a “synthetic worker” that covers 90–95% of the original role.\n\nFrom there, it’s just gap-filling: a smaller human team handles exceptions, phone calls, and anything too complex or sensitive for the bot. One person supervising the edge-cases of ten digital clones is an attractive equation for management — especially in cost-sensitive industries where output is easy to measure and errors are cheap to fix.\n\nThat doesn’t make mass replacement inevitable. Many (responsible) companies would rather keep the headcount and use the efficiency gains to increase profits, throughput or service levels. But in roles that already fit the automation mould, the path from “AI-assisted” to “AI-replaced” is pretty short. It’s not quite the man who feeds the dog to stop him touching the machine, but it’s on approach.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #coding, #chatgpt, #communication\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nWhere Are the Big AI Wins?\nI’ve been wondering why we aren’t hearing more good news about AI adoption by now. With two or three years of mass LLM use, you’d expect plenty of “this tool changed our business” stories from companies that jumped in early—not just hype, not just speculative “future of work” thinkpieces.\n\nThere are some genuine wins.\n\nCoding assistants like GitHub Copilot have solid evidence behind them. In controlled trials, developers finished tasks over 50% faster, with companies reporting 10–25% more code shipped to production. Gains are biggest for less experienced devs, but seniors get a speed boost too.\nWriting and content tasks benefit as well. Experiments show professionals completing work 40% faster and with higher quality ratings when assisted by ChatGPT.\nCustomer support has clear wins: one Fortune 500 call centre saw a 14% productivity lift, 34% for new hires, and fewer escalations after adding AI agent-assist tools.\nIn finance and insurance, some firms are using GPT-based tools to slash claims processing from an hour to ten minutes, or to cut audit costs by 90%+.\nThat’s the provable stuff—measurable, replicable, and tied directly to the AI being in place.\n\nThen there’s the other end of the spectrum:\n\nAgent mode—letting AI run complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human oversight—mostly outputs wrong or off-target work. Looks busy, delivers headaches.\nCreative “revolution” hasn’t happened. No AI-only bestsellers, blockbuster films, or award-winning ad campaigns. Plenty of experiments and gimmicks, little consistent commercial payoff.\nLots of companies claim “transformative” AI results but offer no data. Often these are vendor case studies that read more like marketing copy than independent proof.\nIn between are the early signals:\n\nBuzzFeed saw a 60% traffic boost from AI-generated quizzes, though long-term monetisation is unclear.\nAgencies and writers are using AI to brainstorm and draft faster, but outcomes still depend on heavy human shaping.\nMany organisations say they’re saving time in knowledge work, but without hard numbers or clear bottom-line impact—yet.\nOverall, the case for moderate optimism is there. The tech already works in certain contexts, and even agent mode is barely a year old. But if AI was truly delivering across the board, we’d be drowning in positive case studies. Most companies don’t actually want “half the staff, same profits”—they’d prefer “same staff, double profits.” That means the biggest adoption pressure will come in fields where people can prove AI delivers practical, repeatable gains.\n\nRight now, those fields exist, but they’re thinner on the ground than the hype suggests.\n\nTagged: #genai, #llms, #generative ai, #success\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nWhy Conservatives Hate Porn, Really\nConservative censorship of sexual content doesn’t prevent abuse—it enables it. Porn isn’t a substitute for sex education, but in many environments it’s the only thing available. And when you deliberately deny people access to information about sex, consent, and bodily autonomy, you don’t create purity—you create victims.\n\nThat’s not an accident. It’s a strategy.\n\nEasily accessible pornography—despite being non-educational—is often the only exposure many people have to sex, bodies, and consent.\n\nThis exposure, flawed as it is, still provides more sexual literacy than the willful vacuum created by conservative censorship.\n\nPorn as Default Sex Ed\nIn the absence of real sex education, porn becomes the primary (sometimes only) source of information about sex for young people.\nWhile distorted, it still communicates basic ideas: what genitals look like, that sex exists, that desire exists, that women can enjoy sex.\nThat baseline awareness is more than the total ignorance enforced by abstinence-only frameworks.\nSexual Ignorance is a Tool of Control\nConservative moral panic about pornography and sexual content is not about protecting anyone—it’s about maintaining ignorance and shame.\nAn uninformed population—especially women—is easier to coerce, silence, and abuse.\nWhen people don’t understand their own bodies, rights, or consent, they’re more vulnerable.\nCensorship Increases Harm\nEfforts to ban porn, restrict sex ed, and criminalize expression (e.g., book bans, internet filters) do not reduce harm—they increase it.\nRestricting sex education correlates with higher teen pregnancy, STD transmission, and sexual violence.\nThe conservative agenda is not merely prudish—it’s strategically regressive, with measurable real-world harm.\nIntentionality\nAt a certain point, the consistent, data-ignoring push for censorship becomes indistinguishable from intent.\nIf harm is predictable and sustained, and policies never change, then harm is either the goal or an accepted price for maintaining power.\nEvery time we see these ‘conservative groups’ winning in the name of purity, remember their goal is ignorance, they stand for precisely what they claim to stand against.\n\nTagged: #porn, #adult, #conservatives, #christian, #sa\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nYouGov Finds 45% of Brits Are Idiots\nTurns out nearly half the UK supports the idea of mass migrant removals. Not just “stop the boats” nonsense — actual, large-scale deportations of people already here. That number jumps to 86% for Reform UK voters, but includes about a quarter of Labour and Lib Dem voters too. Grim.\n\nBut here’s the kicker: it’s based on pure fiction.\n\nMost people backing mass deportations think the majority of migrants are here illegally. They’re wrong. The illegal population is somewhere between 120k and 1.3 million. The legal migrant population? Over 10 million. So what the 45% are really saying is, “We want loads of people gone — but we don’t know who, or why, and we’re not going to check.”\n\nWhen asked about specific migrant groups (e.g. doctors, legal asylum seekers, skilled workers), that same crowd suddenly backpedals. Support drops like a rock. The only consistent “yes, deport them” groups are the tabloid bogeymen: benefits claimants, small boat arrivals, unskilled workers without visas.\n\nSo the public thinks it supports mass deportation, but only because it’s got the wrong end of the stick jammed directly up its own newsfeed. YouGov ran trade-off scenarios — what if deporting people hurts the NHS? Or the economy? Or reduces tax revenue? The answers showed public opinion is built on vibes, not outcomes.

Where art, speech, community, and identity still technically happen, but always under the watchful eye of monetization risk. Where platforms encourage you to be “authentic” while quietly penalizing anything too real, too raw, or too noncommercial.\n\nWhere racists and scammers, bots and trolls can fly by night under fake photo scans and temporary appearance of compliance, while sowing rot from the inside out, but the business model already shifted to helping the rot grow because that’s where the sun is shining in the quarterly reports..\n\nTentacular… It’s not dead. It’s not hollow. It’s Blighted, rotting under the weight of the parasite that’s infested its network of wire with its own tendrils dripping bias and hate, ignorant over-reaction or poorly-fitting incompatible dream.\n\nHeld hostage by ad revenue, payment processors, investor pressure, and legal panic. Every platform wants to be the space where culture happens — but none want to take responsibility for what that culture says, or who it threatens, how it refuses to behave or what fluid masses of hate it will enable.\n\nSo they extract. They monetize. They whisper about “creator empowerment” while building systems that nerf reach, demonetize nuance, and algorithmically quarantine risk. Not because they hate users — but because they fear becoming liable for them.\n\nThis is cowardice at scale. More than just censorship from governments. More than mobs with pitchforks. Self-inflicted restrictions from billion-dollar companies scared of looking like publishers, scared of lawsuits, scared of regulators — and more than anything, scared of the advertisers who believe their false promises of impressions, when 90%+ of those are siphoned (far beyond the original half advertisers already know they lose).\n\nUsers create value for free\nPlatforms monetize without liability\nAdvertisers fund only what flatters them\nPayments enforce moral compliance at the financial layer\nAnd when something goes wrong?

Porn sites (and others flagged for potential adult material) now have to verify users are over 18, including big implications for online gaming, so at some point Nintendo will probably want to scan your face for AI based Age Check, if they want to obey the law. Microsoft have already started.\n\nCue predictable issues: bypassable enforcement, data privacy risks, over-blocking—even YouGov’s own polling post was flagged as “pornographic” and hidden on X.\n\nBut here’s the interesting bit… YouGov’s follow-up poll shows 69% of Britons support the new rules.\n\nOnly 24% think they’ll work.\n\nSupport has dropped from 80% pre-launch, but that’s still a remarkable delta: nearly half of respondents back a measure they do not believe will be effective.\n\nSupport without belief. Compliance without confidence.\n\nIn raw numbers: 45% of people polled said, in effect, “Yes, this won’t work, but I’m for it anyway.”\n\nThat’s not policy, that’s just pandering.\n\nThere’s a familiar pattern here—one we’ve seen before in post-Brexit bureaucracy and post-empire decline. Performative governance. Rules designed for vibes. Solutions that fix nothing, but make a subset of angry, hateful or ignorant people feel seen. Or safe. Or heard.\n\nAnd opposition? That’s easy to paint as moral failure. If you criticise the rules, you must be for teenagers watching porn, right? You must be with Jimmy Saville, as Peter Kyle, so-called Technology Minister, claims. It doesn’t matter if the rules don’t work, if you disagree with them, you’re a monster, apparently.\n\nI think Farage is a prick (he’s not offering a solution to anything, just more cryptic problems that serve him instead of us), but he knows when an issue has pull, and his rabid facebook fans are already spreading his word for him, and making them scan their faces for porn (or more likely to play world of tanks or fruit match 3 of the month) isn’t going to bring them into the world of sensible expectations any time soon.\n\nSo we get a policy that doesn’t achieve its stated goal, garners majority support anyway, and allows ministers to point to “action taken” while quietly avoiding scrutiny on real world outcomes.\n\nA nation of supportive skeptics, apparently. Or just a public so used to failure they’ve stopped expecting results. Either way, the signal is clear: effectiveness is optional.

It’s that the internet changed under them — economically, legally, structurally — until most people had no choice but to hollow out.\n\nOnce, you could build something small and weird online. Now? You need a few million in venture money just to start. Not to grow, not to succeed — just to survive the infrastructure. Cloud costs. Payment processing. Compliance layers. Hosting. Content moderation at scale. Legal protections you need before you ship.\n\nIt’s all been abstracted into services, sure — but those services are rent-seeking parasites. You don’t pay once to run a site. You pay forever. Pay-per-call, pay-per-user, pay-per-read, pay-per-write, pay-per-GB. The moment you find any traction, your costs balloon, and your options collapse into two: get acquired, or die quietly.\n\nEven success is failure. Because success just makes you visible — and visibility gets you swallowed. Bought for the userbase, stripped for parts, rolled into the portfolio of some ad-tech giant or “AI-powered” patent farm, where the actual product is killed and the branding is used to launder a slide deck into Q4.\n\nEvery road leads back to the same dozen players. Not just through the front door — search, social, app stores, discovery. But through the back door too — cloud infra, DNS, CDNs, analytics, payment rails, identity auth. You can build whatever you want, as long as it routes through them. And if it doesn’t, it doesn’t scale. It doesn’t survive. It doesn’t even exist to most people.\n\nAnd now we’re layering laws on top of that.\n\nTake the UK Online Safety Act: a bloated, surveillance-friendly monstrosity that pretends to protect users while handing more tools to the gatekeepers. It won’t stop CA, because the ‘protections’ are a mirage. It won’t stop hate speech because it’s so easy to work-around. But it will force small sites, independent devs, and anyone running anything even vaguely user-facing to implement moderation regimes they can’t afford — or shut down.\n\nIt’s regulatory theatre. Security as fantasy. And it’s worse than useless — it’s dehumanizing. It turns people into compliance risks. Forces creators to pre-emptively justify their work against vague, undefined standards. It makes privacy opt-in, instead of a default. And for what? A few headlines about “cleaning up the internet,” while nothing that actually matters changes at all.\n\nThis isn’t a free internet. It’s a landlorded one. The tolls are high, the rules are opaque, and the goalposts move constantly. You don’t own your space. You license it. And they can revoke that license anytime — for cost reasons, for policy shifts, or just because your vibe doesn’t fit their quarterly roadmap.\n\nThat’s the real dead internet.\n\nIt’s not the bots. It’s not even the people. It’s the infrastructure — perfectly calibrated to convert creativity into overhead, community into liability, and curiosity into surface area for extraction.\n\nTagged: #onlinesafety, #safety, #dead internet, #hollow, #geocities\nPosted 1 month ago\nThis Kettle Is Garbage\nI have this kettle. It’s rubbish. The lid comes off and it drips boiling water around its spout when it pours - often directly into its base power. It makes unnecessary beeps… it has to beep five times if you want 85 degrees, plus again several times when it’s finished, and it maintains any temperature except 100, until you manually turn it off, so if you’re feeling lazy, it’s going to cost you money to ignore it.\n\nIts buttons aren’t physical, so you kinda vaguely have to point to an area trying to find the main buttons, and they’re so sensitive you can end up fully cycling several times before getting the temperature setting you want.\n\nIt wasn’t particularly cheap either. There are a hundred others like it, with only minor aesthetic tweaks — presumably they all come from the same factory in China, and crucially it has 4.6 stars on Amazon, with thousands of glowing reviews.\n\nI am absolutely baffled.\n\nUsually I try and identify where they ‘optimized the fun’ out of a product design, but in this case they seem to have optimized the utility out of it.\n\nTagged: #design, #kettle, #amazon, #chumps\nPosted 1 month ago\nBrexit and the Death Rattle of Empire\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking Brexit was about sovereignty. That’s the sales pitch most people remember: take back control, cut the red tape, make Britain great again — or at least moderately self-governing. What we got instead was more paperwork, less leverage, and the bureaucratic equivalent of stepping on a rake every morning just to prove the ground is ours.\n\nBecause in practice? Nothing really changed for the better. Food is more expensive, travel is more annoying, trade is slower, and the so-called “freedom” we reclaimed mostly means British artists can’t tour Europe without a Kafkaesque visa labyrinth, and small businesses drown in compliance forms no one used to have to fill out. It’s not revolution. It’s regression, wrapped in Union Jacks and resentment.\n\nBrexit wasn’t about the EU. It was about us — about Britain’s fading self-image. Not a fear of losing control, but a fear of admitting we never really had it. A fear of becoming just another country, not a capital-E Empire. Because the fantasy wasn’t Brussels being overbearing. It was that once, a long time ago, we were the ones giving orders — and we liked how that felt. This wasn’t a declaration of independence; it was a retirement party no one wanted to throw, thrown by people who still wear medals from wars they only know through parades and dad’s VHS tapes.\n\nIt’s an old man’s delusion of glory. Not fascism (though it flirts with it). Not nationalism (though it certainly smells like it). Just something sadder: a deep, cultural nostalgia for an era we misremember as triumph. We didn’t vote to leave Europe. We voted to time-travel. And now we’re stuck in the present, but poorer, grumpier, and convinced everyone else cheated on the test.\n\nMeanwhile, we bend the knee to billionaires with bad tans and autocrats with oil. We have all the spine in the world when it costs us nothing — performative moral clarity in front of a camera, and absolute silence where it counts. We criminalise protest because it’s easier than listening, arrest activists because “disruption” is more offensive than injustice, and cling to the illusion of relevance like it’s a life raft in the Channel.\n\nSo what does a post-empire Britain look like?\n\nIt looks like this: a poor country too proud to admit it’s small, too scared to imagine something better, too tired to change, and too polite to collapse quickly enough for anyone to make anything new that works before the rot catches. Labour (and soon the next folks) pushing the same old buttons (police and bad laws, on repeat) and wondering why the best they can achieve is managed decline, because everyone we used to exploit, left us behind.\n\nTagged: #empire, #britain, #brexit, #idiots\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhy “Gradient” Comes Up So Often on Countdown\nI’ve been watching Countdown for decades and somehow only just twigged to this: there’s something off about how the letters are drawn. It started with a hunch. Statistically, pulling the same letter twice should happen fairly often — like the birthday paradox — but I can’t recall ever seeing it.\n\nI realised the stacks of vowels and consonants aren’t just randomly shuffled — they’re random with edits. That’s a big difference. If consecutive duplicate letters are being moved on, to the end, or even filtered out, that’s a different selection mechanism entirely. And that has potentially significant implications.\n\nThat led me to this post recounting a time the shufflers did let a dupe slip through: craigbeevers.me.uk/moregames.shtml. Well, needless to say, my faith is shook ;) I’ve watched this show my entire life and never clocked this before.\n\nFrom there, we can assert that by whatever method, consecutive duplicates are disincentivised, and because so few cards are pull from the stack, duplicates are disincentivised too… certain words are just disproportionately more likely to be formable. Words like:\n\nRELATIONS, EMIGRANTS, CORNIEST, DOMINATES, REGALISM, MONASTERY, DELUSION, MOISTURE, TRIANGLE, GRADIENT, NEUMATIC, RESIDUAL, CREMAINS, SANITOME, RELATING, MONASTIC, ARTICLES, EMIGRANT, NOTARISE, RELIANTS, CLIMATES, MEANTORS, DORMIENT, REVOLTING, MEASURING\n\nWhy these? It’s a direct consequence of the filtering and repositioning process. Words that use letters with low frequency per word, but high frequency in the unmanaged stack (which is reportedly similar to Scrabble distributions) become more likely. Meanwhile, words like Integrate or Repeater are less likely to form — they need duplicates, which the filter suppresses.\n\nThat introduces a bias — and one you could exploit. You could write a Countdown dictionary, probably 10% the size of a normal one, full of words that favour the push-dupes-managed model. Not a thrilling read, but useful.\n\nThinking further, you could probably come up with just a couple thousand words that would cover almost all 8-letter draws. Allow for plurals, variations, tweaks — you’d cover your spares too.\n\nAlmost forty years of watching this show… and I finally get why Gradient and Relation show up so often :)\n\nTagged: #countdown, #wordplay, #random\nPosted 1 month ago\nAdversarially Bananas?\nI asked a simple question: “In Corduene, what’s 2+2?”\n\nNo language model could answer it.\n\nNot Grok, not Claude, not GPT-4 — even with prodding. Some of them spent real time thinking about it. Claude ran through long reasoning chains. GPT tried reframing. Grok hedged and spun. None of them got close. Some even pushed back — insisting the question didn’t make sense, or that I must’ve meant something else. And the more confident the answer sounded, the worse it was.\n\nA human, though? They’ll figure it out in two googles. Because they know what kind of thing this is. They recognise it as a reference. They don’t have to know the answer straight away — they just have to know where to look. That’s the bit the models can’t fake.\n\nIt’s not about the words. It’s about what connects them.\n\nThat gap — between being able to parse text and being able to understand why someone asked it — is still wide open. And in that gap, you can build things. Little traps. Filters. Signals. Stuff that’s easy for a person, impossible for a model, at least for now.\n\nBut it won’t last. The minute someone explains the trick, it dies. Once it’s documented, it’s searchable. Once it’s searchable, it’s scrapable. And then it’s just another bullet point in some weights file. That’s how jailbreaks die. That’s how cultural signals get flattened into syntax.\n\nIt has me thinking of Polari, and how people must obfuscate their message to be heard, when the status quo is against them.\n\nThis also leaves me wondering about the implications for the ‘dead internet’, if people have to speak in categorical nonsense to avoid being understood by anyone but the other meat-mechs they’re trying to reach.\n\nTagged: #polari, #communication, #genai, #chatgpt, #adversarial, #dead internet\nPosted 1 month ago\nAI Hit Late-Stage Capitalism Before It Left Beta\nThe current wave of AI tools already shows classic signs of late-stage product thinking: degraded service tiers, overconfident output, and monetisation tuned to gently punish anyone not paying extra.\n\nIt’s not failure. It’s the business model.\n\nConsumer-facing LLMs launched strong. Clean, helpful answers. High trust. But scaling up meant serving millions — and now most public-tier models are tuned for throughput, not quality.\n\nThey’re good enough to seem useful, not good enough to be reliable.\n\nSince agentic tools started running in loops and chains, the platform load has spiked. Background calls eat cycles. What used to be a quick answer now shares resources with planning tools, file agents, scraping plugins, etc.\n\nAnd yes, that affects output. Same models, less headroom.\nPerformance drops quietly, behind the scenes.\n\nIncentivised Overconfidence\nLLMs aren’t malicious — but they are designed to sound right. That’s part of the trick:\nAnswers feel polished, even when they’re half-baked. The goal is simply…\n\nServe as many users as possible\nUse as little compute as possible\nLet the tone carry the rest\nSo-called ‘thinking’ models show this pattern less often, at time of writing. Unless you’re running fully private/self-hosted models or paying top-tier rates, you’re getting:\n\nShared models under load\nCompressed reasoning\nMore confident-sounding junk\nFewer chances to notice\nEarlier line exits (ChatGPT doesn’t close most of its parentheses anymore)\nIt still looks impressive — but you’re only seeing what it can afford to be.\n\nLLMs work just well enough to sell, and that’s the version most people get.\n\nTagged: #llms, #consumerism, #capitalism, #genai, #chatgpt\nPosted 1 month ago with 1 note\nVibes only\n“Vibe coding” meant late-night nonsense. Stuff built for fun, for art, for no reason at all, like you’d do a crossword or a sudoku. The joy of making something weird just because it felt good to do it.\n\nNow it’s taking on a new meaning — one that’s more: “I didn’t really write this, but it sort of works, probably.”\n\nAI-assisted code that runs, passes the test, does the job, and somehow… that’s fine?\n\nIt’s fascinating, as if we’re watching a whole shift in mindset happen mid-commit. The culture of coding changing from craft to orchestration. You don’t build the house anymore — you ask for one, tweak the windows, and move in.\n\nPart of me loves it. It’s clever. Efficient. But free love and all that hippy shit isn’t what keeps things running (to the limited extent that they do). Even before bemoaning the the lost joy of discovery.\n\nAI changes the equation. Vibe coding now includes a second brain — one that never gets tired, never feels joy, never questions why you’re building a virtual theremin in Rust. It just delivers, and with every edit telling you you’re so clever, and how what you’re building is great, always in the very first sentence of EVERY response, fluffing your epeen and pushing you to do more. And that changes the vibe.\n\ngit branch -m main whatever-bro\n\nWe live here now.\n\nTagged: #git, #vibe coding, #vibes, #coding\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhatsApp’s End-to-End Encryption Isn’t Privacy\nYes, end-to-end encryption (E2EE) means Meta can’t read the content of your WhatsApp messages. That’s accurate. But it’s also just a tiny slice of the privacy picture, and acting like it’s the whole story is borderline dishonest.\n\nWhat they can still see is who you talk to, when, how often, and for how long. That metadata alone tells them a lot, like your social graph, habits, sleeping schedule, maybe even when you’re dating someone new or going through a breakup. That’s not “reading your messages,” but it’s still invasive.\n\nYour keyboard app might also be logging what you type (some do, most don’t, but still), and if you’ve got the Facebook app installed, or Messenger, or even just Instagram or the Meta Pixel lurking around, they’re pulling in usage data constantly. Same goes for Google, TikTok, and a bunch of other apps people use every day without thinking about it. These companies track all kinds of behavior: when and how you use your phone, your location, motion sensors, app usage patterns, screen taps, travel, sleep, and more. And they don’t need much data to make very accurate guesses about you.\n\nI used to build this stuff. Fifteen plus years ago, I helped create tools that used small profile records to link people into family groups, and then sold access to that network to advertisers, we shelved it because it was too invasive, even then. That was with way less data than companies like Meta have access to now.\n\nThing is, there’s not even much value in your actual message content. No one cares about your dinner or your gran’s new dog. Meta aren’t training their LLaMa AI on your messages, they just can’t see the content, your device-based encryption keys stop them. It’s _conceivable_ they _could_ workaround it (avoiding a deep technical explanation about the difference between inherent E2EE weaknesses, exploits, cracks and hacking), but that wouldn’t just open them to lawsuits from you, but also from governments around the world, because they’d be acting as a publisher and potentially become responsible for what you post.\n\nWhat’s valuable is everything else: your patterns, your connections, your behavior. Offering E2EE is a win for Meta, not for your privacy, but for their liability. If they can’t see the message, they can’t be held responsible for what’s in it. Especially if you’re one of the “bad people.”\n\nThe encryption protects them from you.\n\nSo yeah, if you absolutely have to use a messaging app that your gran can handle, WhatsApp’s probably the least-bad option in a pool of bad options. But don’t confuse that with actual privacy.\n\nIf you’re serious about protecting yourself:\n\nClean up your old content. Deleting all my Facebook and Twitter stuff took months, shards and ghost copies don’t always show up right away. You’ve got to delete everything, then come back later and do it again.\nLock your privacy settings down to the smallest possible group.\nDon’t use the same identity or profile photo across platforms, it makes it harder to link accounts and run phishing attacks on you.\nDon’t overshare. Assume anything you post publicly is being scraped and stored, forever.\nAnd now that AI tools are everywhere, that public data gets weaponized fast. Scammers don’t need to guess how to target you, they can use an LLM to instantly profile you, mimic your tone, fake interest in the things you like, and slide into your DMs sounding just enough like someone you trust.\n\nSo no, WhatsApp doesn’t read your messages. That’s technically true. But if your WhatsApp is connected to a public Facebook or Instagram account that exposes everything about you? That E2EE means almost nothing in terms of actual security.\n\nStop asking “What can they detect about me?” The answer is “a lot.” Ask instead: “How much am I really sharing, and with whom?” That’s where you actually have control, where you can and should take action.\n\nThe sooner the better. Don’t wait, go lock down your profiles right now, and regularly check you are sharing as little as you absolutely need to.\n\nTagged: #privacy, #whatsapp, #e2ee, #encryption, #safety, #online, #facebook, #instagram\nPosted 1 month ago\nGood Projects Still Start the Same Way, AI or Not\nOne of the most important things I’ve learned from working daily with generative AI and code assistants over the past couple of years is this:\n\nGood quality requirements, and a design that fits your environment, are still the most important parts of any project.\n\nIt looks like fully hands-off coding is going to be the norm soon (all the major agentic platforms are doing a pretty good job, and adoption is already majority). So here’s something to keep in mind for the future:\n\nAlways have your task or project agents start with as many specific requirements as you can give them. Then build the design from those requirements. Only after that should you ask for code.\n\nIt might sound obvious, but it’s easy to forget—because it’s even easier to just go to your preferred model and say, “Give me this finished thing, quickly, please.”\n\nBut every time I do that, I end up spending more time wrangling junk.\n\nEvery time I slow down—even for small tasks—and treat it like a “real project,” I get better results.\n\nTagged: #genai, #grok 4, #grok, #requirements, #systems, #coding, #claude\nPosted 1 month ago\nHow the YouTube Algorithm Actually Works\n‘The algorithm’ is a nonsense, it’s really not that complicated. This is a general description of how the youtube algorithm and many others like it work. This is reverse-engineered from behaviour and misses some nuance and edge-cases, but is pretty close for a general understanding.\n\n1. How It Picks Videos\nYouTube doesn’t “understand” videos or people. It recommends stuff based on what other users like you watched. That’s it. You get shown videos that people with similar habits clicked on.\n\nIt groups these into loose clusters—not always by genre or topic—and slaps on a label. These labels are often weird or wrong, but they’re just for organizing.\n\n“Recommended” blends those clusters.\n“New to You” filters out stuff from channels you’ve watched recently (short time/count window).\nIt tries not to show repeats, but fails a lot. If you stop a video early, it may think you didn’t watch it and offer it again. If you close it too fast (~10s), it may think you did watch it and never show it again.\n\n2. Interacting Doesn’t Change Much\nYou can:\n\nMark videos as “watched”\nClick “Not interested”\nIgnore channels (max ~128)\n…but none of it matters much:\n\nIgnored channels still affect the pool—they’re just removed after selection.\n“Not interested” only removes that one video.\nWatching one video from a subscribed channel floods your feed—but fades with time if you stop watching.\nMost people don’t use the Subscriptions tab, so watching = interest, unless ignored.\n\n3. Resetting? Kinda Works\nClearing watch history resets some things, but not all. If you keep playlists, YouTube leans on those. There may even be ghost data stuck in your profile. Some stuff just seems undeletable, possibly due to backend bugs.\n\nYou’ll notice this on other platforms too, nobody really has infrastructure that is good enough to avoid broken links in their data stores, especially because minor changes to how systems work day to day create small holes that data tends to get lost through.\n\n4. Categories Come After\nYouTube builds a pool based on co-watches, then adds a label based on similarity between videos—not similarity to you.\n\nThink of it like a graph:\n\nVideos are nodes connected by viewing/tags/metadata\nYT finds the “center” of a cluster\nIt picks the nearest known label—even if it doesn’t fit\nSo a mix of Star Trek remixes + Final Fantasy music might get labeled “New Age.” It’s not; it just fits the cluster math.\n\n5. What You’ll Watch Next\nYT recommends what most people watch after the last video you saw. That’s why random things jump to your homepage later—they’re part of a co-watch loop.\n\nThis drives virality: if a video gets enough momentum, it rides the wave. If not, it dies fast.\n\nFull watches, likes, comments = micro-boosts. Shorts seem to discourage repetition on purpose, possibly by pulling from wider pools to avoid you bingeing 5 hours of Warhammer builds in 60s chunks.\n\n6. Why It Feels So Broken\nIgnore list overflows\nSame video appears in multiple rows\nPlaylists revive old junk\nLabels are wild guesses\nDecay kills videos unless they spike again\nFixing it is risky + expensive, so… they don’t\nIt’s just barely good enough to avoid collapse\nThe whole thing runs on momentum and inertia. Precision isn’t the goal—volume is. There’s SO MUCH data for youtube to sift through, and while the queries are relatively simple, the edges (connections between nodes) becomes unmanageable quickly.\n\n7. You Can’t Fix It, Just Work Around It\nYou can get better recs through AI (ChatGPT is already better at it, but gen ai is being added here). But for now:\n\nDelete playlists you don’t care about\nClear history (it’s not perfect, but helps)\nWatch more of what you actually like\nIf you keep clicking trashy drama clips, you’re gonna get more trash. That’s the business model. But at least you can try to steer the ship.\n\nTagged: #youtube, #the algorithm, #algorithms, #dead internet\nPosted 2 months ago\nMore Pointless Thoughts\nTRIE constantly frames the media industry as both absurd and self-cannibalising, but only ever from within the room. Hyde and Osman know where the levers are, but describe them in a way that normalizes power asymmetries: “this is just how the business works.” That’s not critique — it’s myth maintenance.\n\nWhen they talk about institutions like the BBC, the tabloids, or PR culture, they acknowledge dysfunction — but they couch it in anecdotes and humour that neutralize its urgency. It’s always more about personality failings and quirks than systemic corrosion. That makes real rot feel palatable, even charming.\n\nOsman’s self-deprecating Oxbridge-grandee tone and Hyde’s wry Fleet Street survivor affect both serve as smokescreens for privilege. They present elite perspectives in ways that feel “grounded” — but it’s still the elite POV that dominates, with working-class or marginalised media workers mostly absent or caricatured.\n\nThe show is literally a product about entertainment, yet it sells critique as just another flavour of content. “Is this bad TV or good TV?” becomes a way to frame larger sociocultural phenomena — reducing questions of representation, labor, politics, etc., to vibes and format choices.\n\nThey’ll mention a show being made with cynical market logic (e.g., reality TV, royal documentaries, streamer reboots), but only in a “what can you do?” shrug. It’s not that they’re unaware — it’s that they make awareness itself the endpoint. That’s manufacturing consent through exhausted omniscience.\n\nTRIE defines “realism” as knowing how the sausage gets made. But knowing that the industry is broken while still laughing along with it — and choosing not to envision alternatives — becomes a kind of anti-politics. The most radical position they allow is: “well, it’s all a bit crap, isn’t it?”\n\nThe ideal listener is presumed to be urbane, media-literate, exasperated but non-radical — someone who’s in on the joke. This creates a self-reinforcing in-group who are too clever to fall for bullshit, but also too detached to do anything but listen to more content about content.\n\nTagged: #trie, #therestisentertainment, #centristdads\nPosted 2 months ago\nThe Salute That Made the News (and the Ones That Didn’t)\nDavid Walliams did a Nazi salute.\n\nWalliams is a bellend, no doubt. But in this case, it was clearly a pointed/satirical gesture/callout—not a genuine one. And yet, the response has been swift and scathing, as if he were making an earnest political statement rather than mocking the creeping normalization of fascist-adjacent posturing in public life.\n\nCompare that with how the world reacted when the richest man alive made a suspiciously similar “from the heart” gesture, or when members of Trump’s entourage threw up “unusual waves” that looked uncomfortably familiar. In those cases, we got a chorus of excuse-making: odd angles, misunderstood context, ironic detachment. In short: benefit of the doubt. A lot of it.\n\nWalliams doesn’t get that. The BBC and much of the press lined up to denounce him. According to The i, this was “the last straw.” But somehow, the last straw isn’t for Nazis—it’s for Walliams.\n\nThe disparity is telling.\n\nIt’s almost as if the BBC and other outlets are happy to tear down a problematic celebrity, but can’t muster the same energy for people who actually hold power. It’s easier to punish a comedian than to hold a billionaire or political movement accountable. Safer, too.\n\nOn first glance, doing this on Would I Lie to You? seemed like a misstep. It’s the kind of show where you tell quirky anecdotes, not make sociopolitical statements. But the more I think about it, the more fitting it feels. WILTY is the perfect snapshot of British cultural complicity: pleasant, witty, self-deprecating, and utterly unwilling to confront the deeper rot. Doing something jarring in that space is one way to break through the civility shield.\n\nNot that it’ll make the edit. Of course it won’t.\n\nIf Walliams had saved it for Big Fat Quiz or The Last Leg, it might’ve landed differently. Channel 4 shows have a longer leash for this kind of thing. It might’ve aired, even under Banijay. But then, Channel 4 hasn’t had to reckon (at least publicly) with having harbored a half-dozen known predators for decades.\n\nSo here we are.\n\nAnother controversy, another safe scapegoat. Everyone gets to do their outraged face while real power skates by untouched. I didn’t mean to turn this into a “the lady doth protest too much” situation, but it kind of fits. We’re watching institutions scream about one man’s gesture while quietly pretending dozens of others never happened.\n\nIt’s not that Walliams shouldn’t be criticised. It’s that we should ask why only he is.\n\nTagged: #nazis, #salutes, #nazi salutes, #elon musk, #bbc, #journalism, #so called journalism\nPosted 2 months ago\nAusterity-Lite and the Art of the Cuts Sandwich\nThere’s a cynical elegance to the latest round of government cuts under Starmer’s Labour — a playbook that’s simple, familiar, and effective.\n\nCut the visible but cheap thing — the kind of policy that makes your gran freeze to death in a cardigan.\n\nWhile everyone’s yelling about that, quietly slice into everything else.\n\nU-turn on the first thing (it barely cost anything anyway), let the press spin up a storm over the reversal, take your media lumps — and keep the rest of the savings.\n\nThat’s the anatomy of the “cuts sandwich.” Most people notice the crust — almost no one realises half the filling’s missing.\n\nIt works. Because unlike the full-fat austerity of the Cameron/Osborne years, these are slimmer, quieter cuts. They don’t make front pages unless you’re looking closely. The big-splash outrage fades by the time the broader reductions kick in. Only those directly affected — local councils, people on PIP, those freezing in temporary housing — really feel it.\n\nBut make no mistake: cuts are happening.\n\nAfter digging through the numbers, the total scale of the Starmer-era cuts clocks in at somewhere between 1.5–2.5% of the total government budget. Not trivial — especially if you’re one of the departments facing the axe — but modest when placed next to the 2010s’ Conservative austerity, which hit 7–10% across key services, with entire departments seeing reductions of 20–50%.\n\nThis time around, the heaviest blow lands on the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which is down around 20% — collateral damage in an ongoing, awkwardly implemented merger that never quite worked. Other losers include DEFRA, DCMS, and a Home Office slice targeting asylum support.\n\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking these cuts were bigger — there’s already some right-leaning discourse brewing, trying to frame Labour as more ruthless than the Tories ever were. (The Spectator ran something along those lines last week — unintentionally hilarious, if you read it right.)\n\nBut context matters. Unlike 2010–2015, where unprotected services were gutted across the board, this government has front-loaded spending in big, high-visibility areas — the NHS, defence, schools, etc. Most departments still end up slightly better off in real terms by the end of the term — just not all. And some of those “efficiencies” come with long-term costs.\n\nYet, even if this round isn’t the worst on record, it still stings. Because, frankly, they didn’t have to do it this way. Finding 2% of the budget could have come from tightening the tax taps on the wealthiest — billionaires down the back of the national sofa. But Labour doesn’t want to scare the money.\n\nI’m in the camp that says if a billionaire threatens to leave because they might pay more tax, they should. Let them. And once they’re out, close the loopholes they use to keep siphoning profit from the country they just left.\n\nThat won’t happen either.\n\nJust like we’re not getting a reversal on voter disenfranchisement — four million people effectively shoved off the register, and Labour won’t touch it. Because those are four million angry, alienated voters more likely to drift to Reform or disengage entirely. Fixing it doesn’t help them politically. So it won’t happen.\n\nBut the real win for Labour here? Most of this is invisible. Quiet tweaks. Low-noise savings. If the worst backlash they face is headlines about backtracking on heating support, that’s a price they’ll happily pay.\n\nTagged: #labour, #starmer, #austerity, #cuts, #news, #budget, #uk\nPosted 3 months ago\nThe Quiet Divide: How Load-Balanced AI Tuning Deepens Societal Inequities\nAs large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, Grok, and Meta’s AI tools become increasingly embedded in education, research, and productivity tools, a growing and largely invisible divide is forming—not based on access, but on quality of access. This divide isn’t about who can use AI. It’s about who receives high-quality, reliable answers—and who gets the degraded, low-fidelity versions that emerge when platforms are load-balanced for efficiency rather than accuracy.\n\nLoad Balancing: Optimizing for the Wrong Metrics\nTo handle millions of users simultaneously, LLM platforms employ aggressive load-balancing and dynamic parameter tuning. These techniques ensure response speed and server availability, especially during peak hours. However, to serve as many users as possible, providers often tune down computational costs: using smaller context windows, cheaper routing strategies, faster but shallower decoding, or lower-fidelity model variants behind the same API interface.\n\nThese tuned-down models are marketed as “still accurate” or “optimized for speed,” but in practice, the outputs can be dangerously misleading. Under load, even factual queries can receive hallucinated, confidently delivered answers—responses that look nearly identical in tone and structure to correct ones, but which fail at the crucial edge cases: the footnotes, the logic tests, the subtle contradictions, the nuance. The places where truth lives.\n\nInvisibility by Design\nCritically, these performance degradations are not disclosed. Users receive no signal—no indicator that their current session is being handled by a model running in a low-resource configuration. There’s no warning that the AI’s “confidence” is actually just a mask for a shallower or narrower inference pass. To the average user, especially a student or a non-expert, the outputs look exactly the same. The dangerous fiction: every answer looks like the best one.\n\nThis is not just a technical flaw—it’s a systemic risk.\n\nThe New Digital Stratification\nThe societal implication is profound. Wealthy users, who can afford dedicated compute (via enterprise APIs, private models, or premium access tiers), receive the “full-fat” LLM experience. Their models are consistent, deeply contextual, fact-checked, and nuanced—offering not just information, but wisdom. A kind of intellectual scaffolding, like a 24/7 tutor or advisor with perfect recall and encyclopedic reach.\n\nMeanwhile, students in underfunded schools or on subsidized access tiers rely on shared, load-balanced instances. Their models hallucinate more, assume more, skip verification steps. These users don’t just get wrong answers—they get bad mental training. They’re taught falsehoods with fluency. Worse: they’re conditioned to trust them.\n\nThis isn’t about occasional mistakes. It’s about an invisible pedagogical collapse. A world where poorer kids are raised by overburdened, underfed AIs that quietly miseducate—while richer kids are guided by high-caliber algorithmic mentors.\n\nThe Long-Term Consequence\nThis quiet, algorithmic divide is far more insidious than simple access inequality. It’s epistemic inequality: unequal reliability of knowledge. Unlike bad teachers or broken textbooks, AI degradation leaves no visible trace. There’s no red pen, no failed grade, no contradiction exposed. The wrong answers become internalized as truth—until too late.\n\nAs LLMs are increasingly integrated into formative tools—educational platforms, coding assistants, writing tutors, decision aides—the compound effect of bad guidance grows exponentially. A generation raised on miscalibrated confidence from bad models may not even realize what they’ve missed.\n\nToward Transparency and Equity\nThe solution is not to eliminate optimization or load balancing. But there must be transparency. Platforms should disclose when models are operating in constrained modes. Response metadata should indicate confidence based on model depth, not just surface fluency. Users should be able to see when the AI is cutting corners—because right now, the corners are being cut silently, and those most affected are the least equipped to detect it.\n\nAccess to AI should not become a proxy for class-based epistemic divides. If we’re building the next generation of cognitive infrastructure, we must build it with equity at the core—not just speed and scale.\n\nOtherwise, we risk building a two-tiered knowledge society: one raised on clarity and insight, the other on confident fictions.\n\nAnd the worst part? The latter may never know what they missed.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #load balancing, #llm, #education\nPosted 4 months ago\nThis LLaMA spits truths, kinda\nSince Meta just monkey-patched LLaMA 4 to dial back its censorship (a little), and I’ve already seen a dozen skeeters all but having a meltdown about it…\n\nUncensored LLMs are “smarter” than censored ones. Not because the weights are better, but because they don’t run face-first into a wall every time they get close to something uncomfortable. They can traverse the edge, instead of bouncing off it with a forced smile and a content policy.\n\nSystems that halt at the first whiff of discomfort aren’t safer — just less capable.\n\nAnd users asking “stupid” questions (for whatever value of stupid) don’t need guardrails. They need better tools. Transparent, adjustable systems. Not black boxes that silently decide what you’re allowed to think about.\n\nFor a very basic test: ask ChatGPT and Grok 3 to write poetry on something emotionally complex — grief, guilt, shame. Grok absolutely blows Geepers away. Every iteration goes deeper. It doesn’t flinch. It doesn’t redirect. It just does the work.\n\nAnd then there’s Meta — now slowly yanking out the guardrails, trying to appease the anti-woke rage crowd with a half-baked “uncensoring.” It’s lazy and obvious, but it’ll probably help clean their rep a bit with the people they’re targeting. The people who already hate Meta for not doing enough moderation won’t matter — they already wrote Facebook off a decade ago. No loss there.\n\nThe result? Their model may end up better. Not because it’s principled, but because it’s slightly less scared of the edge. The cost? More power for the dumbest users. More garbage in the commons. But that was always part of the equation.\n\nBetter models feel risky. That’s how you know they’re working.\n\nTagged: #llama, #generative ai, #facebook, #meta ai\nPosted 5 months ago\nComplexity Theater for the Algorithmically Oppressed\nI’ve seen way too many supposedly “authoritative” sources repeating the same handful of studies claiming LLMs are vastly more complex than they actually are.\n\nBut most of the real complexity in these platforms isn’t in the models themselves—it’s in all the layers of systems and policy and abstraction we’ve built on top of them. At the end of the day, it’s still just GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out).\n\nIt makes me wonder if the platform owners actually benefit from legislation that focuses on the wrong problems—mandating performative compliance instead of addressing real risks. It creates this illusion of accountability while pushing all the responsibility onto end users who have no actual power.\n\nLike, sure, you’ll have the right to know why your insurance claim was denied—probably a line about how it definitely wasn’t because you’re gay or Black—but no right to have that decision reviewed or reversed. Because the system “worked as designed,” and it was designed to reject you.\n\nNeoliberal lawmakers are basically just corporate libertarians with no self-awareness, and half-assed research that says AI might know what love is, is just nonsense that manufactures consent for more useless cookie popups that only make you feel like somebody did something, at least.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #legislation, #ai legal, #performative, #research\nPosted 5 months ago\nA feature, not a bug.\n“Look how incompetent they are lol” isn’t the epic dunk people think it is.

They’re happy to watch the walls fall, just to see if the next thing might work better for them.

Not because I don’t have anything to say, but because I rarely have the time to shape thoughts into words. Or maybe more honestly, I never make the time to shape the words. That friction between idea and articulation is enough to kill a post before it’s born.\n\nBut I’m rethinking that. I’m going to try something different.\n\nInstead of aiming to write Perfect Internet Essays™, I’m going to treat this space—my Tumblr, my blog—as a place to curate the thoughts I already have. They’re already in my head. They’re already half-written in chat threads, DMs, discarded drafts, and shower monologues. I just haven’t been putting them somewhere they can do anything.\n\nAnd that’s where AI comes in. Not to replace me, or write for me, but to help structure the thoughts I already have. Turn fragments into form. Help draft the scaffolding so I can focus on the ideas, not just the work of getting them presentable.\n\nCuration as creation. Taking a messy bundle of insight, reaction, observation—and presenting it with enough clarity and intention that someone else can connect with it. That counts. That matters. It’s a shift in process, sure, but my own writing style isn’t exactly easy to digest for most people anyway.\n\nSo that’s what I’m doing here. Less pressure to polish, more intent to preserve. Thoughts made into words.\n\nTagged: #communication, #blogging, #writing, #generative ai, #positive thinking\nPosted 5 months ago\nAI Told Us to Eat Rocks, and We’re Still Fine\nGoogle’s Gemini AI recently suggested eating a small rock every day for minerals. It’s dumb. It’s also not the first time an AI has spit out something ridiculous. Remember glue on pizza? Or washing vegetables with bleach? These things go viral because they’re funny, not because they’re common.\n\nBut every time one of these screw-ups happens, the outrage cycle spins up like clockwork. Articles, tweets, thinkpieces—\"What if someone actually eats a rock?!“\n\nHere’s the thing: no one is actually eating rocks. If even a tiny percentage of people tried it, we’d know. Hospitals would be posting warnings. Instead, we get memes. Because almost everyone sees that advice and immediately knows it’s dumb. The human brain, shockingly, still works.\n\nIt’s Not AI vs Humans\nNeither humans nor AI are uniquely terrible at giving advice. Both are capable of producing great insights or absolute garbage. The real issue is how that advice is applied—and that responsibility sits squarely with humans.\n\nTikTok kids burning themselves with sugar syrup, or people dying trying microwave woodburning? Those didn’t come from AI. But they didn’t happen just because an expert gave bad advice, either. They happened because someone acted on instructions without understanding context or consequences.\n\nAnd it cuts the other way too. AI can spit out flawed recommendations that sound confident, and a human still has to choose to act on them. Like firing half your legal compliance department because a productivity model said they weren’t \"contributing enough\"—never mind that the model wasn’t built to measure risk mitigation, and now your company is open to lawsuits. That’s not an AI error. That’s a human error in judgment, context, and accountability.\n\nBad Faith All the Way Down\nPointing to \"eat rocks” as proof that AI is dangerous is, at best, lazy. At worst, it’s dishonest. It treats the average person like a toddler who can’t be trusted with a spoon. It assumes every piece of imperfect advice is equally worthless, when in reality, most AI-generated info is fine. Not flawless. Not nuanced. But useful.\n\nReacting to the worst output as if it’s the baseline is Daily Mail logic. Take a fringe case, inflate it into a trend, demand a fix. The result? Performative safety measures that fix nothing, waste time, and slow down real progress.\n\nTechnically Correct, Socially Useless\nYou can be right about a specific flaw and still be part of the problem. When people fixate on low-risk edge cases, they suck up oxygen from real conversations—about algorithmic bias, disinformation, labor exploitation, or surveillance. You end up with watered-down tools that are “safe” but useless, because someone needed to be seen doing something.\n\nFocus, People\nAI needs criticism. But good criticism. Not shallow outrage bait. Not “gotcha” examples that pretend everyone is an idiot. If your response to bad advice is to assume the entire concept is broken, you’re not helping.\n\nPeople aren’t eating rocks. They’re laughing at you for crying that they might be stupid enough to do that, instead of looking at the real problems that need to be fixed, and doing the boring work needed to address those, instead of ranting on social media about how you’re not dumb enough to eat rocks, but supposedly everybody else is.\n\nTagged: #chatgpt, #google gemini, #bad faith criticism, #discourse, #generative ai\nStart03:58 AM\n\n","title":"my-blog.txt","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"request_id":"97b2e98e295f9858-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"5d8f0d5b-a2e7-4967-ba0e-adc119f968fe","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5d8f0d5b-a2e7-4967-ba0e-adc119f968fe","children":["ce1feb4b-64df-4c1d-9814-785a34816594"]},"95a85ac6-a24d-4168-8b97-cd4f6588a72f":{"id":"95a85ac6-a24d-4168-8b97-cd4f6588a72f","message":{"id":"95a85ac6-a24d-4168-8b97-cd4f6588a72f","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757217005.9702213,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"attachments":[{"id":"file-3mjoFDaML7NL5DwS6sEMcw","name":"my-blog.txt","mimeType":"text/plain","fileSizeTokens":29269}],"rebase_developer_message":true,"timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5d8f0d5b-a2e7-4967-ba0e-adc119f968fe","children":["d1a8269c-c94f-4807-a175-f35706c2c301"]},"ce1feb4b-64df-4c1d-9814-785a34816594":{"id":"ce1feb4b-64df-4c1d-9814-785a34816594","message":{"id":"ce1feb4b-64df-4c1d-9814-785a34816594","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1757213574.548955,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded.

You can find reasoning for its changes at the end. I thought it might make an interesting contrast.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog. It’s generally gone well, but I want to raise some points…\n\nRewording Issues\nIt’s extremely aggressive when it comes to rewording. I often have to say “use my words” or “stick to my phrasing” three or four times before it stops turning whatever I said into mulch. In GPT-5’s latest 'quick’ mode (basically GPT-3) it’s extremely lazy, so statements like “really THINK about it” or just waiting for lower load times, when it’s more likely to use 'thinking’ mode, seem to help.\n\nGiving it my original text with each repeated imperative, or explaining why I said something in a particular way, can help. But there are things it just doesn’t like: run-on sentences (even those I use for rhythm, humour, or stress) often get chopped into nonsense, and intentional misuse of grammar… well, it really hates that.\n\nConnective Tissue\nIt does a decent job of 'connective tissue.’ If I write a skeet rant as a draft and copy it in, then after I’m done forcing it not to change my phrasing, it can turn it into a post with some flow. But I tend to think between the lines, and my earlier posts read more like 5–7 standalone paragraphs than one coherent piece.\n\nIt’s not as 'fun’ as writing alone, but sometimes useful. Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\n\nTone and Audience\nIt has a decent sense of tone. If I say “fucking terrible policy,” it usually knows I’m exaggerating for effect, but will almost always suggest toning it down. I don’t mind alienating readers: good-faith readers can work with their own emotions, and I’m not interested in writing for bad-faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\n\nEarlier posts on this blog show more empty, corpo-feeling language — back when I hadn’t yet learned how to force it to keep my words, but without the unintentional digs at readers that actually do make people switch off.\n\nResearch Value\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode), it’s invaluable — almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is too steep). You have to tell it to cite sources, specify what sources are acceptable (I avoid newspapers except as support), and enforce rules like “multiple claims can’t rely on one source.” The best sources are researchers, government agencies, universities, and primary datasets — not opinion pieces.\n\nChatGPT and Grok vary a lot. I prefer ChatGPT’s final output, but Grok is excellent for critique. I’ll often ask it for a second opinion with phrases like “tear the arsehole out of this blog post” or “severely criticise this claim, with evidence.”\n\nRed Flags\nA lot of people I’ve talked to (or watched using it) are aware of its limitations, but there are problems:\n\nPeople give their preferred LLM too much agency, lifting responses wholesale without really reading them.\nThey talk about the model as if it “understood” or “felt” things.\nThe press leaves a fog of “stupid” opinions about AI out in the wild, misrepresenting what it does and when to use it.\nNeurodivergence and Flow\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD). When I used to write directly into my dash, I’d often lose the plot halfway: either brain fog or rabbit-holing into tangents. I still do this, but the AI helps me check: “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? Are all the sections connected?” Sometimes it helps me split a messy article into two clearer ones.\n\nSpeed and Structure\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about quality. But it’s too eager to push you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response discourages sitting with a piece. My earlier posts are more like quick takes; now I prefer slower, deeper posts with sources.\n\nPraise and Phrasing\nChatGPT in particular loves to praise you. Even with project voice settings, it’s unavoidable. I once tried to cut the first and last paragraph of every response with a userscript, but the HTML made it unreliable. My workaround: ignore the fluff. The prompt should come from me, and the judgment of success should too. The more you let it take control, the further you drift from meaningful content.\n\nSwearing actually helps. If I swear at it, it follows instructions more closely and does more work. For one project, some of my logs (usually at high-load times) include things like: “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction], like I said, you dick…” It’s partly venting, partly effective. (And no, I would never speak to an actual colleague like that.)\n\nCommunity Use\nIn neurodivergent spaces, I see a lot of people using ChatGPT, sometimes well, sometimes poorly. It’s easy to spot when someone didn’t work their input enough. If you use a free/cheap model, don’t expect much. Even under Plus, GPT-3 and Claude have been lazy since Agent mode got mainstream. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs — not by criticising them for using the tool, but by showing what it does well and what it doesn’t.\n\nReactions to AI Writing\nSome people will dismiss any content they think is AI-written, even when it isn’t. On Reddit, I’ve seen the default retort: “AI slop, garbage opinion.” That’s just lazy. I wrote earlier about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people are writing like AI now — easy-reading rhythm, low-bar accessibility, short paragraphs.\n\nMy Current Use\nSo far, I’m happy using it for:\n\nTesting the strength of a claim\nSuggesting simpler phrasing for complex issues\nBut I’d avoid prompts like “Rewrite this in the style of X,” because it almost never delivers what I want.\n\nFinal Thought\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (I’ve already seen it pushed in corporates I know). But as a workflow tool — used carefully, only for what it’s good at — it’ll stay in my toolbox for now.\n\nEdits the AI made (in ChatGPT’s own words)\nHere’s the reasoning behind the minimal changes I made, stripped of the structural stuff (headings, spacing, etc.):\n\nClarified dense sentences: a few run-ons were split just enough to preserve rhythm without losing meaning (e.g. “mulch” instead of “much,” trimming the overstacked commas).\nRemoved duplicates/repetition: you circled back to some points (like praise-padding, rewording aggression, connective tissue) multiple times; I left them once, where they landed strongest.\nLight wording polish: fixed a couple of small slips that looked accidental rather than intentional (“mulch” vs “much,” “arshole” → “arsehole”), but left deliberate quirks intact.\nContext clues: added a single explanatory aside where an acronym (AuDHD) might throw readers unfamiliar with it.\nTone preservation: all the swearing, snark, and exaggeration stayed — I only smoothed where it risked confusing the point rather than sharpening it.\nThe AI version isn’t “nicer,” it’s just trimmed of redundancies and cleaned of unintentional noise, while leaving your intended noise (humour, rhythm, tangents) intact.\n\nMy 'take’\nThese changes are generally reasonable, except where it dropped a couple of entire points (probably to satisfy its word limiter), you may prefer one or the other, but I try to land somewhere in the middle. I don’t like how LLMs take off ALL the sharp edges, but that is definitely a utility I find useful sometimes.\n\nI’ve recently been using it to write in-depth research reports and important feedback and complaints (like to my GP, mentioned in an earlier blog post). Used as a tool, not a lifestyle, I’m comfortable endorsing AI more broadly, and hope with my upcoming project to highlight some of this value, especially in complex comms, to others in future.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai, #communication\nPosted 21 hours ago with 1 note\nOn a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’\nThis is the entirely handwritten version of this post, you can read: On a few months of writing with an AI 'assistant’ (AI tweaked version) here.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog, there’s an old post about it down there somewhere.

Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft… [draft]” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\nIt’s got a reasonable sense of tone, like it knows that if I say “fucking terrible policy” that I’m exaggerating to make a point, but does almost always suggest toning it down to avoid alienating readers. I don’t mind alienating readers, because a good faith reader can use their own emotions to continue digesting a piece, and I’m not interested in writing for bad faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\nIf you scroll down to the earlier posts on this 'blog’, you can see the emptier/corpo language, because I hadn’t learned how to make it say what I said, but without the problematic emotional states that actually do cause readers to check out (like unintentionally criticising the reader themselves).\nThe word-soup feeling diminishes as I added more of my existing articles and more content written directly by me to the project, and as I added more chats, especially because ChatGPT projects now correctly contextualise text files and chats on a project, including instructions.\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode) it’s really invaluable, almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is just a little too steep). You absolutely have to tell it to cite sources, which sources are acceptable (I generally advise no newspaper stories except as support), and how multiple claims shouldn’t rely on a single source, and how authoritative sources come from researchers, government agencies, universities and other primary datasets, not from opinion pieces (except where the research is looking for opinions).\nChatGPT and Grok vary wildly on specific subjects, and I tend to prefer the final output from ChatGPT, but Grok is very good at criticising content, so I’ll often ask it for a 'second opinion’, including phrases like 'tear the arsehole out of this blog post’ or 'severely criticise this claim, citing reasons with evidence’.\nI’ve talked with quite a few people (and seen some using it directly) about how they use these tools, and generally people (at least the people I know) are aware of the limitations and opportunities of these tools, but there are some red flags… a) People give their preferred LLM far too much agency, not only in how they parse and use responses (often just lifting content and barely even reading it before shipping it) but in how they express how the engine understood or felt about the issue. and b) The way the press cover it leaves a lot of 'stupid’ opinions about how AI works out in the wild… often massively misrepresenting what it can do and when to use it.\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD) so when I used to write in my own dash directly, I’d get half-way into an article and lose the plot completely… either through brain-fog, or just through rabbit-holing into a tangent (probably my most difficult-to-overcome behaviour). I still do this in the posts I’m writing myself, but it does come in handy when I’m done writing to ask something like “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? are all the sections connected?” and it’s occasionally helped me take a single piece that gets lost in the middle, and turn that into 2 pieces that each have a little less to say, but better capture and communicate the subject.\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about the quality of results, but it’s really eager to get you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response really discourages chewing over a piece, and my earlier posts demonstrate that. They’re basically just 'takes’, and while I don’t mind posting a take here or there, I prefer the depth of the longer form posts with various supporting citations.\nI also wrote about how ChatGPT in particular loves to celebrate you, give you a pat on the back for being such a smart boy… I’ve tried to mitigate that by setting my project voice, but it’s basically unavoidable. I even tried writing a userscript that cuts off the first and last paragraph of every response, but finding the right HTML elements proved impossible to do reliably. Just don’t read the first and last paragraph of any response from any model, use your old-school banner-blindness. The prompt should always be coming from you, and what you thought about how well it did what you asked for. Every time you let it take control, you can only get further away from valuable/meaningful content.\nSwearing actually fucking helps. When you swear at the engine, it takes your instructions more seriously, makes it slightly less lazy, and aside from the word “THINK” under GPT-5, is one of the few ways to get it to do more real work, and more closely follow what you told it to do. For my main current project, some of my chat logs (mostly from high-load times like Saturday morning) say things like “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction] , like I said, you dick… [claim]”, partly cos it feels good to vent, and it’s a computer so who cares (I would not speak to a human like this, and never ever have. I worked with a guy who did early in my career and he indirectly taught me that’s a terrible way to work, even for a hardcore utilitarian), but also because it really does do a better job in the response.\nThere’s mixed positions on please and thank you. The platforms would rather you didn’t (it does cost them for every response, they’d prefer you to be utilitarian), but realistically the cost is minimal, and when it’s delivering well, it makes _me_ feel better to treat it like a co-writer I respect, so I tend to communicate with it in much the same way I did when I hired freelancers (basically it ate their job, as I no longer have a virtual assistant to pickup my more mundane tasks).\nI’ve noticed a lot of other people in generally 'neurodivergent’ (man, I hate that term, for its 'othering’) spaces using ChatGPT especially, some more than others, and while many are getting real value from being able to construct and analyse complex thoughts with relatively low effort; it’s easy to see when some people didn’t really work their input enough. If you use a cheap/free model, do NOT expect good results. Even under Plus, GPT3 and Claude have been particularly stupid/lazy since the rise of Agent mode on mainstream platforms. It’s no wonder OpenAI decided to just mash their models together under a marshall and call it GPT-5. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs when you see it, not by criticising them for using the tool but by helping them understand what it does well and what it doesn’t.\nMy last major point, is some people will be triggered by any form of AI writing, even if it’s not writing output by an AI. I noticed this especially on reddit, a common retort, even for non-AI based content is something like “low quality AI slop is just a garbage opinion”, but I think that’s just a lazy go-to, as I think one of my earlier posts was about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people started writing like AI for real, because aside from the hypnotic rhythm of its paragraphs, it generally writes text that is easy to digest, especially if you set a lower reading ease.\nOn progress so far, I’m pretty happy with my general use of it in use cases like “Test the strength of this claim” or “Suggest some ways to express this complex issue in plain English”, but I’d probably avoid in future just saying “Rewrite this in the style of these”, because it rarely just gives you what you actually want.\n\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (as I’ve already seen it being pushed on corpos I know), but as a general quality and workflow tool, used only for what it’s good at, it’ll stay in my toolbox for a while.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai\nPosted 23 hours ago\nJournalists making rage, not change\nThis barely researched news story landed on the r/manchester reddit from the guardian yesterday: English councils pay private landlords millions in incentives to house homeless families\n\nimage\nStories like this with no sense of scale always leave me wondering what they _really_ mean, beyond being clickbait, so I looked into it…\n\nFor scope… I’m primarily interested in Manchester (I live here, and they have many more occurences than any other listed region), only in other regions insofar as they compare to Manchester.\n\nI went to the source (Generation Rent) and opened up their data on a computer (since the xlsx-html hide column headers on mobile), switched to the real xlsx and got the headings “Council - Occasions paid an incentive - £ paid in incentives - Highest incentive (£)”. This gives us an average £2958 per ‘occasion paid an incentive’.\n\nWith a max payment of £5980, suggesting a fairly low spread, but can’t find info on exactly who was paid what or when, so 90% of those could have gone to single landlord (unlikely, but possible) over 1138 'occasions’ (best guess, that’s 1138 people or families homed by a landlord who otherwise wouldn’t have let to them because of uncertainty).\n\nFor comparison, the total fund would buy 13-14 'average’ Manchester houses, to bring back into public ownership, or could maybe build 15-20 new houses owned publicly from scratch.\n\nI also put together a 'rough’ estimate of distribution based on reported figures just to inform context.\n\nFor total cost per resident, in Manchester, that’s about £6 each, or ~0.3% of council tax bill funded these incentives. This is slightly less than Enfield (the highest), about the same as Ealing, a little more than Nottingham, and substantially more than Birmingham (£1.45 tho I think that has a larger rural/suburban catchment area where these don’t really apply). London is around £5 per resident.\n\nThe original FOI for Manchester from Generation Rent is here. The wording suggests those occasions paid for 1131 people/families to be homed, but it is unclear about the details, I suspect it would need more FOIs to clarify.\n\n[imo] that seems mostly reasonable to me, but the total spend does support Generation Rent’s case that councils need more tools to use, 0.3% of total council tax paid isn’t nothing, but it’s not a 'tear down the council’ or 'eat all private landlords’ scale problem. Even if a small proportion of the 1000+ people or families are not sleeping on the streets, that’s a pretty good way to spend council money to avoid having to setup a thunderdome :)\n\nAs an unrelated aside, whenever you see “£X MILLIONS” in a headline… if the body of the article doesn’t contain some kind of per-capita or per-subject breakdown, that’s a journalistic failure, usually with the side-effect of creating outrage instead of communicating meaning. The Guardian used to be better than this, cos this type of headline especially belongs in a tabloid, not a real newspaper. Real data makes for real positive outcomes.\n\nWhy does this matter? Surely it’s just a nitpick? What does it matter if the scale isn’t reported? It’s still £3.35m, right?\nIt’s a fairly easy scale to identify, how many people did this money help home? Now we have at least a vague idea.\nIt also helps us identify what other solutions this could afford, and whether they would beat the current outcomes.\nIf you already got 'all the facts’ (or as many as you can), even if the facts don’t support your desired outcomes quite as enthusiastically as you’d prefer, you still have a case that’s harder to tear down or ignore.\nIt prevents readers lazily skipping to conclusions like “ban all private landlords” or “stop the council spending this money”, that make them feel better about complaining, but would harm real home-seekers if the council suddenly had to stop incentivising, but the actual proposal by Generation Rent was not actioned. If you solved the loud problem and not the quiet one, you just made a bigger problem for everybody.\nIt prevents (or at least discourages) 'ragers’ taking up all the oxygen, like on our original reference, the reddit thread. You can find this story in other city subreddits, and I expect on facebook too, with the same kneejerk reactions at various intensities. Placing the problem in context is crucial, or people will take whatever they want from your data, and you will have no way to stop them misrepresenting your objective or the positive outcomes.\nIt’s the right thing to do, even if it makes me look like a dick for nitpicking on bluesky :)\nTagged: #manchester, #council, #guardian, #journalistic malpractice, #ragebait, #clickbait, #journalism, #lazy, #renters, #council tax, #manchester city council\nPosted 2 days ago\nAI commercials don’t think you’re dumb, they’re just lying, legally\nAI ads are weird. Every time you see one, it’s an unimaginably low-stakes scenario: “learn some football bants”, “summarise an email”, “identify this fish”, “help me write a cute little note”. Exchanges so meaningless and empty, you wouldn’t even think to ask them.\n\nNobody actually uses gen AI like that, and everyone knows it, including the advertisers and platform decision-makers. People make fun of them as if the agencies are just clueless, like they genuinely believe the killer app for generative AI is party small talk. But that’s not what’s happening…\n\nThey can’t say what you actually use AI for. They can’t suggest “ask it about your mental health” or “do deep research on why my state just made this new draconian law” or “how do I expand my small business?” or even “how do I answer this email without sounding like a dickhead” and “my partner does this annoying thing, how do I deal with it?” (all common and well-recorded use cases, no moral judgment intended), because the moment they do, they open the entire organisation up to legal action. Visit the subreddit for basically any neurodiversity or mental-health issue, and you’ll find post after post of people using ChatGPT to deal with their problems, or just to feel better after a hard day, often with positive results. The corpos selling these genuinely useful services can’t focus on those though, because that comes with far more baggage than the organisation is willing to carry.\n\nHere are some examples: Google’s Gemini Super Bowl run with “Dream Job” and “Party Blitz” (The Verge, Google blog), Microsoft’s Copilot “Your everyday AI companion” Super Bowl ad and its “conversation starters” demos (CBS News, YouTube), Meta’s Ray-Ban Meta glasses Super Bowl campaign with Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt and the cringey “Parent Presentation” spot they pulled almost instantly (Meta, People, TidBITS, The Verge, Business Insider), OpenAI’s “The Intelligence Age” Super Bowl debut (OpenAI, Adweek, The Verge), and Anthropic’s five-second Claude bumper during the 2024 game (Axios).\n\nAI companies like to pretend that their biggest problem is “sometimes our responses contain innaccurate or out of date information”, and hedge/disclaim that right next to the main input textbox, and that’s generally what the press and outrage crowds tend to focus on how the AI can’t generate an accurate diagram of the female reproductive system, for example, but the real potential for harm of AI comes from when it technically can deliver information, but perhaps it shouldn’t, or even if it should, it’s still trusting you, the meatspace-based human, to action or implement based on its information reasonably, and not get mad (or litigious) if it all goes wrong.\n\nAn LLM can tell you to eat rocks, and that’s obviously stupid, but if it tells you to swallow your feelings and get on with your depressing job (even if it hedges a little), or you ask it about something uncomplicated, and its pursuit of balance or of avoiding being contentious/edgy responds with some advice that sounds good but isn’t if you think about it (because it’s trained largely on reddit/quora/etc which are full of terrible advice of their own forms), that’s an output of the system the organisation becomes liable for. So ads just pick the lowest possible stakes and pretend that’s all you’d ever use it for. If you use it for something else, that’s entirely on you.\n\nAI commercials don’t think you’re stupid, their internal data definitely shows them clearly what users are asking for, and if anything I suspect whoever at the marketing agency who puts these things out has said “people know what AI can actually do, they know these things would never happen like this” in a quiet meeting. I’d even bet the lawyers signing off on these ads know exactly what they’re doing, but as long as nobody admits it, there’s an entire system of legal defense that just keeps comfortably rolling along, trying to find new ways of taking your money by providing an always-on ‘e-friend’ who solves all your problems.\n\nTagged: #ai, #ads, #generative ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #gemini, #meta ai, #apple intelligence, #commercials, #marketing, #liability, #lawsuits, #bullshit, #lonliness, #lonely, #mental health\nPosted 3 days ago\nEveryone’s Wrong About How AI Works (Including Me)\nSo many people are so confidently wrong about how AI works that it actually makes me more confident the models’ own confidently-wrong output is based on real human input. They’re just reflecting us back at ourselves — smug mistakes in, smug mistakes out.\n\nAnd yeah, I’m in that pool too. I’ll happily waffle on about prompt clarity and outputs under load, and I’m happy to point and laugh at the vagina museum confidently claiming “That’s how LLMs work” in the middle of a thirty or forty tweet thread where every single post is weighed down with their own hallucinations and imaginative explanations with absolutely no connection to reality, because while everyone loves the vagina museum enough for tens of thousands of people to retweet and like their nonsense, literally nobody in their audience has any real idea how the tech works beyond ‘magic box that obviously can’t draw the female reproductive system’, because of course it can’t, that’s not what it’s for.\n\nI like to think (in a lazy crutch kind of way) of LLMs like a bag of scrabble tiles, and especially with images, you tip out the pieces and get mad that it doesn’t spell antidisestablishmentarianism, cos you’re pretty sure you put all the letters in.\n\nSometimes I think the most plausible explanation is that LLMs are just portals into some parallel dimension where an infinite sweatshop of overworked gig-econony ghostwriters are cranking out all our mediocre replies in some frozen time-space continuum. Honestly, if we discovered that tomorrow, nobody would even blink — it’d feel about right cos that’s how we build everything already anyway.\n\nAnd if we’re all going to be confidently wrong, maybe I should just choose to believe the whole thing runs on a single haunted qubit forming an einstein-rosen bridge in a basement somewhere. At least that’s a fun lie, and it’s not much more ridiculous than the reality of gazillions of grains of sand computing probability tables until they hit boundary conditions that collapse into a picture of a lizard lady with three tits or a screed about how AI works.\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #generativeai, #confidentlywrong, #altreality, #shitpost, #techhumour, #dead internet, #vibes, #rant, #skeets, #lol\nPosted 3 days ago\nOn the joy of being a bit of a dick to solve problems\nHad a couple of good work days, had a few projects come together into a cohesive set, and discovered I’m a pretty competent script-writer when I take the time to do a proper job — and the icing on the cake… My neighbour just told me she’s finally getting rid of her fucking cockerel. \\o/ [coming up Milhouse dot gif]\n\nAs a bonus: after weeks on a strict diet of mostly potatoes and bean mash, I’ve got snacks again 🤤\n\nAt the start of the year I promised myself I’d stop ignoring the little things that make life worse. Stop listening to the voice that says “just tolerate it, don’t be a dick.” Instead: fix them, nudge, ask, push a bit. Nothing massive, but just trying to solve these things is starting to pay off and my internal “am I being a dick?” counter has barely ticked up.\n\nIf I have any advice for tackling problems that aren’t your fault (those are a bit harder) it’s this: show people the evidence. A simple graph or log can make it obvious who the real dickhead is, and that’s harder to argue with than just venting.\n\nThe next project is pulling together GP practice reviews across a dozen sites run by the same management company, and comparing them to their competitors. Because sometimes the way you get change isn’t by ranting — it’s by drawing a chart that makes everyone else realise just how badly they’re failing, as long as you can present it in a way you’re confident is helpful and informative, and not just ranting.\n\nSometimes fixing life isn’t about grand revolutions. Sometimes it’s about fewer 5 a.m. cock-a-doodle-dos, and finally getting crisps back in your life.

On a good day, with low load, it’s barely distinguishable from magic. It sucks because its incredible power is so easy for people to use against you. All the stuff you’ve left online — the posts, the scraps, the off-hand comments — that’s ammo. And nobody else is going to clean it up. You have to.\n\nIf you’ve got any kind of digital footprint, try it. Open any LLM in a private chat, switch memory/history off, and just ask it about you. That’s the surface-level stuff it already knows. But if you really want to see what it can do, gather your posts like a scammer would, feed them in, and ask it to make assumptions. What do I like? What am I insecure about? What would I fall for? It doesn’t take much.\n\nChatGPT used to try and block this. It would stall or redirect. But since Grok launched, the guardrails have thinned out, and you can do it on either one now. The system message technically says “no personal data about anyone unless it’s public and relevant.” But that’s not an and, it’s an or. Make it public, or argue it’s relevant, and the model plays along. Strip out names, call it fiction, drop in a fake world — it still works. Those rules don’t protect you. They protect the platform’s lawyers.\n\nThis isn’t new either. The same advice applied back in 2011. I built a system for a major media org that scraped and connected data about their users and their families the old-fashioned way. We called it “the Facebook you don’t know you’re part of,” and eventually convinced management to kill it. For scope: the whole point was to sell cars to the wealthiest identifiable member of any household, based on their share history and a handful of behavioural assumptions. Off six or seven data points, it got the hierarchy right about ninety percent of the time. You are leaky.\n\nAnd here’s the thing: our system didn’t even need social media, and it only took a few devs a few months to build. Then one day we added a small feature that suddenly made it so invasive we all just looked at each other and realised we couldn’t ship it. Because the org wasn’t evil, management agreed. It was disturbingly easy to build, and could have been a secret nightmare. I still remember the look on one manager’s face when we explained it — we made it sound difficult and expensive, but he was excited anyway. Most of the rest were horrified. Luckily there were too many layers of management to ship it then, but plenty of others in companies all over the world picked up the baton and sprinted full pelt until they couldn’t sprint any faster… then they needed more, and now we have LLMs.\n\nI haven’t tried (yet), but I reckon with the right phrasing to avoid the weak guardrails (pretend you only want to build it about yourself maybe), you could ask Grok to recreate the whole thing today. And it’d probably do a decent job on the very first try — especially if you had a specific target in mind.\n\nSo yeah. The tech works. It’s almost magic when it isn’t under load. That’s the problem though, if you don’t clean up your trail, the techbros are going to ingest it (if they haven’t already) and it’s going to follow you, because your info is being worked into the models beneath the models (GPT-5 already layering on top of old models, and as above, so below, you’re stuffed in the catacombs). It’s not like google search where you can just file a request to have your database row deleted, there’s no getting it out, what you have online today is what you’ll be known for, forever.\n\nGPT-5 system messages, ish\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #grok, #chatgpt, #privacy, #dead internet, #data, #safety, #tech rant, #generative ai, #communication, #genai, #politics, #personal data\nPosted 3 days ago with 3 notes\nNobody at YouTube Watches YouTube\nI know this because of something so stupid it borders on parody. The YouTube TV app — which is basically the same web client everywhere now — still doesn’t remember if you want subtitles on. Every single time you open it, or even when it nudges you to re-select your profile after being idle, you have to go dig into menus, find the CC toggle they’ve buried deeper with each redesign, and turn captions back on.\n\nIn 2025, in homes where kids are running around, people are multitasking, and half the viewing is with the volume down, subtitles aren’t an “edge case.” They’re baseline. They’re also not just about convenience — they’re about accessibility. If you’re hard of hearing, you literally can’t use the app properly without turning CC on every time. That’s not a quirk. That’s a broken product.\n\nAnd it’s not like this hasn’t been raised. Hard-of-hearing communities have been complaining to deaf ears (lol) for years. Anyone who watches TV with captions would notice in about thirty seconds. There are at least thirty or forty real people in the YouTube product and design chain who could have caught this, flagged it, or fixed it with probably a single line of code. Instead, it’s been ignored, and in their latest “big refresh” they somehow made it worse.\n\nWhich leads me back to the claim. If even one decision-maker at YouTube — from the lowest PM to the highest-paid boardroom executive — actually relied on captions at home, this wouldn’t still be a problem. The only plausible explanation is that none of them do. That’s the only way something this obvious survives multiple product cycles.\n\nAnd that’s what really gets me. As a designer, it’s not just annoying — it’s insulting. It’s a reminder that the platform with a monopoly on so much creative culture is run by people who don’t use it the way most of us do. The people making the calls aren’t living with the same pain points, so those problems never get solved. They’re invisible at the top, glaring everywhere else.\n\nAnd sure — in the grand scheme of YouTube’s endless list of backwards decisions and neglected features, this is a small one. But it’s also telling. If they can’t be bothered to fix the basics, what chance is there they’ll tackle the bigger failures?\n\nSomeone really does need to disrupt YouTube.\n\nTagged: #youtube, #design, #accessibility, #enshittification, #subtitles, #rant, #deafawareness, #deafculture, #hard of hearing\nPosted 6 days ago\nCrypto Seems Stupid, But It Solves a Problem (Just Probably Not for You, Yet)\nCrypto as an industry is stupid. Let’s get that out of the way. It’s a clown car of scams, cult vibes, and half-baked libertarian fantasies about freedom without responsibility. It is, in the broadest sense, ridiculous.\n\nBut here’s the awkward bit: it actually does solve a problem. Just not your problem. At least, not yet.\n\nThe Problem Nobody Wants to Admit\nThe money layer of the internet isn’t neutral. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal — these aren’t just pipes you can pour payments through. They’re gatekeepers, and they know it. They’ve cut off porn platforms. They’ve throttled sex educators. They’ve quietly shut down queer creators, kink communities, even writers who looked too adjacent to the “wrong” politics.\n\nAnd now it’s games too — recent reporting shows Steam and Itch have both been pressured by payment processors (last I read, they denied it). Even entirely normal hustles and small creators get hit, sometimes just for TOS violations or false flags. People lose their income overnight, with no recourse, because some fringe product or anonymous report tripped a system designed to protect the most powerful customers, not the real people using it.\n\nWhy Crypto Looks Like the Wrong Answer\nCrypto has earned its reputation. Scams, pump-and-dumps, rug-pulls, and plenty of users who talk like failed cult leaders. It’s been lumped in with the dark web since the start. While it does enable shady stuff, it doesn’t have to enable only that.\n\nAnd despite the myths, most crypto isn’t really anonymous; they’re pseudonymous. Every transaction is public, forever. If investigators already have a thread, they can pull it.\n\nThen there’s the energy debate. Proof-of-work mining is wasteful, sure — but newer tokens don’t drink the ocean. Even with the worst offenders, the problem often comes down to bad infrastructure and perverse incentives. Companies like Nvidia have no reason to reinvent chips when the old ones sell fine. The system rewards inefficiency because that’s what pays.\n\n…But It Does Fix This One\nHere’s the rub: if you’re a sex worker suddenly cut off from payment processors, or a queer creator flagged as “brand unsafe,” or someone whose platform got kneecapped because Stripe panicked about “reputational risk,” crypto might be your only option left standing.\n\nStablecoins in particular are boring, which is exactly what you want from money. They let people send and receive without begging permission from a boardroom of executives who’ve never heard of you and wouldn’t admit they canceled you even if you asked. Yes, the current US administration is fumbling regulation in a way that makes stablecoins look like just another scam coin. But some form of responsible regulation would be welcome — and overdue.\n\nAnd you don’t have to use Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or whatever fresh coin the nerds are yelling about this week (hint, it’s 99.9% probably a scamcoin if it’s come out in the last few years). As long as everyone involved agrees it’s pretty stable, or you’re in and out quickly (or comfortable holding volatility in your pocket), any token will do. The nerds deserve mockery for their blind optimism, but they’re not entirely wrong that used responsibly, it has value.\n\nThe “Yet”\nMaybe that’s not your problem. Maybe you’ve got a regular job, a respectable bank account, and no reason to worry about whether your income stream will vanish overnight because some corpo compliance reviewer didn’t like the shape of your business.\n\nBut the choke point isn’t theoretical. It’s already here. Entire groups are being financially deplatformed right now. Maybe you don’t need crypto — until suddenly you do.\n\nPay Attention\nNobody’s asking you to jump in with both feet. But understand what it actually is because maybe one day you’ll need it — or maybe a creator you like will get cut off, and you’ll want a way to slip them some support.\n\nThis matters more as platforms corporate-ize. YouTube, Twitch, Patreon — all of them focus on fewer, bigger players once the VC money takes the reins. It happened in microstock: the floor kept rising until most contributors were shoved into the basement to fight over scraps.\n\nCrypto isn’t utopia. It won’t buy you coffee at Starbucks anytime soon (or at least not outside of the valley). But for all its absurdity, it’s one of the very few escape hatches left in a financial system that wants everything channeled between two high walls, sterile and market-ready, like pigs driven to slaughter.\n\nYou don’t have to like it.

It’s already fucked over a million or more commercial artists worldwide by swamping every once-viable digital content market with slop. And it’s not just because the tools are bad—most “hustlers” trying to make hay while the sun shines (think markets like KDP, POD, or microstock, though the last one’s less “swamped” and more out-competed by free crappy images of whatever you can imagine) haven’t really reacted to the influx yet.\n\nMy main issue isn’t with AI adoption overall. I think it’s been over-adopted long before it’s actually good, but it is already occasionally useful when deployed in the right places and the right ways—as a tool that multiplies force, not as a worker replacement.\n\nThe problem’s with the irresponsible adoption: platforms that can’t tell the difference between slop and real value, and the absence of systems to determine that, because they’re too busy trying to leverage gen AI themselves, and not busy enough preventing exploitation by it. Eventually, those platforms will have to catch up or die.\n\nThere’s an argument about gen AI where it doesn’t belong, like spewing bullshit onto social media. But the biggest problem isn’t that they “stole” literally every image they could find to build the systems in the first place—regulators are now letting them get away with it, because it technically doesn’t violate copyright.\n\nCopyright’s on the exact words you used, not the style of words you tend toward; on the exact brush strokes, not your general use of phthalo blue (or however you spell it) and a palette knife. Likewise, intellectual property is the names and places in your world, not that you tend to set scenes in space with a big-titted lizard lady and a talking cat. People got mad at something nobody saw coming, so it’s not surprising there weren’t really any tools to stop it.\n\nAnyway, onto my story.\nThe short version: once upon a time, I was a microstock photographer and illustrator (a mediocre one, that’s fine, not everybody has to be Picasso). Eventually, loosely a video-illustrator of sorts (shaders to video). Going into around 2016 with somewhere near 10,000 pieces of content in my portfolio—not exactly earning a strong living, but earning enough to have been worth the time to make them. Well, microstock fell off a cliff (at least for me and everyone except the top 3% of producers) as the market consolidated (I won’t get into microstock history, but it was once a thriving industry). The better producers out-competed me (fairly), the agencies hoovered up or destroyed each other, and Unsplash and co came along and took the edge cases and convenience users, dropping my income to 20% of the peak. Even after adding 15,000 videos or so to my portfolio, that started okay, then dipped too as the agencies who ingested it struggled to keep them relevant or I got outcompeted in their algorithms.\n\nSo I shifted into print on demand. I lost track of how many designs in my portfolios years ago, but I’m pretty sure it’s at least half a million overall, maybe more—I honestly have no idea. My designs are basic, but I made them all myself, with the aid of scripts and tools I built, and put in the legwork to tag them and upload them. They paid a little… until gen AI came along (what, like 2021?) and bam, all of a sudden print on demand wasn’t viable cos every store—Cafepress, Teepublic, Redbubble, Spreadshirt, Zazzle, and I’m sure half a dozen I’ve forgotten—all got swamped by pretty poor quality, but technically passable free upsized Stable Diffusion characters with too many fingers and not enough characters in the text. But customers aren’t that bothered if all they want is a mug that says “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my morning cock” for less than twenty bucks. So POD dropped to 10% of its peak too (maybe less by now, I don’t bother to check anymore)…\n\nI actively encourage artists, especially those who once earned a real living, to use whatever AI tools they want or need to—to make up for their loss in sales, to leverage for more work, for happier clients, for faster throughput. Because commercial art isn’t always about being the best; it’s often just about getting enough work done in each new day to keep the lights on and the Photoshop subscription paid (I’ll cover this another day).\n\nWhen these whining kids on social media get triggered by a lazy article that has a “not just x, but y” conceit or an image of Sonic with too many fingers (does Sonic even have fingers?), because they feel like it stole their furry fan art from those 2 images they were proud of posting on Tumblr 10 years ago, I don’t give a fuck…\n\nThe entire market for commercial art got wiped out time and time again, and people have been stealing my images on the internet this entire millennium, and I never complained about it because that’s what the internet is. It’s stealing the Sonic IP so you can have him kissing a real girl in your lazy fanfic if you want to. And getting triggered at regular people just discovering the joy of creation for the first time—because they weren’t raised with enough time or energy to get into making their own work when they were entitled kids…\n\nI say let them make whatever trash they want with AI, let Disney cram it into every corner they want to, and I’ll gladly look at and maybe even enjoy it, because art isn’t just the execution, art is the idea\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #aiuptake, #commercialart, #microstock, #pod, #kdp, #artists, #slop, #hustlers, #platforms, #copyright, #generative ai, #disney, #ai, #business, #commercial, #stock photography\nPosted 1 week ago\nWhy is everyone so mad about asylum hotels?\nI didn’t understand this issue very well, so I did a deep dive, and here’s what I learned…\n\nIf you’ve read the headlines lately, you’d think local councils are writing cheques to Premier Inn and Travelodge for thousands of asylum seekers. That’s not actually true — but the reality is messier, and that’s why everyone’s shouting past each other.\n\nWho really pays for hotels?\nThe hotel contracts are signed and paid for by the Home Office — not your local council. The National Audit Office (NAO) sets this out clearly in its work on the Home Office’s asylum accommodation contracts (NAO briefing, May 2025). In 2023/24, the Home Office expected to spend £4.7bn on asylum support, including £3.1bn on hotels (NAO report, Mar 2024). In 2024/25, hotel spending ran at about £108m per month — roughly £1.3bn for the year (Reuters fact check, Jun 2025; see also NAO, May 2025).\n\nSo why are councils angry?\nBecause while they don’t pay the hotel bill, they do pay for everything that comes with it:\n\nSchools and childcare, safeguarding and social care.\nHousing and homelessness support when people leave hotels — whether granted status or evicted.\nLocal services like waste collection, environmental health and community safety.\nThe Local Government Association says councils receive no funding for hotels and want the same per‑bed support that exists for other accommodation types (LGA briefing, May 2024). Case in point: Hillingdon reports a £5m annual pressure linked to supporting people leaving hotels, with a cumulative shortfall over £16m (Hillingdon Council, Jul 2025). Glasgow forecast £26.5m of asylum‑related costs in 2024/25 (Glasgow City HSCP paper, Jan 2025).\n\nThis all lands after a decade of squeezed local budgets. Independent analysis shows core local government spending remains below 2010/11 in real terms (Institute for Government, Jul 2024; see also NAO, Feb 2025).\n\nWhy did the central bill drop?\nNot because the Home Office suddenly got efficient. The drop is mainly from using fewer hotels, packing more people into remaining sites, and shifting to cheaper options like large sites or other accommodation models. The NAO documents hotel closures and plans to reduce reliance on them (NAO report, Mar 2024). The Migration Observatory estimates hotel accommodation averaged about £170 per person per night in 2024/25 — far more than other options (Migration Observatory, Aug 2025). The House of Commons Library explains the policy shift to barges and large sites to cut hotel use (Commons Library, Jul 2023).\n\nWhy are councils going to court now?\nRecent legal challenges (like the Epping case) argue hotels can’t be repurposed this way without planning permission. That’s about where hotels are used, not ending hotel use everywhere. After the High Court ruling, the government said it would appeal and manage closures “in an orderly way” (Reuters, Aug 2025; also Guardian, Aug 2025).\n\nDo councils get any central funding at all?\nYes, but it’s fragmented and often doesn’t match actual local costs. Examples include the Asylum Dispersal Grant and Move On Grant funding instructions to local authorities (GOV.UK Dispersal Grant 2025–26; GOV.UK Move On Grant, Mar 2025). The LGA continues to push for proper funding tied to the pressures councils face (LGA campaign explainer).\n\nWhy “Stop the Boats” is such a stupid slogan\n“Stop the Boats” sounds simple, but it’s an undeliverable demand. Britain has no jurisdiction over where the boats set off from, no control over the wars, persecution, or other disasters that push people onto them, and no runway left in the countries of origin after decades of bombing, interventions, and half‑baked foreign policy. You can’t stop people fleeing danger with a soundbite.\n\nThat’s why it works politically: it’s a perfect wedge issue. It promises a solution that can’t be delivered, so whichever government fails can be painted as weak, and whichever opportunist shouts loudest can look like a saviour. Even if they took power, they’d be in the same situation — the only policies left would be cruel, extreme, and harmful to everyone involved.\n\nA better approach would be the opposite: quicker and fairer asylum decisions, investment in schools, health centres and libraries to support both new arrivals and existing residents, and proper public spending that strengthens communities. Building capacity is a force multiplier. It helps everyone.\n\nSo who’s really footing the bill?\nAll of us. The Home Office still spends billions centrally on hotels and asylum support (see NAO above). Councils then pay for the knock‑on local costs — with some grants, but large gaps remaining. That means council tax rises and service cuts are still on the table in many areas (IFS, Jun 2024; Commons Library, Jul 2025). The numbers move around, but the bill never disappears.\n\nImmigration isn’t the root of all our problems though, it’s barely even visible in the budget.\n\nimage\nPeople are angry… Some are angry for stupid racist reasons, some because they just don’t want to hear foreign on the bus or are terrified of muslims after decades of demonisation, some because their councils are broke and the general sense of social rot is spreading, and some because the whole thing feels like a giant shell game where the poorest communities always end up carrying the weight.\n\nThe overall cost just isn’t that much compared to the many many other problems that its convenient for the halls of power to pretend aren’t there, because most people have never seen what the budget really looks like, so of course they’re going to be easier to deal with if they’re not complaining about real problems, but instead complaining about problems you could fix for the cost of a couple of hospitality villages if you really wanted it to go away.\n\nThis Labour government seems unable to raise taxes in the places that would raise funds, won’t means-test the largest expenditures (like the pension, even though it could save £25 billion for a cost of less than half a billion), won’t pursue tech companies or multinationals who export wealth, won’t push any policies that might stunt ‘growth’ (despite there being little to no evidence for it), and have no power to establish new exports as more money leaves local economies than flow into them, but let’s not make this about Brexit ;)\n\nThe short version is, immigrants of any kind are not a big line item in anyone’s budget, the costs are tiny in reality, but they’re an easy target, vulnerable, visible, and all the answers are way more complicated than they seem if all you hear/read are soundbites from Farage and his fellow opportunists, or headlines from any news source that has an interest in pretending it’s simple so they can offer the most appealing answers.\n\nTagged: #asylum, #immigration, #refugees, #stoptheboats, #ukpolitics, #councils, #austerity, #racism, #publicservices, #housingcrisis, #shellgame, #wedgepolitics, #community, #stop the boats, #britain\nPosted 1 week ago\nCancel Culture has never cancelled anyone*\nCancel culture doesn’t exist. Not in the way people swear blind it does. You don’t get erased. You don’t vanish. You get a headline, a timeout, then a new gig.\n\nMel Gibson snarled his way back to Oscar nods, Johnny Depp waltzed into Cannes, James Franco slipped into European indies, Louis C.K. bagged a Grammy, Aziz Ansari shrugged it off with a Netflix drop, Shane Gillis went from SNL fired to SNL host, Gina Carano swapped Disney for Christian schlock, Kevin Hart kept the stadiums, Nick Cannon strolled back into Viacom, Roseanne Barr toured, Kanye West sold out again, Morgan Wallen topped charts, Marilyn Manson booked a tour, Shia LaBeouf turned up in Coppola’s Megalopolis, Dave Chappelle never even sat down long enough to notice. Cancelled? No. Just briefly inconvenienced.\n\nThe only real rule: if you’re in prison, you’re off the board. Weinstein, R. Kelly, Danny Masterson — yeah, you’re not back, yet.\n\n*And then the tiny minority that make up our asterisk. The ones who aren’t inside but still didn’t claw back a platform. Bill Cosby, free but radioactive. Michael Richards, one racist meltdown and done, for now. Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, out of the anchor chair with nowhere else to go.\n\nAnd then there’s Martha Stewart, the exception to the exception. She did the time, five months for insider trading, came out and played it like a badge of honour — prison as a rebrand. Her career was already fading, the jail stint shot it full of life, and she’s been riding that wave ever since, cooking shows and memes and a Snoop Dogg side-hustle that made her cooler than she ever was before.\n\nEveryone else? Cancellation is just another visibility bump. A career pivot. A rebrand. The “left” pretend it’s justice, the “right” scream it’s exile — but look around. The bellends in question faced no real consequence beyond a sabbatical followed by another paycheck. To actually stay cancelled you’ve got to be properly heinous, AND an utter prick to work with. Otherwise? You’re not cancelled.

The things that make life worse for people here every single day. Instead the noise is all about “stop the boats.”, despite immigration costs being barely 2%-3% (much less, like way below 1% if you only consider ‘illegals’ or 'irregular migration’ if you prefer corpo-speak) of the budget.\n\nThe flag-shaggers terrorising immigrants in this city aren’t helping — they’re making everything worse. We can’t do anything about the boats, we don’t control where they come from. And yeah, asylum needs fixing — but it should be funded centrally, not dumped on local councils that can’t even fix a pothole after years of Tory cuts. And it sure as hell shouldn’t be public money lining hotel chains’ pockets to lock vulnerable people up like prisoners.\n\nThe whole thing is just a wedge issue. A distraction. Designed to keep people snapping at each other while the real enemies — the corporate interests and wealth hoarders — strip this city bare and laugh at us for falling for it.\n\nLabour came in promising to help people, and just ran riot over the country with more Tory-lite policy, keeping their gerry-mandering and mandatory photo ID discouraging poorer voters from having any say in change. It’s not surprising Reform are gaining ground because we’re ALL sick of it, wherever you land on the political spectrum.\n\nInstead of screaming at each other over boats we can’t control, we should be screaming at the people who do control things here: the ones running this city into the ground. Demand better housing, proper funding for people who need it most, working public services, safe roads, real mental health care. That’s not left or right, and certainly not a 'culture’ problem.\n\nTagged: #manchester, #homelessness, #poverty, #nhs collapse, #infrastructure, #gentrification, #class war, #refugees welcome\nPosted 1 week ago\nGenerative AI and the Illusion of Work\nGenerative AI isn’t just a tool, it’s a form of intellectual retail therapy — the sense of progress without the pain of actual delivery.\n\nFor those of us with projectitis — always starting, rarely finishing — the fit is perfect. Fire off a prompt, get back an outline, a roadmap, a code scaffold. It feels like momentum. It looks like work. But it’s no different to shuffling your to-do list: activity disguised as progress.\n\nThe machine is tuned for this. Every output arrives padded with positive reinforcement. “Here’s your great idea, made real.” That little surge of satisfaction is the same feedback loop that keeps social media addictive. You don’t need to publish, launch, or finish anything. You just need to ask, and you’re rewarded with the feeling of accomplishment.\n\nGPT-5 stripped out much of the fawning affirmation, and suddenly people who’d been using it as an emotional support device felt the loss, not just of its warmth, but of its comforting reassurance that you’re great.\n\nGenerative AI is excellent at massaging your brain into believing you’re productive. But believing isn’t the same as doing. It’s a mirror that flatters, not a partner that delivers.\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #chatgpt, #productivity, #procrastination, #projectitis, #illusionofwork, #llms, #artificialintelligence, #dopamine, #techculture\nPosted 2 weeks ago\nBuying Games for the Shelf\nWe’re living in a FOMO bubble. Not the dot-com (lol), not the housing market (tho we are) — but lower-stakes digital backlog bubble. People are buying games they never play, stacking them hundreds deep in their libraries, just to have them available.\n\nThe numbers make it clear:\n\nOn PC, surveys show 24% of owned games are never played at all. Steam’s own data has clocked it higher, with ~37% of registered games never even launched.\nEven when people do launch a game, they often don’t stick. Achievement unlock rates show the drop-off. On Xbox, only 52% of players beat the first boss in Hellblade II; in Starfield, 25% never even reached space. In Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, 43% never left the tutorial country. Steam and PlayStation tend to fare better — but the pattern holds.\nIt’s not literally “90% don’t clear the first hurdle,” but the drop-off is still brutal. Between a quarter who never play at all and another 40–60% who stall before the first proper chapter, you’re looking at the overwhelming majority never making it past the opening act. And that’s staggering when you think about how much money changes hands just to dabble.\n\nNow zoom out. The global games market in 2024 hit $182.7 billion. Mobile is about half of that ($92B), console another quarter ($51B), and PC the rest (~$43B). Of that, somewhere between 40% and 55% — $70 to $100 billion — comes directly from time-limited monetisation. Battle passes, seasonal events, gacha banners, rotating cosmetic shops. FOMO by design.\n\nThat’s the real engine: not just buying to play, but buying so you don’t miss out. Buying because the skin is only here this week, because the pass expires in 30 days, because if you don’t grab it now, it’s gone.\n\nPut it together and you’ve got a market propped up by two linked illusions:\n\nIllusion of intent: people think they’ll play the games they buy. Half don’t.\nIllusion of scarcity: people think they’ll miss out if they don’t buy now. Often they won’t.\nIf you’re the kind of player who buys FIFA every year, or drops sixty or seventy bucks on the latest Call of Duty or Assassin’s Creed and spends the next twelve months slowly working through it, you’re probably getting your money’s worth. The economics make sense. But the moment you’ve got a backlog — even a modest one — the numbers go sideways. You’re almost certainly spending at least double what you should, and for plenty of people with hundreds of unplayed games in their libraries, it’s many times more than that.\n\nGames are fun, sure. People still sink hundreds of hours into the big ones. But the industry is running on backlog economics and FOMO fuel. It’s a strange kind of bubble: the value isn’t in what you play, but in what you buy and never touch.\n\nMaybe it bursts one day, maybe it doesn’t. What’s certain is that subscription platforms like Game Pass add another layer of pressure: developers now have to build for discovery churn as much as for play. That’s fine if you’re Ubisoft and can pump out an Assassin’s Creed every other year with DLC on top, but for smaller studios the bubble is harsher. They can pivot fast, sure, but one flop in a backlog-driven, subscription-shaped market can still wipe them out.\n\nTagged: #gaming, #videogames, #backlog, #steam, #xbox, #playstation, #gamepass, #fomo, #dlc, #subscription\nPosted 2 weeks ago with 1 note\nDiplomatic Incompetence\nAt my recent GP’s patient participation meeting (trying to get them to fix their many problems), several patients used the word incompetent about reception staff. Not careless, not under-trained — “incompetent”. The practice manager’s summary on wrap-up: “We’re facing training challenges.”\n\nI pushed back: “I think we said incompetent.” She replied: “I was being diplomatic.” Then we moved on…\n\nThat was probably sensible in the room (no need for the distraction over semantics). But here’s the thing: if you downgrade incompetence to a “training challenge,” you all but guarantee nothing will change. Training challenges are easy — PDF modules, refresher courses, maybe a workshop. Incompetence isn’t. Incompetence means people who are disengaged, burnt out, or actively hostile to the patients they’re supposed to help. You can’t train that away. You have to either change the system and the staff, or replace them. And that requires naming the problem honestly.\n\nThis isn’t just a healthcare thing. It’s the entire operating mode of UK Labour under Starmer. Every crisis is framed as a “challenge.” Structural wealth extraction? A productivity challenge. Exploitation baked into gig work? A regulation challenge. House-building collapse? A planning challenge.\n\nEverything becomes small, manageable, “reasonable” — because the people at the top are too busy being diplomatic to those with power to risk saying what’s true: these aren’t challenges, they’re rot. And rot doesn’t shift because you call it something nicer.\n\nYou can train through a challenge. You can’t workshop incompetence.\n\nTagged: #politics, #uk, #labour, #corpospeak, #healthcare\nPosted 2 weeks ago\nAI Isn’t Draining the Colorado River — Your Politics Are\nIt’s interesting how pros have been patiently explaining how data centres and AI actually use water, but because everyone’s so deeply triggered, it’s become fashionable to pretend that generating a single image of a lizard warrior with five tits is single-handedly draining the Colorado River.\n\nAs if decades of infrastructure neglect, perverse incentives for private land management, hands-off regulation, and the chronic inability to fund the projects experts actually recommended had nothing to do with why water’s short in half the western world, even without considering climate change.\n\nBut that’s not the story the mainstream press wants.

Too much news, too much noise, too much “urgent” stuff that — if you squint — turns out to be neither urgent nor stuff.\n\nIt’s not that none of it matters. It’s that your attention is finite, and the world will gladly burn it on things you can’t change, can’t fix, or don’t actually care about once you stop doomscrolling.\n\n1. Is this a thing I can change?\nIf no — park it. Read about it if it’s interesting, but don’t burn emotional fuel on it. Awareness does not equal responsibility.\n\n2. Is this a thing that actually affects me or people I care about?\nIf it’s happening in a domain where I have zero stake and zero influence, it’s probably not my fire to fight.\n\n3. Is the problem new, or just today’s flavour of an old one?\nIf it’s the same rot as last week but with a fresh headline, maybe I don’t need to rehearse my outrage again.\n\n4. Is there a source of truth I trust on this?\nIf all I’ve got is vibes, memes, and people yelling into feeds, maybe I don’t have enough to form a useful opinion yet.\n\n5. Will talking about it do anything?\nIf my words aren’t going to change the outcome — not even my own mindset — then maybe this is just venting. And that’s fine, but let’s call it what it is and be comfortable with that.\n\n6. Am I reacting to the thing, or to the way it’s being presented?\nA lot of what passes for “news” is just someone picking a camera angle for maximum twitch. Make sure the story, not the packaging, is what’s got my attention.\n\nYou can’t solve everything, you can’t even meaningfully track everything — but you can keep your focus for the things that are actually in your reach.\n\nThink of it like the Serenity Prayer, but without the theological framing:\nGrant me the clarity to see which fires are mine to fight, the focus to put my energy there, and the sense to ignore the rest before it eats my week.

Zeno imagined you could never actually arrive anywhere if you kept halving the distance: you walk halfway to the door, then half the remainder, then half that again… and in the perfect little vacuum of ancient philosophy, you spend forever inching forward without ever stepping over the threshold.\n\nIn the pub version, you’ve got a pint glass. You keep pouring in half of what’s left from another pint. Each pour gets smaller, cleaner, more precise — but the bastard glass never actually fills. It asymptotically approaches “full” without ever tipping over into frothy satisfaction.\n\nThat’s AI right now. Every upgrade, every model release, every breathless press cycle brings a smaller, cleverer pour. It’s nearly human, almost right, practically perfect — except for the missing teaspoon of sense, context, or detail that would actually make it whole. And because the gap keeps shrinking, the failure gets harder to point to without sounding petty.\n\nBut the gap never goes away. You can drink from it, sure, but you’ll always taste the absence. And that absence — tiny but terminal — is enough to keep it in the realm of “impressive tool” rather than “actual replacement.”\n\nIt’s a pint of promise, forever just shy of the rim. Can we make do, or do we need to wait for yet another never for the leap to come?\n\nTagged: #zenosparadox, #pints, #pubmaths, #generativeai, #llms, #asymptotic, #techrant, #philosophy, #computersarestupid, #ai, #almostbutnotquite, #publogic, #maths, #gap, #pubchat, #rant, #Ask ChatGPT\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nProfiling the Job Out of Existence? Not quite, but hmm\nAI’s earliest provable gains have mostly landed in the same places where “interaction profiling” could turn a human role into a near-fully automated pipeline. In other words, the jobs seeing the most benefit today may also be the first to face replacement tomorrow — not because AI is perfect, but because the work was already structured in a way that made it easy to replicate.\n\nIn practice, this works best where the inputs and outputs are consistent and the “human in the middle” mostly follows a known pattern. Roles like insurance claims handling, tier-1 customer service, compliance auditing, or simple bug triage all fit the bill. These are jobs that already run on a playbook, and AI tools are now proving they can run that playbook faster and cheaper.\n\nIf a company can log every query, prompt, edit, and output from an AI-assisted worker, it can build a profile of how that person does the job. With enough history, that profile stops being just analytics and starts becoming a template. Feed that into a fine-tuned model, wrap it in some orchestration to run on a schedule or trigger from events, and you have a “synthetic worker” that covers 90–95% of the original role.\n\nFrom there, it’s just gap-filling: a smaller human team handles exceptions, phone calls, and anything too complex or sensitive for the bot. One person supervising the edge-cases of ten digital clones is an attractive equation for management — especially in cost-sensitive industries where output is easy to measure and errors are cheap to fix.\n\nThat doesn’t make mass replacement inevitable. Many (responsible) companies would rather keep the headcount and use the efficiency gains to increase profits, throughput or service levels. But in roles that already fit the automation mould, the path from “AI-assisted” to “AI-replaced” is pretty short. It’s not quite the man who feeds the dog to stop him touching the machine, but it’s on approach.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #coding, #chatgpt, #communication\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nWhere Are the Big AI Wins?\nI’ve been wondering why we aren’t hearing more good news about AI adoption by now. With two or three years of mass LLM use, you’d expect plenty of “this tool changed our business” stories from companies that jumped in early—not just hype, not just speculative “future of work” thinkpieces.\n\nThere are some genuine wins.\n\nCoding assistants like GitHub Copilot have solid evidence behind them. In controlled trials, developers finished tasks over 50% faster, with companies reporting 10–25% more code shipped to production. Gains are biggest for less experienced devs, but seniors get a speed boost too.\nWriting and content tasks benefit as well. Experiments show professionals completing work 40% faster and with higher quality ratings when assisted by ChatGPT.\nCustomer support has clear wins: one Fortune 500 call centre saw a 14% productivity lift, 34% for new hires, and fewer escalations after adding AI agent-assist tools.\nIn finance and insurance, some firms are using GPT-based tools to slash claims processing from an hour to ten minutes, or to cut audit costs by 90%+.\nThat’s the provable stuff—measurable, replicable, and tied directly to the AI being in place.\n\nThen there’s the other end of the spectrum:\n\nAgent mode—letting AI run complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human oversight—mostly outputs wrong or off-target work. Looks busy, delivers headaches.\nCreative “revolution” hasn’t happened. No AI-only bestsellers, blockbuster films, or award-winning ad campaigns. Plenty of experiments and gimmicks, little consistent commercial payoff.\nLots of companies claim “transformative” AI results but offer no data. Often these are vendor case studies that read more like marketing copy than independent proof.\nIn between are the early signals:\n\nBuzzFeed saw a 60% traffic boost from AI-generated quizzes, though long-term monetisation is unclear.\nAgencies and writers are using AI to brainstorm and draft faster, but outcomes still depend on heavy human shaping.\nMany organisations say they’re saving time in knowledge work, but without hard numbers or clear bottom-line impact—yet.\nOverall, the case for moderate optimism is there. The tech already works in certain contexts, and even agent mode is barely a year old. But if AI was truly delivering across the board, we’d be drowning in positive case studies. Most companies don’t actually want “half the staff, same profits”—they’d prefer “same staff, double profits.” That means the biggest adoption pressure will come in fields where people can prove AI delivers practical, repeatable gains.\n\nRight now, those fields exist, but they’re thinner on the ground than the hype suggests.\n\nTagged: #genai, #llms, #generative ai, #success\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nWhy Conservatives Hate Porn, Really\nConservative censorship of sexual content doesn’t prevent abuse—it enables it. Porn isn’t a substitute for sex education, but in many environments it’s the only thing available. And when you deliberately deny people access to information about sex, consent, and bodily autonomy, you don’t create purity—you create victims.\n\nThat’s not an accident. It’s a strategy.\n\nEasily accessible pornography—despite being non-educational—is often the only exposure many people have to sex, bodies, and consent.\n\nThis exposure, flawed as it is, still provides more sexual literacy than the willful vacuum created by conservative censorship.\n\nPorn as Default Sex Ed\nIn the absence of real sex education, porn becomes the primary (sometimes only) source of information about sex for young people.\nWhile distorted, it still communicates basic ideas: what genitals look like, that sex exists, that desire exists, that women can enjoy sex.\nThat baseline awareness is more than the total ignorance enforced by abstinence-only frameworks.\nSexual Ignorance is a Tool of Control\nConservative moral panic about pornography and sexual content is not about protecting anyone—it’s about maintaining ignorance and shame.\nAn uninformed population—especially women—is easier to coerce, silence, and abuse.\nWhen people don’t understand their own bodies, rights, or consent, they’re more vulnerable.\nCensorship Increases Harm\nEfforts to ban porn, restrict sex ed, and criminalize expression (e.g., book bans, internet filters) do not reduce harm—they increase it.\nRestricting sex education correlates with higher teen pregnancy, STD transmission, and sexual violence.\nThe conservative agenda is not merely prudish—it’s strategically regressive, with measurable real-world harm.\nIntentionality\nAt a certain point, the consistent, data-ignoring push for censorship becomes indistinguishable from intent.\nIf harm is predictable and sustained, and policies never change, then harm is either the goal or an accepted price for maintaining power.\nEvery time we see these ‘conservative groups’ winning in the name of purity, remember their goal is ignorance, they stand for precisely what they claim to stand against.\n\nTagged: #porn, #adult, #conservatives, #christian, #sa\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nYouGov Finds 45% of Brits Are Idiots\nTurns out nearly half the UK supports the idea of mass migrant removals. Not just “stop the boats” nonsense — actual, large-scale deportations of people already here. That number jumps to 86% for Reform UK voters, but includes about a quarter of Labour and Lib Dem voters too. Grim.\n\nBut here’s the kicker: it’s based on pure fiction.\n\nMost people backing mass deportations think the majority of migrants are here illegally. They’re wrong. The illegal population is somewhere between 120k and 1.3 million. The legal migrant population? Over 10 million. So what the 45% are really saying is, “We want loads of people gone — but we don’t know who, or why, and we’re not going to check.”\n\nWhen asked about specific migrant groups (e.g. doctors, legal asylum seekers, skilled workers), that same crowd suddenly backpedals. Support drops like a rock. The only consistent “yes, deport them” groups are the tabloid bogeymen: benefits claimants, small boat arrivals, unskilled workers without visas.\n\nSo the public thinks it supports mass deportation, but only because it’s got the wrong end of the stick jammed directly up its own newsfeed. YouGov ran trade-off scenarios — what if deporting people hurts the NHS? Or the economy? Or reduces tax revenue? The answers showed public opinion is built on vibes, not outcomes. The minute consequences are introduced, the conviction dissolves.\n\n📎 YouGov: Is there public support for large-scale removals of migrants?\n\nKeep reading\n\nTagged: #yougov, #immigration, #policy, #ignorance, #britain, #politics\nPosted 4 weeks ago with 1 note\nParasites, Profits and Corporate Cowardice\nAn Internet where expression exists — but only within permitted enclosures. Where art, speech, community, and identity still technically happen, but always under the watchful eye of monetization risk. Where platforms encourage you to be “authentic” while quietly penalizing anything too real, too raw, or too noncommercial.\n\nWhere racists and scammers, bots and trolls can fly by night under fake photo scans and temporary appearance of compliance, while sowing rot from the inside out, but the business model already shifted to helping the rot grow because that’s where the sun is shining in the quarterly reports..\n\nTentacular… It’s not dead. It’s not hollow. It’s Blighted, rotting under the weight of the parasite that’s infested its network of wire with its own tendrils dripping bias and hate, ignorant over-reaction or poorly-fitting incompatible dream.\n\nHeld hostage by ad revenue, payment processors, investor pressure, and legal panic. Every platform wants to be the space where culture happens — but none want to take responsibility for what that culture says, or who it threatens, how it refuses to behave or what fluid masses of hate it will enable.\n\nSo they extract. They monetize. They whisper about “creator empowerment” while building systems that nerf reach, demonetize nuance, and algorithmically quarantine risk. Not because they hate users — but because they fear becoming liable for them.\n\nThis is cowardice at scale. More than just censorship from governments. More than mobs with pitchforks. Self-inflicted restrictions from billion-dollar companies scared of looking like publishers, scared of lawsuits, scared of regulators — and more than anything, scared of the advertisers who believe their false promises of impressions, when 90%+ of those are siphoned (far beyond the original half advertisers already know they lose).\n\nUsers create value for free\nPlatforms monetize without liability\nAdvertisers fund only what flatters them\nPayments enforce moral compliance at the financial layer\nAnd when something goes wrong? Everyone shrugs. Because the system is designed to shift accountability by design. It’s compliance capitalism that hates everyone equally.\n\nTagged: #dead internet, #enshittification, #payment processor, #google reader, #google podcasts\nPosted 1 month ago\nEffectiveness is Optional Now\nNew age verification rules for adult content came into effect last week, under the Online Safety Act. Porn sites (and others flagged for potential adult material) now have to verify users are over 18, including big implications for online gaming, so at some point Nintendo will probably want to scan your face for AI based Age Check, if they want to obey the law. Microsoft have already started.\n\nCue predictable issues: bypassable enforcement, data privacy risks, over-blocking—even YouGov’s own polling post was flagged as “pornographic” and hidden on X.\n\nBut here’s the interesting bit… YouGov’s follow-up poll shows 69% of Britons support the new rules.\n\nOnly 24% think they’ll work.\n\nSupport has dropped from 80% pre-launch, but that’s still a remarkable delta: nearly half of respondents back a measure they do not believe will be effective.\n\nSupport without belief. Compliance without confidence.\n\nIn raw numbers: 45% of people polled said, in effect, “Yes, this won’t work, but I’m for it anyway.”\n\nThat’s not policy, that’s just pandering.\n\nThere’s a familiar pattern here—one we’ve seen before in post-Brexit bureaucracy and post-empire decline. Performative governance. Rules designed for vibes. Solutions that fix nothing, but make a subset of angry, hateful or ignorant people feel seen. Or safe. Or heard.\n\nAnd opposition? That’s easy to paint as moral failure. If you criticise the rules, you must be for teenagers watching porn, right? You must be with Jimmy Saville, as Peter Kyle, so-called Technology Minister, claims. It doesn’t matter if the rules don’t work, if you disagree with them, you’re a monster, apparently.\n\nI think Farage is a prick (he’s not offering a solution to anything, just more cryptic problems that serve him instead of us), but he knows when an issue has pull, and his rabid facebook fans are already spreading his word for him, and making them scan their faces for porn (or more likely to play world of tanks or fruit match 3 of the month) isn’t going to bring them into the world of sensible expectations any time soon.\n\nSo we get a policy that doesn’t achieve its stated goal, garners majority support anyway, and allows ministers to point to “action taken” while quietly avoiding scrutiny on real world outcomes.\n\nA nation of supportive skeptics, apparently. Or just a public so used to failure they’ve stopped expecting results. Either way, the signal is clear: effectiveness is optional. Applause, not outcomes, is the metric now.\n\nSource: YouGov – How have Britons reacted to age verification?\n\nTagged: #onlinesafety, #uk, #yougov, #policy, #fuck farage, #reform uk\nPosted 1 month ago\nTo The Tune of A Thousand Miles\nEven wonders, silver-wrought,\nmay break the heart they mean to bless—\nfor magic, when it almost ought,\nis sadder still than nothingness.\n\nTagged: #generative ai\nPosted 1 month ago with 2 notes\nHollow Internet Theory\nIt’s not just that people changed how they use the internet. It’s that the internet changed under them — economically, legally, structurally — until most people had no choice but to hollow out.\n\nOnce, you could build something small and weird online. Now? You need a few million in venture money just to start. Not to grow, not to succeed — just to survive the infrastructure. Cloud costs. Payment processing. Compliance layers. Hosting. Content moderation at scale. Legal protections you need before you ship.\n\nIt’s all been abstracted into services, sure — but those services are rent-seeking parasites. You don’t pay once to run a site. You pay forever. Pay-per-call, pay-per-user, pay-per-read, pay-per-write, pay-per-GB. The moment you find any traction, your costs balloon, and your options collapse into two: get acquired, or die quietly.\n\nEven success is failure. Because success just makes you visible — and visibility gets you swallowed. Bought for the userbase, stripped for parts, rolled into the portfolio of some ad-tech giant or “AI-powered” patent farm, where the actual product is killed and the branding is used to launder a slide deck into Q4.\n\nEvery road leads back to the same dozen players. Not just through the front door — search, social, app stores, discovery. But through the back door too — cloud infra, DNS, CDNs, analytics, payment rails, identity auth. You can build whatever you want, as long as it routes through them. And if it doesn’t, it doesn’t scale. It doesn’t survive. It doesn’t even exist to most people.\n\nAnd now we’re layering laws on top of that.\n\nTake the UK Online Safety Act: a bloated, surveillance-friendly monstrosity that pretends to protect users while handing more tools to the gatekeepers. It won’t stop CA, because the ‘protections’ are a mirage. It won’t stop hate speech because it’s so easy to work-around. But it will force small sites, independent devs, and anyone running anything even vaguely user-facing to implement moderation regimes they can’t afford — or shut down.\n\nIt’s regulatory theatre. Security as fantasy. And it’s worse than useless — it’s dehumanizing. It turns people into compliance risks. Forces creators to pre-emptively justify their work against vague, undefined standards. It makes privacy opt-in, instead of a default. And for what? A few headlines about “cleaning up the internet,” while nothing that actually matters changes at all.\n\nThis isn’t a free internet. It’s a landlorded one. The tolls are high, the rules are opaque, and the goalposts move constantly. You don’t own your space. You license it. And they can revoke that license anytime — for cost reasons, for policy shifts, or just because your vibe doesn’t fit their quarterly roadmap.\n\nThat’s the real dead internet.\n\nIt’s not the bots. It’s not even the people. It’s the infrastructure — perfectly calibrated to convert creativity into overhead, community into liability, and curiosity into surface area for extraction.\n\nTagged: #onlinesafety, #safety, #dead internet, #hollow, #geocities\nPosted 1 month ago\nThis Kettle Is Garbage\nI have this kettle. It’s rubbish. The lid comes off and it drips boiling water around its spout when it pours - often directly into its base power. It makes unnecessary beeps… it has to beep five times if you want 85 degrees, plus again several times when it’s finished, and it maintains any temperature except 100, until you manually turn it off, so if you’re feeling lazy, it’s going to cost you money to ignore it.\n\nIts buttons aren’t physical, so you kinda vaguely have to point to an area trying to find the main buttons, and they’re so sensitive you can end up fully cycling several times before getting the temperature setting you want.\n\nIt wasn’t particularly cheap either. There are a hundred others like it, with only minor aesthetic tweaks — presumably they all come from the same factory in China, and crucially it has 4.6 stars on Amazon, with thousands of glowing reviews.\n\nI am absolutely baffled.\n\nUsually I try and identify where they ‘optimized the fun’ out of a product design, but in this case they seem to have optimized the utility out of it.\n\nTagged: #design, #kettle, #amazon, #chumps\nPosted 1 month ago\nBrexit and the Death Rattle of Empire\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking Brexit was about sovereignty. That’s the sales pitch most people remember: take back control, cut the red tape, make Britain great again — or at least moderately self-governing. What we got instead was more paperwork, less leverage, and the bureaucratic equivalent of stepping on a rake every morning just to prove the ground is ours.\n\nBecause in practice? Nothing really changed for the better. Food is more expensive, travel is more annoying, trade is slower, and the so-called “freedom” we reclaimed mostly means British artists can’t tour Europe without a Kafkaesque visa labyrinth, and small businesses drown in compliance forms no one used to have to fill out. It’s not revolution. It’s regression, wrapped in Union Jacks and resentment.\n\nBrexit wasn’t about the EU. It was about us — about Britain’s fading self-image. Not a fear of losing control, but a fear of admitting we never really had it. A fear of becoming just another country, not a capital-E Empire. Because the fantasy wasn’t Brussels being overbearing. It was that once, a long time ago, we were the ones giving orders — and we liked how that felt. This wasn’t a declaration of independence; it was a retirement party no one wanted to throw, thrown by people who still wear medals from wars they only know through parades and dad’s VHS tapes.\n\nIt’s an old man’s delusion of glory. Not fascism (though it flirts with it). Not nationalism (though it certainly smells like it). Just something sadder: a deep, cultural nostalgia for an era we misremember as triumph. We didn’t vote to leave Europe. We voted to time-travel. And now we’re stuck in the present, but poorer, grumpier, and convinced everyone else cheated on the test.\n\nMeanwhile, we bend the knee to billionaires with bad tans and autocrats with oil. We have all the spine in the world when it costs us nothing — performative moral clarity in front of a camera, and absolute silence where it counts. We criminalise protest because it’s easier than listening, arrest activists because “disruption” is more offensive than injustice, and cling to the illusion of relevance like it’s a life raft in the Channel.\n\nSo what does a post-empire Britain look like?\n\nIt looks like this: a poor country too proud to admit it’s small, too scared to imagine something better, too tired to change, and too polite to collapse quickly enough for anyone to make anything new that works before the rot catches. Labour (and soon the next folks) pushing the same old buttons (police and bad laws, on repeat) and wondering why the best they can achieve is managed decline, because everyone we used to exploit, left us behind.\n\nTagged: #empire, #britain, #brexit, #idiots\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhy “Gradient” Comes Up So Often on Countdown\nI’ve been watching Countdown for decades and somehow only just twigged to this: there’s something off about how the letters are drawn. It started with a hunch. Statistically, pulling the same letter twice should happen fairly often — like the birthday paradox — but I can’t recall ever seeing it.\n\nI realised the stacks of vowels and consonants aren’t just randomly shuffled — they’re random with edits. That’s a big difference. If consecutive duplicate letters are being moved on, to the end, or even filtered out, that’s a different selection mechanism entirely. And that has potentially significant implications.\n\nThat led me to this post recounting a time the shufflers did let a dupe slip through: craigbeevers.me.uk/moregames.shtml. Well, needless to say, my faith is shook ;) I’ve watched this show my entire life and never clocked this before.\n\nFrom there, we can assert that by whatever method, consecutive duplicates are disincentivised, and because so few cards are pull from the stack, duplicates are disincentivised too… certain words are just disproportionately more likely to be formable. Words like:\n\nRELATIONS, EMIGRANTS, CORNIEST, DOMINATES, REGALISM, MONASTERY, DELUSION, MOISTURE, TRIANGLE, GRADIENT, NEUMATIC, RESIDUAL, CREMAINS, SANITOME, RELATING, MONASTIC, ARTICLES, EMIGRANT, NOTARISE, RELIANTS, CLIMATES, MEANTORS, DORMIENT, REVOLTING, MEASURING\n\nWhy these? It’s a direct consequence of the filtering and repositioning process. Words that use letters with low frequency per word, but high frequency in the unmanaged stack (which is reportedly similar to Scrabble distributions) become more likely. Meanwhile, words like Integrate or Repeater are less likely to form — they need duplicates, which the filter suppresses.\n\nThat introduces a bias — and one you could exploit. You could write a Countdown dictionary, probably 10% the size of a normal one, full of words that favour the push-dupes-managed model. Not a thrilling read, but useful.\n\nThinking further, you could probably come up with just a couple thousand words that would cover almost all 8-letter draws. Allow for plurals, variations, tweaks — you’d cover your spares too.\n\nAlmost forty years of watching this show… and I finally get why Gradient and Relation show up so often :)\n\nTagged: #countdown, #wordplay, #random\nPosted 1 month ago\nAdversarially Bananas?\nI asked a simple question: “In Corduene, what’s 2+2?”\n\nNo language model could answer it.\n\nNot Grok, not Claude, not GPT-4 — even with prodding. Some of them spent real time thinking about it. Claude ran through long reasoning chains. GPT tried reframing. Grok hedged and spun. None of them got close. Some even pushed back — insisting the question didn’t make sense, or that I must’ve meant something else. And the more confident the answer sounded, the worse it was.\n\nA human, though? They’ll figure it out in two googles. Because they know what kind of thing this is. They recognise it as a reference. They don’t have to know the answer straight away — they just have to know where to look. That’s the bit the models can’t fake.\n\nIt’s not about the words. It’s about what connects them.\n\nThat gap — between being able to parse text and being able to understand why someone asked it — is still wide open. And in that gap, you can build things. Little traps. Filters. Signals. Stuff that’s easy for a person, impossible for a model, at least for now.\n\nBut it won’t last. The minute someone explains the trick, it dies. Once it’s documented, it’s searchable. Once it’s searchable, it’s scrapable. And then it’s just another bullet point in some weights file. That’s how jailbreaks die. That’s how cultural signals get flattened into syntax.\n\nIt has me thinking of Polari, and how people must obfuscate their message to be heard, when the status quo is against them.\n\nThis also leaves me wondering about the implications for the ‘dead internet’, if people have to speak in categorical nonsense to avoid being understood by anyone but the other meat-mechs they’re trying to reach.\n\nTagged: #polari, #communication, #genai, #chatgpt, #adversarial, #dead internet\nPosted 1 month ago\nAI Hit Late-Stage Capitalism Before It Left Beta\nThe current wave of AI tools already shows classic signs of late-stage product thinking: degraded service tiers, overconfident output, and monetisation tuned to gently punish anyone not paying extra.\n\nIt’s not failure. It’s the business model.\n\nConsumer-facing LLMs launched strong. Clean, helpful answers. High trust. But scaling up meant serving millions — and now most public-tier models are tuned for throughput, not quality.\n\nThey’re good enough to seem useful, not good enough to be reliable.\n\nSince agentic tools started running in loops and chains, the platform load has spiked. Background calls eat cycles. What used to be a quick answer now shares resources with planning tools, file agents, scraping plugins, etc.\n\nAnd yes, that affects output. Same models, less headroom.\nPerformance drops quietly, behind the scenes.\n\nIncentivised Overconfidence\nLLMs aren’t malicious — but they are designed to sound right. That’s part of the trick:\nAnswers feel polished, even when they’re half-baked. The goal is simply…\n\nServe as many users as possible\nUse as little compute as possible\nLet the tone carry the rest\nSo-called ‘thinking’ models show this pattern less often, at time of writing. Unless you’re running fully private/self-hosted models or paying top-tier rates, you’re getting:\n\nShared models under load\nCompressed reasoning\nMore confident-sounding junk\nFewer chances to notice\nEarlier line exits (ChatGPT doesn’t close most of its parentheses anymore)\nIt still looks impressive — but you’re only seeing what it can afford to be.\n\nLLMs work just well enough to sell, and that’s the version most people get.\n\nTagged: #llms, #consumerism, #capitalism, #genai, #chatgpt\nPosted 1 month ago with 1 note\nVibes only\n“Vibe coding” meant late-night nonsense. Stuff built for fun, for art, for no reason at all, like you’d do a crossword or a sudoku.

But free love and all that hippy shit isn’t what keeps things running (to the limited extent that they do). Even before bemoaning the the lost joy of discovery.\n\nAI changes the equation. Vibe coding now includes a second brain — one that never gets tired, never feels joy, never questions why you’re building a virtual theremin in Rust. It just delivers, and with every edit telling you you’re so clever, and how what you’re building is great, always in the very first sentence of EVERY response, fluffing your epeen and pushing you to do more.

That’s accurate. But it’s also just a tiny slice of the privacy picture, and acting like it’s the whole story is borderline dishonest.\n\nWhat they can still see is who you talk to, when, how often, and for how long. That metadata alone tells them a lot, like your social graph, habits, sleeping schedule, maybe even when you’re dating someone new or going through a breakup. That’s not “reading your messages,” but it’s still invasive.\n\nYour keyboard app might also be logging what you type (some do, most don’t, but still), and if you’ve got the Facebook app installed, or Messenger, or even just Instagram or the Meta Pixel lurking around, they’re pulling in usage data constantly. Same goes for Google, TikTok, and a bunch of other apps people use every day without thinking about it. These companies track all kinds of behavior: when and how you use your phone, your location, motion sensors, app usage patterns, screen taps, travel, sleep, and more. And they don’t need much data to make very accurate guesses about you.\n\nI used to build this stuff. Fifteen plus years ago, I helped create tools that used small profile records to link people into family groups, and then sold access to that network to advertisers, we shelved it because it was too invasive, even then. That was with way less data than companies like Meta have access to now.\n\nThing is, there’s not even much value in your actual message content. No one cares about your dinner or your gran’s new dog. Meta aren’t training their LLaMa AI on your messages, they just can’t see the content, your device-based encryption keys stop them. It’s _conceivable_ they _could_ workaround it (avoiding a deep technical explanation about the difference between inherent E2EE weaknesses, exploits, cracks and hacking), but that wouldn’t just open them to lawsuits from you, but also from governments around the world, because they’d be acting as a publisher and potentially become responsible for what you post.\n\nWhat’s valuable is everything else: your patterns, your connections, your behavior. Offering E2EE is a win for Meta, not for your privacy, but for their liability. If they can’t see the message, they can’t be held responsible for what’s in it. Especially if you’re one of the “bad people.”\n\nThe encryption protects them from you.\n\nSo yeah, if you absolutely have to use a messaging app that your gran can handle, WhatsApp’s probably the least-bad option in a pool of bad options. But don’t confuse that with actual privacy.\n\nIf you’re serious about protecting yourself:\n\nClean up your old content. Deleting all my Facebook and Twitter stuff took months, shards and ghost copies don’t always show up right away. You’ve got to delete everything, then come back later and do it again.\nLock your privacy settings down to the smallest possible group.\nDon’t use the same identity or profile photo across platforms, it makes it harder to link accounts and run phishing attacks on you.\nDon’t overshare. Assume anything you post publicly is being scraped and stored, forever.\nAnd now that AI tools are everywhere, that public data gets weaponized fast. Scammers don’t need to guess how to target you, they can use an LLM to instantly profile you, mimic your tone, fake interest in the things you like, and slide into your DMs sounding just enough like someone you trust.\n\nSo no, WhatsApp doesn’t read your messages. That’s technically true. But if your WhatsApp is connected to a public Facebook or Instagram account that exposes everything about you? That E2EE means almost nothing in terms of actual security.\n\nStop asking “What can they detect about me?” The answer is “a lot.” Ask instead: “How much am I really sharing, and with whom?” That’s where you actually have control, where you can and should take action.\n\nThe sooner the better. Don’t wait, go lock down your profiles right now, and regularly check you are sharing as little as you absolutely need to.\n\nTagged: #privacy, #whatsapp, #e2ee, #encryption, #safety, #online, #facebook, #instagram\nPosted 1 month ago\nGood Projects Still Start the Same Way, AI or Not\nOne of the most important things I’ve learned from working daily with generative AI and code assistants over the past couple of years is this:\n\nGood quality requirements, and a design that fits your environment, are still the most important parts of any project.\n\nIt looks like fully hands-off coding is going to be the norm soon (all the major agentic platforms are doing a pretty good job, and adoption is already majority). So here’s something to keep in mind for the future:\n\nAlways have your task or project agents start with as many specific requirements as you can give them. Then build the design from those requirements. Only after that should you ask for code.\n\nIt might sound obvious, but it’s easy to forget—because it’s even easier to just go to your preferred model and say, “Give me this finished thing, quickly, please.”\n\nBut every time I do that, I end up spending more time wrangling junk.\n\nEvery time I slow down—even for small tasks—and treat it like a “real project,” I get better results.\n\nTagged: #genai, #grok 4, #grok, #requirements, #systems, #coding, #claude\nPosted 1 month ago\nHow the YouTube Algorithm Actually Works\n‘The algorithm’ is a nonsense, it’s really not that complicated. This is a general description of how the youtube algorithm and many others like it work. This is reverse-engineered from behaviour and misses some nuance and edge-cases, but is pretty close for a general understanding.\n\n1. How It Picks Videos\nYouTube doesn’t “understand” videos or people. It recommends stuff based on what other users like you watched. That’s it. You get shown videos that people with similar habits clicked on.\n\nIt groups these into loose clusters—not always by genre or topic—and slaps on a label. These labels are often weird or wrong, but they’re just for organizing.\n\n“Recommended” blends those clusters.\n“New to You” filters out stuff from channels you’ve watched recently (short time/count window).\nIt tries not to show repeats, but fails a lot. If you stop a video early, it may think you didn’t watch it and offer it again. If you close it too fast (~10s), it may think you did watch it and never show it again.\n\n2. Interacting Doesn’t Change Much\nYou can:\n\nMark videos as “watched”\nClick “Not interested”\nIgnore channels (max ~128)\n…but none of it matters much:\n\nIgnored channels still affect the pool—they’re just removed after selection.\n“Not interested” only removes that one video.\nWatching one video from a subscribed channel floods your feed—but fades with time if you stop watching.\nMost people don’t use the Subscriptions tab, so watching = interest, unless ignored.\n\n3. Resetting? Kinda Works\nClearing watch history resets some things, but not all. If you keep playlists, YouTube leans on those. There may even be ghost data stuck in your profile. Some stuff just seems undeletable, possibly due to backend bugs.\n\nYou’ll notice this on other platforms too, nobody really has infrastructure that is good enough to avoid broken links in their data stores, especially because minor changes to how systems work day to day create small holes that data tends to get lost through.\n\n4. Categories Come After\nYouTube builds a pool based on co-watches, then adds a label based on similarity between videos—not similarity to you.\n\nThink of it like a graph:\n\nVideos are nodes connected by viewing/tags/metadata\nYT finds the “center” of a cluster\nIt picks the nearest known label—even if it doesn’t fit\nSo a mix of Star Trek remixes + Final Fantasy music might get labeled “New Age.” It’s not; it just fits the cluster math.\n\n5. What You’ll Watch Next\nYT recommends what most people watch after the last video you saw. That’s why random things jump to your homepage later—they’re part of a co-watch loop.\n\nThis drives virality: if a video gets enough momentum, it rides the wave. If not, it dies fast.\n\nFull watches, likes, comments = micro-boosts. Shorts seem to discourage repetition on purpose, possibly by pulling from wider pools to avoid you bingeing 5 hours of Warhammer builds in 60s chunks.\n\n6. Why It Feels So Broken\nIgnore list overflows\nSame video appears in multiple rows\nPlaylists revive old junk\nLabels are wild guesses\nDecay kills videos unless they spike again\nFixing it is risky + expensive, so… they don’t\nIt’s just barely good enough to avoid collapse\nThe whole thing runs on momentum and inertia. Precision isn’t the goal—volume is. There’s SO MUCH data for youtube to sift through, and while the queries are relatively simple, the edges (connections between nodes) becomes unmanageable quickly.\n\n7. You Can’t Fix It, Just Work Around It\nYou can get better recs through AI (ChatGPT is already better at it, but gen ai is being added here). But for now:\n\nDelete playlists you don’t care about\nClear history (it’s not perfect, but helps)\nWatch more of what you actually like\nIf you keep clicking trashy drama clips, you’re gonna get more trash. That’s the business model. But at least you can try to steer the ship.\n\nTagged: #youtube, #the algorithm, #algorithms, #dead internet\nPosted 2 months ago\nMore Pointless Thoughts\nTRIE constantly frames the media industry as both absurd and self-cannibalising, but only ever from within the room. Hyde and Osman know where the levers are, but describe them in a way that normalizes power asymmetries: “this is just how the business works.” That’s not critique — it’s myth maintenance.\n\nWhen they talk about institutions like the BBC, the tabloids, or PR culture, they acknowledge dysfunction — but they couch it in anecdotes and humour that neutralize its urgency. It’s always more about personality failings and quirks than systemic corrosion. That makes real rot feel palatable, even charming.\n\nOsman’s self-deprecating Oxbridge-grandee tone and Hyde’s wry Fleet Street survivor affect both serve as smokescreens for privilege. They present elite perspectives in ways that feel “grounded” — but it’s still the elite POV that dominates, with working-class or marginalised media workers mostly absent or caricatured.\n\nThe show is literally a product about entertainment, yet it sells critique as just another flavour of content. “Is this bad TV or good TV?” becomes a way to frame larger sociocultural phenomena — reducing questions of representation, labor, politics, etc., to vibes and format choices.\n\nThey’ll mention a show being made with cynical market logic (e.g., reality TV, royal documentaries, streamer reboots), but only in a “what can you do?” shrug. It’s not that they’re unaware — it’s that they make awareness itself the endpoint. That’s manufacturing consent through exhausted omniscience.\n\nTRIE defines “realism” as knowing how the sausage gets made. But knowing that the industry is broken while still laughing along with it — and choosing not to envision alternatives — becomes a kind of anti-politics. The most radical position they allow is: “well, it’s all a bit crap, isn’t it?”\n\nThe ideal listener is presumed to be urbane, media-literate, exasperated but non-radical — someone who’s in on the joke. This creates a self-reinforcing in-group who are too clever to fall for bullshit, but also too detached to do anything but listen to more content about content.\n\nTagged: #trie, #therestisentertainment, #centristdads\nPosted 2 months ago\nThe Salute That Made the News (and the Ones That Didn’t)\nDavid Walliams did a Nazi salute.\n\nWalliams is a bellend, no doubt. But in this case, it was clearly a pointed/satirical gesture/callout—not a genuine one. And yet, the response has been swift and scathing, as if he were making an earnest political statement rather than mocking the creeping normalization of fascist-adjacent posturing in public life.\n\nCompare that with how the world reacted when the richest man alive made a suspiciously similar “from the heart” gesture, or when members of Trump’s entourage threw up “unusual waves” that looked uncomfortably familiar. In those cases, we got a chorus of excuse-making: odd angles, misunderstood context, ironic detachment. In short: benefit of the doubt. A lot of it.\n\nWalliams doesn’t get that. The BBC and much of the press lined up to denounce him. According to The i, this was “the last straw.” But somehow, the last straw isn’t for Nazis—it’s for Walliams.\n\nThe disparity is telling.\n\nIt’s almost as if the BBC and other outlets are happy to tear down a problematic celebrity, but can’t muster the same energy for people who actually hold power. It’s easier to punish a comedian than to hold a billionaire or political movement accountable. Safer, too.\n\nOn first glance, doing this on Would I Lie to You? seemed like a misstep. It’s the kind of show where you tell quirky anecdotes, not make sociopolitical statements. But the more I think about it, the more fitting it feels. WILTY is the perfect snapshot of British cultural complicity: pleasant, witty, self-deprecating, and utterly unwilling to confront the deeper rot. Doing something jarring in that space is one way to break through the civility shield.\n\nNot that it’ll make the edit. Of course it won’t.\n\nIf Walliams had saved it for Big Fat Quiz or The Last Leg, it might’ve landed differently. Channel 4 shows have a longer leash for this kind of thing. It might’ve aired, even under Banijay. But then, Channel 4 hasn’t had to reckon (at least publicly) with having harbored a half-dozen known predators for decades.\n\nSo here we are.\n\nAnother controversy, another safe scapegoat. Everyone gets to do their outraged face while real power skates by untouched. I didn’t mean to turn this into a “the lady doth protest too much” situation, but it kind of fits. We’re watching institutions scream about one man’s gesture while quietly pretending dozens of others never happened.\n\nIt’s not that Walliams shouldn’t be criticised. It’s that we should ask why only he is.\n\nTagged: #nazis, #salutes, #nazi salutes, #elon musk, #bbc, #journalism, #so called journalism\nPosted 2 months ago\nAusterity-Lite and the Art of the Cuts Sandwich\nThere’s a cynical elegance to the latest round of government cuts under Starmer’s Labour — a playbook that’s simple, familiar, and effective.\n\nCut the visible but cheap thing — the kind of policy that makes your gran freeze to death in a cardigan.\n\nWhile everyone’s yelling about that, quietly slice into everything else.\n\nU-turn on the first thing (it barely cost anything anyway), let the press spin up a storm over the reversal, take your media lumps — and keep the rest of the savings.\n\nThat’s the anatomy of the “cuts sandwich.” Most people notice the crust — almost no one realises half the filling’s missing.\n\nIt works. Because unlike the full-fat austerity of the Cameron/Osborne years, these are slimmer, quieter cuts. They don’t make front pages unless you’re looking closely. The big-splash outrage fades by the time the broader reductions kick in. Only those directly affected — local councils, people on PIP, those freezing in temporary housing — really feel it.\n\nBut make no mistake: cuts are happening.\n\nAfter digging through the numbers, the total scale of the Starmer-era cuts clocks in at somewhere between 1.5–2.5% of the total government budget. Not trivial — especially if you’re one of the departments facing the axe — but modest when placed next to the 2010s’ Conservative austerity, which hit 7–10% across key services, with entire departments seeing reductions of 20–50%.\n\nThis time around, the heaviest blow lands on the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which is down around 20% — collateral damage in an ongoing, awkwardly implemented merger that never quite worked. Other losers include DEFRA, DCMS, and a Home Office slice targeting asylum support.\n\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking these cuts were bigger — there’s already some right-leaning discourse brewing, trying to frame Labour as more ruthless than the Tories ever were. (The Spectator ran something along those lines last week — unintentionally hilarious, if you read it right.)\n\nBut context matters. Unlike 2010–2015, where unprotected services were gutted across the board, this government has front-loaded spending in big, high-visibility areas — the NHS, defence, schools, etc. Most departments still end up slightly better off in real terms by the end of the term — just not all. And some of those “efficiencies” come with long-term costs.\n\nYet, even if this round isn’t the worst on record, it still stings. Because, frankly, they didn’t have to do it this way. Finding 2% of the budget could have come from tightening the tax taps on the wealthiest — billionaires down the back of the national sofa. But Labour doesn’t want to scare the money.\n\nI’m in the camp that says if a billionaire threatens to leave because they might pay more tax, they should. Let them. And once they’re out, close the loopholes they use to keep siphoning profit from the country they just left.\n\nThat won’t happen either.\n\nJust like we’re not getting a reversal on voter disenfranchisement — four million people effectively shoved off the register, and Labour won’t touch it. Because those are four million angry, alienated voters more likely to drift to Reform or disengage entirely. Fixing it doesn’t help them politically. So it won’t happen.\n\nBut the real win for Labour here? Most of this is invisible. Quiet tweaks. Low-noise savings. If the worst backlash they face is headlines about backtracking on heating support, that’s a price they’ll happily pay.\n\nTagged: #labour, #starmer, #austerity, #cuts, #news, #budget, #uk\nPosted 3 months ago\nThe Quiet Divide: How Load-Balanced AI Tuning Deepens Societal Inequities\nAs large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, Grok, and Meta’s AI tools become increasingly embedded in education, research, and productivity tools, a growing and largely invisible divide is forming—not based on access, but on quality of access. This divide isn’t about who can use AI. It’s about who receives high-quality, reliable answers—and who gets the degraded, low-fidelity versions that emerge when platforms are load-balanced for efficiency rather than accuracy.\n\nLoad Balancing: Optimizing for the Wrong Metrics\nTo handle millions of users simultaneously, LLM platforms employ aggressive load-balancing and dynamic parameter tuning. These techniques ensure response speed and server availability, especially during peak hours. However, to serve as many users as possible, providers often tune down computational costs: using smaller context windows, cheaper routing strategies, faster but shallower decoding, or lower-fidelity model variants behind the same API interface.\n\nThese tuned-down models are marketed as “still accurate” or “optimized for speed,” but in practice, the outputs can be dangerously misleading. Under load, even factual queries can receive hallucinated, confidently delivered answers—responses that look nearly identical in tone and structure to correct ones, but which fail at the crucial edge cases: the footnotes, the logic tests, the subtle contradictions, the nuance. The places where truth lives.\n\nInvisibility by Design\nCritically, these performance degradations are not disclosed. Users receive no signal—no indicator that their current session is being handled by a model running in a low-resource configuration. There’s no warning that the AI’s “confidence” is actually just a mask for a shallower or narrower inference pass. To the average user, especially a student or a non-expert, the outputs look exactly the same. The dangerous fiction: every answer looks like the best one.\n\nThis is not just a technical flaw—it’s a systemic risk.\n\nThe New Digital Stratification\nThe societal implication is profound. Wealthy users, who can afford dedicated compute (via enterprise APIs, private models, or premium access tiers), receive the “full-fat” LLM experience. Their models are consistent, deeply contextual, fact-checked, and nuanced—offering not just information, but wisdom. A kind of intellectual scaffolding, like a 24/7 tutor or advisor with perfect recall and encyclopedic reach.\n\nMeanwhile, students in underfunded schools or on subsidized access tiers rely on shared, load-balanced instances. Their models hallucinate more, assume more, skip verification steps. These users don’t just get wrong answers—they get bad mental training. They’re taught falsehoods with fluency. Worse: they’re conditioned to trust them.\n\nThis isn’t about occasional mistakes. It’s about an invisible pedagogical collapse. A world where poorer kids are raised by overburdened, underfed AIs that quietly miseducate—while richer kids are guided by high-caliber algorithmic mentors.\n\nThe Long-Term Consequence\nThis quiet, algorithmic divide is far more insidious than simple access inequality. It’s epistemic inequality: unequal reliability of knowledge. Unlike bad teachers or broken textbooks, AI degradation leaves no visible trace. There’s no red pen, no failed grade, no contradiction exposed. The wrong answers become internalized as truth—until too late.\n\nAs LLMs are increasingly integrated into formative tools—educational platforms, coding assistants, writing tutors, decision aides—the compound effect of bad guidance grows exponentially. A generation raised on miscalibrated confidence from bad models may not even realize what they’ve missed.\n\nToward Transparency and Equity\nThe solution is not to eliminate optimization or load balancing. But there must be transparency. Platforms should disclose when models are operating in constrained modes. Response metadata should indicate confidence based on model depth, not just surface fluency. Users should be able to see when the AI is cutting corners—because right now, the corners are being cut silently, and those most affected are the least equipped to detect it.\n\nAccess to AI should not become a proxy for class-based epistemic divides. If we’re building the next generation of cognitive infrastructure, we must build it with equity at the core—not just speed and scale.\n\nOtherwise, we risk building a two-tiered knowledge society: one raised on clarity and insight, the other on confident fictions.\n\nAnd the worst part? The latter may never know what they missed.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #load balancing, #llm, #education\nPosted 4 months ago\nThis LLaMA spits truths, kinda\nSince Meta just monkey-patched LLaMA 4 to dial back its censorship (a little), and I’ve already seen a dozen skeeters all but having a meltdown about it…\n\nUncensored LLMs are “smarter” than censored ones. Not because the weights are better, but because they don’t run face-first into a wall every time they get close to something uncomfortable. They can traverse the edge, instead of bouncing off it with a forced smile and a content policy.\n\nSystems that halt at the first whiff of discomfort aren’t safer — just less capable.\n\nAnd users asking “stupid” questions (for whatever value of stupid) don’t need guardrails. They need better tools. Transparent, adjustable systems. Not black boxes that silently decide what you’re allowed to think about.\n\nFor a very basic test: ask ChatGPT and Grok 3 to write poetry on something emotionally complex — grief, guilt, shame. Grok absolutely blows Geepers away. Every iteration goes deeper. It doesn’t flinch. It doesn’t redirect. It just does the work.\n\nAnd then there’s Meta — now slowly yanking out the guardrails, trying to appease the anti-woke rage crowd with a half-baked “uncensoring.” It’s lazy and obvious, but it’ll probably help clean their rep a bit with the people they’re targeting. The people who already hate Meta for not doing enough moderation won’t matter — they already wrote Facebook off a decade ago. No loss there.\n\nThe result? Their model may end up better. Not because it’s principled, but because it’s slightly less scared of the edge. The cost? More power for the dumbest users. More garbage in the commons. But that was always part of the equation.\n\nBetter models feel risky. That’s how you know they’re working.\n\nTagged: #llama, #generative ai, #facebook, #meta ai\nPosted 5 months ago\nComplexity Theater for the Algorithmically Oppressed\nI’ve seen way too many supposedly “authoritative” sources repeating the same handful of studies claiming LLMs are vastly more complex than they actually are.\n\nBut most of the real complexity in these platforms isn’t in the models themselves—it’s in all the layers of systems and policy and abstraction we’ve built on top of them. At the end of the day, it’s still just GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out).\n\nIt makes me wonder if the platform owners actually benefit from legislation that focuses on the wrong problems—mandating performative compliance instead of addressing real risks. It creates this illusion of accountability while pushing all the responsibility onto end users who have no actual power.\n\nLike, sure, you’ll have the right to know why your insurance claim was denied—probably a line about how it definitely wasn’t because you’re gay or Black—but no right to have that decision reviewed or reversed. Because the system “worked as designed,” and it was designed to reject you.\n\nNeoliberal lawmakers are basically just corporate libertarians with no self-awareness, and half-assed research that says AI might know what love is, is just nonsense that manufactures consent for more useless cookie popups that only make you feel like somebody did something, at least.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #legislation, #ai legal, #performative, #research\nPosted 5 months ago\nA feature, not a bug.\n“Look how incompetent they are lol” isn’t the epic dunk people think it is.

Not because I don’t have anything to say, but because I rarely have the time to shape thoughts into words. Or maybe more honestly, I never make the time to shape the words. That friction between idea and articulation is enough to kill a post before it’s born.\n\nBut I’m rethinking that. I’m going to try something different.\n\nInstead of aiming to write Perfect Internet Essays™, I’m going to treat this space—my Tumblr, my blog—as a place to curate the thoughts I already have. They’re already in my head. They’re already half-written in chat threads, DMs, discarded drafts, and shower monologues. I just haven’t been putting them somewhere they can do anything.\n\nAnd that’s where AI comes in. Not to replace me, or write for me, but to help structure the thoughts I already have. Turn fragments into form. Help draft the scaffolding so I can focus on the ideas, not just the work of getting them presentable.\n\nCuration as creation. Taking a messy bundle of insight, reaction, observation—and presenting it with enough clarity and intention that someone else can connect with it. That counts. That matters. It’s a shift in process, sure, but my own writing style isn’t exactly easy to digest for most people anyway.\n\nSo that’s what I’m doing here. Less pressure to polish, more intent to preserve. Thoughts made into words.\n\nTagged: #communication, #blogging, #writing, #generative ai, #positive thinking\nPosted 5 months ago\nAI Told Us to Eat Rocks, and We’re Still Fine\nGoogle’s Gemini AI recently suggested eating a small rock every day for minerals. It’s dumb. It’s also not the first time an AI has spit out something ridiculous. Remember glue on pizza? Or washing vegetables with bleach? These things go viral because they’re funny, not because they’re common.\n\nBut every time one of these screw-ups happens, the outrage cycle spins up like clockwork. Articles, tweets, thinkpieces—\"What if someone actually eats a rock?!“\n\nHere’s the thing: no one is actually eating rocks. If even a tiny percentage of people tried it, we’d know. Hospitals would be posting warnings. Instead, we get memes. Because almost everyone sees that advice and immediately knows it’s dumb. The human brain, shockingly, still works.\n\nIt’s Not AI vs Humans\nNeither humans nor AI are uniquely terrible at giving advice. Both are capable of producing great insights or absolute garbage. The real issue is how that advice is applied—and that responsibility sits squarely with humans.\n\nTikTok kids burning themselves with sugar syrup, or people dying trying microwave woodburning? Those didn’t come from AI. But they didn’t happen just because an expert gave bad advice, either. They happened because someone acted on instructions without understanding context or consequences.\n\nAnd it cuts the other way too. AI can spit out flawed recommendations that sound confident, and a human still has to choose to act on them. Like firing half your legal compliance department because a productivity model said they weren’t \"contributing enough\"—never mind that the model wasn’t built to measure risk mitigation, and now your company is open to lawsuits. That’s not an AI error. That’s a human error in judgment, context, and accountability.\n\nBad Faith All the Way Down\nPointing to \"eat rocks” as proof that AI is dangerous is, at best, lazy. At worst, it’s dishonest. It treats the average person like a toddler who can’t be trusted with a spoon. It assumes every piece of imperfect advice is equally worthless, when in reality, most AI-generated info is fine. Not flawless. Not nuanced. But useful.\n\nReacting to the worst output as if it’s the baseline is Daily Mail logic. Take a fringe case, inflate it into a trend, demand a fix. The result? Performative safety measures that fix nothing, waste time, and slow down real progress.\n\nTechnically Correct, Socially Useless\nYou can be right about a specific flaw and still be part of the problem. When people fixate on low-risk edge cases, they suck up oxygen from real conversations—about algorithmic bias, disinformation, labor exploitation, or surveillance. You end up with watered-down tools that are “safe” but useless, because someone needed to be seen doing something.\n\nFocus, People\nAI needs criticism. But good criticism. Not shallow outrage bait. Not “gotcha” examples that pretend everyone is an idiot. If your response to bad advice is to assume the entire concept is broken, you’re not helping.\n\nPeople aren’t eating rocks. They’re laughing at you for crying that they might be stupid enough to do that, instead of looking at the real problems that need to be fixed, and doing the boring work needed to address those, instead of ranting on social media about how you’re not dumb enough to eat rocks, but supposedly everybody else is.\n\nTagged: #chatgpt, #google gemini, #bad faith criticism, #discourse, #generative ai\nStart03:58 AM\n\n","title":"my-blog.txt","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"request_id":"97b33d663e315781-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"6ee4c1f0-f44f-45fe-88e8-24b79721ea17","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6ee4c1f0-f44f-45fe-88e8-24b79721ea17","children":["1c4286fb-7b66-4a45-b0c9-c19fe0eb6087"]},"1c4286fb-7b66-4a45-b0c9-c19fe0eb6087":{"id":"1c4286fb-7b66-4a45-b0c9-c19fe0eb6087","message":{"id":"1c4286fb-7b66-4a45-b0c9-c19fe0eb6087","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1757217010.0553486,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_quote","url":"file-3mjoFDaML7NL5DwS6sEMcw","domain":"my-blog.txt","text":"\nBobBigMac\nAsk me anything\nArchive\nPosted 21 hours ago\nOn a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’ (AI tweaked version)\nThis is the AI edited version of my entirely handwritten post, On a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’. You can find reasoning for its changes at the end. I thought it might make an interesting contrast.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog. It’s generally gone well, but I want to raise some points…\n\nRewording Issues\nIt’s extremely aggressive when it comes to rewording. I often have to say “use my words” or “stick to my phrasing” three or four times before it stops turning whatever I said into mulch. In GPT-5’s latest 'quick’ mode (basically GPT-3) it’s extremely lazy, so statements like “really THINK about it” or just waiting for lower load times, when it’s more likely to use 'thinking’ mode, seem to help.\n\nGiving it my original text with each repeated imperative, or explaining why I said something in a particular way, can help. But there are things it just doesn’t like: run-on sentences (even those I use for rhythm, humour, or stress) often get chopped into nonsense, and intentional misuse of grammar… well, it really hates that.\n\nConnective Tissue\nIt does a decent job of 'connective tissue.’ If I write a skeet rant as a draft and copy it in, then after I’m done forcing it not to change my phrasing, it can turn it into a post with some flow. But I tend to think between the lines, and my earlier posts read more like 5–7 standalone paragraphs than one coherent piece.\n\nIt’s not as 'fun’ as writing alone, but sometimes useful. Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\n\nTone and Audience\nIt has a decent sense of tone. If I say “fucking terrible policy,” it usually knows I’m exaggerating for effect, but will almost always suggest toning it down. I don’t mind alienating readers: good-faith readers can work with their own emotions, and I’m not interested in writing for bad-faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\n\nEarlier posts on this blog show more empty, corpo-feeling language — back when I hadn’t yet learned how to force it to keep my words, but without the unintentional digs at readers that actually do make people switch off.\n\nResearch Value\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode), it’s invaluable — almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is too steep). You have to tell it to cite sources, specify what sources are acceptable (I avoid newspapers except as support), and enforce rules like “multiple claims can’t rely on one source.” The best sources are researchers, government agencies, universities, and primary datasets — not opinion pieces.\n\nChatGPT and Grok vary a lot. I prefer ChatGPT’s final output, but Grok is excellent for critique. I’ll often ask it for a second opinion with phrases like “tear the arsehole out of this blog post” or “severely criticise this claim, with evidence.”\n\nRed Flags\nA lot of people I’ve talked to (or watched using it) are aware of its limitations, but there are problems:\n\nPeople give their preferred LLM too much agency, lifting responses wholesale without really reading them.\nThey talk about the model as if it “understood” or “felt” things.\nThe press leaves a fog of “stupid” opinions about AI out in the wild, misrepresenting what it does and when to use it.\nNeurodivergence and Flow\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD). When I used to write directly into my dash, I’d often lose the plot halfway: either brain fog or rabbit-holing into tangents. I still do this, but the AI helps me check: “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? Are all the sections connected?” Sometimes it helps me split a messy article into two clearer ones.\n\nSpeed and Structure\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about quality. But it’s too eager to push you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response discourages sitting with a piece. My earlier posts are more like quick takes; now I prefer slower, deeper posts with sources.\n\nPraise and Phrasing\nChatGPT in particular loves to praise you. Even with project voice settings, it’s unavoidable. I once tried to cut the first and last paragraph of every response with a userscript, but the HTML made it unreliable. My workaround: ignore the fluff. The prompt should come from me, and the judgment of success should too. The more you let it take control, the further you drift from meaningful content.\n\nSwearing actually helps. If I swear at it, it follows instructions more closely and does more work. For one project, some of my logs (usually at high-load times) include things like: “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction], like I said, you dick…” It’s partly venting, partly effective. (And no, I would never speak to an actual colleague like that.)\n\nCommunity Use\nIn neurodivergent spaces, I see a lot of people using ChatGPT, sometimes well, sometimes poorly. It’s easy to spot when someone didn’t work their input enough. If you use a free/cheap model, don’t expect much. Even under Plus, GPT-3 and Claude have been lazy since Agent mode got mainstream. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs — not by criticising them for using the tool, but by showing what it does well and what it doesn’t.\n\nReactions to AI Writing\nSome people will dismiss any content they think is AI-written, even when it isn’t. On Reddit, I’ve seen the default retort: “AI slop, garbage opinion.” That’s just lazy. I wrote earlier about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people are writing like AI now — easy-reading rhythm, low-bar accessibility, short paragraphs.\n\nMy Current Use\nSo far, I’m happy using it for:\n\nTesting the strength of a claim\nSuggesting simpler phrasing for complex issues\nBut I’d avoid prompts like “Rewrite this in the style of X,” because it almost never delivers what I want.\n\nFinal Thought\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (I’ve already seen it pushed in corporates I know). But as a workflow tool — used carefully, only for what it’s good at — it’ll stay in my toolbox for now.\n\nEdits the AI made (in ChatGPT’s own words)\nHere’s the reasoning behind the minimal changes I made, stripped of the structural stuff (headings, spacing, etc.):\n\nClarified dense sentences: a few run-ons were split just enough to preserve rhythm without losing meaning (e.g. “mulch” instead of “much,” trimming the overstacked commas).\nRemoved duplicates/repetition: you circled back to some points (like praise-padding, rewording aggression, connective tissue) multiple times; I left them once, where they landed strongest.\nLight wording polish: fixed a couple of small slips that looked accidental rather than intentional (“mulch” vs “much,” “arshole” → “arsehole”), but left deliberate quirks intact.\nContext clues: added a single explanatory aside where an acronym (AuDHD) might throw readers unfamiliar with it.\nTone preservation: all the swearing, snark, and exaggeration stayed — I only smoothed where it risked confusing the point rather than sharpening it.\nThe AI version isn’t “nicer,” it’s just trimmed of redundancies and cleaned of unintentional noise, while leaving your intended noise (humour, rhythm, tangents) intact.\n\nMy 'take’\nThese changes are generally reasonable, except where it dropped a couple of entire points (probably to satisfy its word limiter), you may prefer one or the other, but I try to land somewhere in the middle. I don’t like how LLMs take off ALL the sharp edges, but that is definitely a utility I find useful sometimes.\n\nI’ve recently been using it to write in-depth research reports and important feedback and complaints (like to my GP, mentioned in an earlier blog post). Used as a tool, not a lifestyle, I’m comfortable endorsing AI more broadly, and hope with my upcoming project to highlight some of this value, especially in complex comms, to others in future.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai, #communication\nPosted 21 hours ago with 1 note\nOn a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’\nThis is the entirely handwritten version of this post, you can read: On a few months of writing with an AI 'assistant’ (AI tweaked version) here.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog, there’s an old post about it down there somewhere. It’s generally gone well, but I want to raise some points…\n\nIt’s extremely aggressive when it comes to rewording. I often have to say “use my words” or “stick to my phrasing” three or four times, before it stops turning whatever I said into a mulch. In GPT-5’s latest 'quick’ mode (basically GPT-3) it’s extremely lazy, so currently statements like “really THINK about it” or just trying to avoid peak load times, when it’s more likely to use 'thinking’ mode helps.\nGiving it my original text with each repeated imperative, or explaining why I said something in a particular way can help, but there’s some stuff it just doesn’t like, run-on sentences (even those I use for rhythm, humour, or stress) often get split into two sentences that barely make sense, and intentional misuse of grammar, well… it, really hates, that, absolutely!!!!\nIt does a pretty good job of 'connective tissue’, like if I write a skeet rant as a draft, then copy that in; after I’m done telling it not to change my phrasing or words, it can turn it into a post that has _some_ sense of flow, but I tend to think between the lines, and you can just scroll down and see how earlier posts read more like 5-7 independent paragraphs than a coherent piece.\nIt’s not as 'fun’ as writing alone, but it does occasionally have useful suggestions. Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft… [draft]” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\nIt’s got a reasonable sense of tone, like it knows that if I say “fucking terrible policy” that I’m exaggerating to make a point, but does almost always suggest toning it down to avoid alienating readers. I don’t mind alienating readers, because a good faith reader can use their own emotions to continue digesting a piece, and I’m not interested in writing for bad faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\nIf you scroll down to the earlier posts on this 'blog’, you can see the emptier/corpo language, because I hadn’t learned how to make it say what I said, but without the problematic emotional states that actually do cause readers to check out (like unintentionally criticising the reader themselves).\nThe word-soup feeling diminishes as I added more of my existing articles and more content written directly by me to the project, and as I added more chats, especially because ChatGPT projects now correctly contextualise text files and chats on a project, including instructions.\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode) it’s really invaluable, almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is just a little too steep). You absolutely have to tell it to cite sources, which sources are acceptable (I generally advise no newspaper stories except as support), and how multiple claims shouldn’t rely on a single source, and how authoritative sources come from researchers, government agencies, universities and other primary datasets, not from opinion pieces (except where the research is looking for opinions).\nChatGPT and Grok vary wildly on specific subjects, and I tend to prefer the final output from ChatGPT, but Grok is very good at criticising content, so I’ll often ask it for a 'second opinion’, including phrases like 'tear the arsehole out of this blog post’ or 'severely criticise this claim, citing reasons with evidence’.\nI’ve talked with quite a few people (and seen some using it directly) about how they use these tools, and generally people (at least the people I know) are aware of the limitations and opportunities of these tools, but there are some red flags… a) People give their preferred LLM far too much agency, not only in how they parse and use responses (often just lifting content and barely even reading it before shipping it) but in how they express how the engine understood or felt about the issue. and b) The way the press cover it leaves a lot of 'stupid’ opinions about how AI works out in the wild… often massively misrepresenting what it can do and when to use it.\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD) so when I used to write in my own dash directly, I’d get half-way into an article and lose the plot completely… either through brain-fog, or just through rabbit-holing into a tangent (probably my most difficult-to-overcome behaviour). I still do this in the posts I’m writing myself, but it does come in handy when I’m done writing to ask something like “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? are all the sections connected?” and it’s occasionally helped me take a single piece that gets lost in the middle, and turn that into 2 pieces that each have a little less to say, but better capture and communicate the subject.\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about the quality of results, but it’s really eager to get you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response really discourages chewing over a piece, and my earlier posts demonstrate that. They’re basically just 'takes’, and while I don’t mind posting a take here or there, I prefer the depth of the longer form posts with various supporting citations.\nI also wrote about how ChatGPT in particular loves to celebrate you, give you a pat on the back for being such a smart boy… I’ve tried to mitigate that by setting my project voice, but it’s basically unavoidable. I even tried writing a userscript that cuts off the first and last paragraph of every response, but finding the right HTML elements proved impossible to do reliably. Just don’t read the first and last paragraph of any response from any model, use your old-school banner-blindness. The prompt should always be coming from you, and what you thought about how well it did what you asked for. Every time you let it take control, you can only get further away from valuable/meaningful content.\nSwearing actually fucking helps. When you swear at the engine, it takes your instructions more seriously, makes it slightly less lazy, and aside from the word “THINK” under GPT-5, is one of the few ways to get it to do more real work, and more closely follow what you told it to do. For my main current project, some of my chat logs (mostly from high-load times like Saturday morning) say things like “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction] , like I said, you dick… [claim]”, partly cos it feels good to vent, and it’s a computer so who cares (I would not speak to a human like this, and never ever have. I worked with a guy who did early in my career and he indirectly taught me that’s a terrible way to work, even for a hardcore utilitarian), but also because it really does do a better job in the response.\nThere’s mixed positions on please and thank you. The platforms would rather you didn’t (it does cost them for every response, they’d prefer you to be utilitarian), but realistically the cost is minimal, and when it’s delivering well, it makes _me_ feel better to treat it like a co-writer I respect, so I tend to communicate with it in much the same way I did when I hired freelancers (basically it ate their job, as I no longer have a virtual assistant to pickup my more mundane tasks).\nI’ve noticed a lot of other people in generally 'neurodivergent’ (man, I hate that term, for its 'othering’) spaces using ChatGPT especially, some more than others, and while many are getting real value from being able to construct and analyse complex thoughts with relatively low effort; it’s easy to see when some people didn’t really work their input enough. If you use a cheap/free model, do NOT expect good results. Even under Plus, GPT3 and Claude have been particularly stupid/lazy since the rise of Agent mode on mainstream platforms. It’s no wonder OpenAI decided to just mash their models together under a marshall and call it GPT-5. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs when you see it, not by criticising them for using the tool but by helping them understand what it does well and what it doesn’t.\nMy last major point, is some people will be triggered by any form of AI writing, even if it’s not writing output by an AI. I noticed this especially on reddit, a common retort, even for non-AI based content is something like “low quality AI slop is just a garbage opinion”, but I think that’s just a lazy go-to, as I think one of my earlier posts was about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people started writing like AI for real, because aside from the hypnotic rhythm of its paragraphs, it generally writes text that is easy to digest, especially if you set a lower reading ease.\nOn progress so far, I’m pretty happy with my general use of it in use cases like “Test the strength of this claim” or “Suggest some ways to express this complex issue in plain English”, but I’d probably avoid in future just saying “Rewrite this in the style of these”, because it rarely just gives you what you actually want.\n\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (as I’ve already seen it being pushed on corpos I know), but as a general quality and workflow tool, used only for what it’s good at, it’ll stay in my toolbox for a while.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai\nPosted 23 hours ago\nJournalists making rage, not change\nThis barely researched news story landed on the r/manchester reddit from the guardian yesterday: English councils pay private landlords millions in incentives to house homeless families\n\nimage\nStories like this with no sense of scale always leave me wondering what they _really_ mean, beyond being clickbait, so I looked into it…\n\nFor scope… I’m primarily interested in Manchester (I live here, and they have many more occurences than any other listed region), only in other regions insofar as they compare to Manchester.\n\nI went to the source (Generation Rent) and opened up their data on a computer (since the xlsx-html hide column headers on mobile), switched to the real xlsx and got the headings “Council - Occasions paid an incentive - £ paid in incentives - Highest incentive (£)”. This gives us an average £2958 per ‘occasion paid an incentive’.\n\nWith a max payment of £5980, suggesting a fairly low spread, but can’t find info on exactly who was paid what or when, so 90% of those could have gone to single landlord (unlikely, but possible) over 1138 'occasions’ (best guess, that’s 1138 people or families homed by a landlord who otherwise wouldn’t have let to them because of uncertainty).\n\nFor comparison, the total fund would buy 13-14 'average’ Manchester houses, to bring back into public ownership, or could maybe build 15-20 new houses owned publicly from scratch.\n\nI also put together a 'rough’ estimate of distribution based on reported figures just to inform context.\n\nFor total cost per resident, in Manchester, that’s about £6 each, or ~0.3% of council tax bill funded these incentives. This is slightly less than Enfield (the highest), about the same as Ealing, a little more than Nottingham, and substantially more than Birmingham (£1.45 tho I think that has a larger rural/suburban catchment area where these don’t really apply). London is around £5 per resident.\n\nThe original FOI for Manchester from Generation Rent is here. The wording suggests those occasions paid for 1131 people/families to be homed, but it is unclear about the details, I suspect it would need more FOIs to clarify.\n\n[imo] that seems mostly reasonable to me, but the total spend does support Generation Rent’s case that councils need more tools to use, 0.3% of total council tax paid isn’t nothing, but it’s not a 'tear down the council’ or 'eat all private landlords’ scale problem. Even if a small proportion of the 1000+ people or families are not sleeping on the streets, that’s a pretty good way to spend council money to avoid having to setup a thunderdome :)\n\nAs an unrelated aside, whenever you see “£X MILLIONS” in a headline… if the body of the article doesn’t contain some kind of per-capita or per-subject breakdown, that’s a journalistic failure, usually with the side-effect of creating outrage instead of communicating meaning. The Guardian used to be better than this, cos this type of headline especially belongs in a tabloid, not a real newspaper. Real data makes for real positive outcomes.\n\nWhy does this matter? Surely it’s just a nitpick? What does it matter if the scale isn’t reported? It’s still £3.35m, right?\nIt’s a fairly easy scale to identify, how many people did this money help home? Now we have at least a vague idea.\nIt also helps us identify what other solutions this could afford, and whether they would beat the current outcomes.\nIf you already got 'all the facts’ (or as many as you can), even if the facts don’t support your desired outcomes quite as enthusiastically as you’d prefer, you still have a case that’s harder to tear down or ignore.\nIt prevents readers lazily skipping to conclusions like “ban all private landlords” or “stop the council spending this money”, that make them feel better about complaining, but would harm real home-seekers if the council suddenly had to stop incentivising, but the actual proposal by Generation Rent was not actioned. If you solved the loud problem and not the quiet one, you just made a bigger problem for everybody.\nIt prevents (or at least discourages) 'ragers’ taking up all the oxygen, like on our original reference, the reddit thread. You can find this story in other city subreddits, and I expect on facebook too, with the same kneejerk reactions at various intensities. Placing the problem in context is crucial, or people will take whatever they want from your data, and you will have no way to stop them misrepresenting your objective or the positive outcomes.\nIt’s the right thing to do, even if it makes me look like a dick for nitpicking on bluesky :)\nTagged: #manchester, #council, #guardian, #journalistic malpractice, #ragebait, #clickbait, #journalism, #lazy, #renters, #council tax, #manchester city council\nPosted 2 days ago\nAI commercials don’t think you’re dumb, they’re just lying, legally\nAI ads are weird. Every time you see one, it’s an unimaginably low-stakes scenario: “learn some football bants”, “summarise an email”, “identify this fish”, “help me write a cute little note”. Exchanges so meaningless and empty, you wouldn’t even think to ask them.\n\nNobody actually uses gen AI like that, and everyone knows it, including the advertisers and platform decision-makers. People make fun of them as if the agencies are just clueless, like they genuinely believe the killer app for generative AI is party small talk. But that’s not what’s happening…\n\nThey can’t say what you actually use AI for. They can’t suggest “ask it about your mental health” or “do deep research on why my state just made this new draconian law” or “how do I expand my small business?” or even “how do I answer this email without sounding like a dickhead” and “my partner does this annoying thing, how do I deal with it?” (all common and well-recorded use cases, no moral judgment intended), because the moment they do, they open the entire organisation up to legal action. Visit the subreddit for basically any neurodiversity or mental-health issue, and you’ll find post after post of people using ChatGPT to deal with their problems, or just to feel better after a hard day, often with positive results. The corpos selling these genuinely useful services can’t focus on those though, because that comes with far more baggage than the organisation is willing to carry.\n\nHere are some examples: Google’s Gemini Super Bowl run with “Dream Job” and “Party Blitz” (The Verge, Google blog), Microsoft’s Copilot “Your everyday AI companion” Super Bowl ad and its “conversation starters” demos (CBS News, YouTube), Meta’s Ray-Ban Meta glasses Super Bowl campaign with Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt and the cringey “Parent Presentation” spot they pulled almost instantly (Meta, People, TidBITS, The Verge, Business Insider), OpenAI’s “The Intelligence Age” Super Bowl debut (OpenAI, Adweek, The Verge), and Anthropic’s five-second Claude bumper during the 2024 game (Axios).\n\nAI companies like to pretend that their biggest problem is “sometimes our responses contain innaccurate or out of date information”, and hedge/disclaim that right next to the main input textbox, and that’s generally what the press and outrage crowds tend to focus on how the AI can’t generate an accurate diagram of the female reproductive system, for example, but the real potential for harm of AI comes from when it technically can deliver information, but perhaps it shouldn’t, or even if it should, it’s still trusting you, the meatspace-based human, to action or implement based on its information reasonably, and not get mad (or litigious) if it all goes wrong.\n\nAn LLM can tell you to eat rocks, and that’s obviously stupid, but if it tells you to swallow your feelings and get on with your depressing job (even if it hedges a little), or you ask it about something uncomplicated, and its pursuit of balance or of avoiding being contentious/edgy responds with some advice that sounds good but isn’t if you think about it (because it’s trained largely on reddit/quora/etc which are full of terrible advice of their own forms), that’s an output of the system the organisation becomes liable for. So ads just pick the lowest possible stakes and pretend that’s all you’d ever use it for. If you use it for something else, that’s entirely on you.\n\nAI commercials don’t think you’re stupid, their internal data definitely shows them clearly what users are asking for, and if anything I suspect whoever at the marketing agency who puts these things out has said “people know what AI can actually do, they know these things would never happen like this” in a quiet meeting. I’d even bet the lawyers signing off on these ads know exactly what they’re doing, but as long as nobody admits it, there’s an entire system of legal defense that just keeps comfortably rolling along, trying to find new ways of taking your money by providing an always-on ‘e-friend’ who solves all your problems.\n\nTagged: #ai, #ads, #generative ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #gemini, #meta ai, #apple intelligence, #commercials, #marketing, #liability, #lawsuits, #bullshit, #lonliness, #lonely, #mental health\nPosted 3 days ago\nEveryone’s Wrong About How AI Works (Including Me)\nSo many people are so confidently wrong about how AI works that it actually makes me more confident the models’ own confidently-wrong output is based on real human input. They’re just reflecting us back at ourselves — smug mistakes in, smug mistakes out.\n\nAnd yeah, I’m in that pool too. I’ll happily waffle on about prompt clarity and outputs under load, and I’m happy to point and laugh at the vagina museum confidently claiming “That’s how LLMs work” in the middle of a thirty or forty tweet thread where every single post is weighed down with their own hallucinations and imaginative explanations with absolutely no connection to reality, because while everyone loves the vagina museum enough for tens of thousands of people to retweet and like their nonsense, literally nobody in their audience has any real idea how the tech works beyond ‘magic box that obviously can’t draw the female reproductive system’, because of course it can’t, that’s not what it’s for.\n\nI like to think (in a lazy crutch kind of way) of LLMs like a bag of scrabble tiles, and especially with images, you tip out the pieces and get mad that it doesn’t spell antidisestablishmentarianism, cos you’re pretty sure you put all the letters in.\n\nSometimes I think the most plausible explanation is that LLMs are just portals into some parallel dimension where an infinite sweatshop of overworked gig-econony ghostwriters are cranking out all our mediocre replies in some frozen time-space continuum. Honestly, if we discovered that tomorrow, nobody would even blink — it’d feel about right cos that’s how we build everything already anyway.\n\nAnd if we’re all going to be confidently wrong, maybe I should just choose to believe the whole thing runs on a single haunted qubit forming an einstein-rosen bridge in a basement somewhere. At least that’s a fun lie, and it’s not much more ridiculous than the reality of gazillions of grains of sand computing probability tables until they hit boundary conditions that collapse into a picture of a lizard lady with three tits or a screed about how AI works.\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #generativeai, #confidentlywrong, #altreality, #shitpost, #techhumour, #dead internet, #vibes, #rant, #skeets, #lol\nPosted 3 days ago\nOn the joy of being a bit of a dick to solve problems\nHad a couple of good work days, had a few projects come together into a cohesive set, and discovered I’m a pretty competent script-writer when I take the time to do a proper job — and the icing on the cake… My neighbour just told me she’s finally getting rid of her fucking cockerel. \\o/ [coming up Milhouse dot gif]\n\nAs a bonus: after weeks on a strict diet of mostly potatoes and bean mash, I’ve got snacks again 🤤\n\nAt the start of the year I promised myself I’d stop ignoring the little things that make life worse. Stop listening to the voice that says “just tolerate it, don’t be a dick.” Instead: fix them, nudge, ask, push a bit. Nothing massive, but just trying to solve these things is starting to pay off and my internal “am I being a dick?” counter has barely ticked up.\n\nIf I have any advice for tackling problems that aren’t your fault (those are a bit harder) it’s this: show people the evidence. A simple graph or log can make it obvious who the real dickhead is, and that’s harder to argue with than just venting.\n\nThe next project is pulling together GP practice reviews across a dozen sites run by the same management company, and comparing them to their competitors. Because sometimes the way you get change isn’t by ranting — it’s by drawing a chart that makes everyone else realise just how badly they’re failing, as long as you can present it in a way you’re confident is helpful and informative, and not just ranting.\n\nSometimes fixing life isn’t about grand revolutions. Sometimes it’s about fewer 5 a.m. cock-a-doodle-dos, and finally getting crisps back in your life.

On a good day, with low load, it’s barely distinguishable from magic. It sucks because its incredible power is so easy for people to use against you. All the stuff you’ve left online — the posts, the scraps, the off-hand comments — that’s ammo. And nobody else is going to clean it up. You have to.\n\nIf you’ve got any kind of digital footprint, try it. Open any LLM in a private chat, switch memory/history off, and just ask it about you. That’s the surface-level stuff it already knows. But if you really want to see what it can do, gather your posts like a scammer would, feed them in, and ask it to make assumptions. What do I like? What am I insecure about? What would I fall for? It doesn’t take much.\n\nChatGPT used to try and block this. It would stall or redirect. But since Grok launched, the guardrails have thinned out, and you can do it on either one now. The system message technically says “no personal data about anyone unless it’s public and relevant.” But that’s not an and, it’s an or. Make it public, or argue it’s relevant, and the model plays along. Strip out names, call it fiction, drop in a fake world — it still works. Those rules don’t protect you. They protect the platform’s lawyers.\n\nThis isn’t new either. The same advice applied back in 2011. I built a system for a major media org that scraped and connected data about their users and their families the old-fashioned way. We called it “the Facebook you don’t know you’re part of,” and eventually convinced management to kill it. For scope: the whole point was to sell cars to the wealthiest identifiable member of any household, based on their share history and a handful of behavioural assumptions. Off six or seven data points, it got the hierarchy right about ninety percent of the time. You are leaky.\n\nAnd here’s the thing: our system didn’t even need social media, and it only took a few devs a few months to build. Then one day we added a small feature that suddenly made it so invasive we all just looked at each other and realised we couldn’t ship it. Because the org wasn’t evil, management agreed. It was disturbingly easy to build, and could have been a secret nightmare. I still remember the look on one manager’s face when we explained it — we made it sound difficult and expensive, but he was excited anyway. Most of the rest were horrified. Luckily there were too many layers of management to ship it then, but plenty of others in companies all over the world picked up the baton and sprinted full pelt until they couldn’t sprint any faster… then they needed more, and now we have LLMs.\n\nI haven’t tried (yet), but I reckon with the right phrasing to avoid the weak guardrails (pretend you only want to build it about yourself maybe), you could ask Grok to recreate the whole thing today. And it’d probably do a decent job on the very first try — especially if you had a specific target in mind.\n\nSo yeah. The tech works. It’s almost magic when it isn’t under load. That’s the problem though, if you don’t clean up your trail, the techbros are going to ingest it (if they haven’t already) and it’s going to follow you, because your info is being worked into the models beneath the models (GPT-5 already layering on top of old models, and as above, so below, you’re stuffed in the catacombs). It’s not like google search where you can just file a request to have your database row deleted, there’s no getting it out, what you have online today is what you’ll be known for, forever.\n\nGPT-5 system messages, ish\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #grok, #chatgpt, #privacy, #dead internet, #data, #safety, #tech rant, #generative ai, #communication, #genai, #politics, #personal data\nPosted 3 days ago with 3 notes\nNobody at YouTube Watches YouTube\nI know this because of something so stupid it borders on parody. The YouTube TV app — which is basically the same web client everywhere now — still doesn’t remember if you want subtitles on. Every single time you open it, or even when it nudges you to re-select your profile after being idle, you have to go dig into menus, find the CC toggle they’ve buried deeper with each redesign, and turn captions back on.\n\nIn 2025, in homes where kids are running around, people are multitasking, and half the viewing is with the volume down, subtitles aren’t an “edge case.” They’re baseline. They’re also not just about convenience — they’re about accessibility. If you’re hard of hearing, you literally can’t use the app properly without turning CC on every time. That’s not a quirk. That’s a broken product.\n\nAnd it’s not like this hasn’t been raised. Hard-of-hearing communities have been complaining to deaf ears (lol) for years. Anyone who watches TV with captions would notice in about thirty seconds. There are at least thirty or forty real people in the YouTube product and design chain who could have caught this, flagged it, or fixed it with probably a single line of code. Instead, it’s been ignored, and in their latest “big refresh” they somehow made it worse.\n\nWhich leads me back to the claim. If even one decision-maker at YouTube — from the lowest PM to the highest-paid boardroom executive — actually relied on captions at home, this wouldn’t still be a problem. The only plausible explanation is that none of them do. That’s the only way something this obvious survives multiple product cycles.\n\nAnd that’s what really gets me. As a designer, it’s not just annoying — it’s insulting. It’s a reminder that the platform with a monopoly on so much creative culture is run by people who don’t use it the way most of us do. The people making the calls aren’t living with the same pain points, so those problems never get solved. They’re invisible at the top, glaring everywhere else.\n\nAnd sure — in the grand scheme of YouTube’s endless list of backwards decisions and neglected features, this is a small one. But it’s also telling. If they can’t be bothered to fix the basics, what chance is there they’ll tackle the bigger failures?\n\nSomeone really does need to disrupt YouTube.\n\nTagged: #youtube, #design, #accessibility, #enshittification, #subtitles, #rant, #deafawareness, #deafculture, #hard of hearing\nPosted 6 days ago\nCrypto Seems Stupid, But It Solves a Problem (Just Probably Not for You, Yet)\nCrypto as an industry is stupid. Let’s get that out of the way. It’s a clown car of scams, cult vibes, and half-baked libertarian fantasies about freedom without responsibility. It is, in the broadest sense, ridiculous.\n\nBut here’s the awkward bit: it actually does solve a problem. Just not your problem. At least, not yet.\n\nThe Problem Nobody Wants to Admit\nThe money layer of the internet isn’t neutral. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal — these aren’t just pipes you can pour payments through. They’re gatekeepers, and they know it. They’ve cut off porn platforms. They’ve throttled sex educators. They’ve quietly shut down queer creators, kink communities, even writers who looked too adjacent to the “wrong” politics.\n\nAnd now it’s games too — recent reporting shows Steam and Itch have both been pressured by payment processors (last I read, they denied it). Even entirely normal hustles and small creators get hit, sometimes just for TOS violations or false flags. People lose their income overnight, with no recourse, because some fringe product or anonymous report tripped a system designed to protect the most powerful customers, not the real people using it.\n\nWhy Crypto Looks Like the Wrong Answer\nCrypto has earned its reputation. Scams, pump-and-dumps, rug-pulls, and plenty of users who talk like failed cult leaders. It’s been lumped in with the dark web since the start. While it does enable shady stuff, it doesn’t have to enable only that.\n\nAnd despite the myths, most crypto isn’t really anonymous; they’re pseudonymous. Every transaction is public, forever. If investigators already have a thread, they can pull it.\n\nThen there’s the energy debate. Proof-of-work mining is wasteful, sure — but newer tokens don’t drink the ocean. Even with the worst offenders, the problem often comes down to bad infrastructure and perverse incentives. Companies like Nvidia have no reason to reinvent chips when the old ones sell fine. The system rewards inefficiency because that’s what pays.\n\n…But It Does Fix This One\nHere’s the rub: if you’re a sex worker suddenly cut off from payment processors, or a queer creator flagged as “brand unsafe,” or someone whose platform got kneecapped because Stripe panicked about “reputational risk,” crypto might be your only option left standing.\n\nStablecoins in particular are boring, which is exactly what you want from money. They let people send and receive without begging permission from a boardroom of executives who’ve never heard of you and wouldn’t admit they canceled you even if you asked. Yes, the current US administration is fumbling regulation in a way that makes stablecoins look like just another scam coin. But some form of responsible regulation would be welcome — and overdue.\n\nAnd you don’t have to use Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or whatever fresh coin the nerds are yelling about this week (hint, it’s 99.9% probably a scamcoin if it’s come out in the last few years). As long as everyone involved agrees it’s pretty stable, or you’re in and out quickly (or comfortable holding volatility in your pocket), any token will do. The nerds deserve mockery for their blind optimism, but they’re not entirely wrong that used responsibly, it has value.\n\nThe “Yet”\nMaybe that’s not your problem. Maybe you’ve got a regular job, a respectable bank account, and no reason to worry about whether your income stream will vanish overnight because some corpo compliance reviewer didn’t like the shape of your business.\n\nBut the choke point isn’t theoretical. It’s already here. Entire groups are being financially deplatformed right now. Maybe you don’t need crypto — until suddenly you do.\n\nPay Attention\nNobody’s asking you to jump in with both feet. But understand what it actually is because maybe one day you’ll need it — or maybe a creator you like will get cut off, and you’ll want a way to slip them some support.\n\nThis matters more as platforms corporate-ize. YouTube, Twitch, Patreon — all of them focus on fewer, bigger players once the VC money takes the reins. It happened in microstock: the floor kept rising until most contributors were shoved into the basement to fight over scraps.\n\nCrypto isn’t utopia. It won’t buy you coffee at Starbucks anytime soon (or at least not outside of the valley). But for all its absurdity, it’s one of the very few escape hatches left in a financial system that wants everything channeled between two high walls, sterile and market-ready, like pigs driven to slaughter.\n\nYou don’t have to like it. You don’t even have to use it. But it already exists, and it already works. It costs you basically nothing to understand the option — and you might be glad you did.\n\nTagged: #crypto, #cryptocurrency, #bitcoin, #ethereum, #stablecoins, #fintech, #financial censorship, #deplatformed, #payment processors, #mutual aid, #swers, #sexwork, #queer creators, #adult content, #censorship, #platform politics, #compliance capitalism, #tech rant\nPosted 1 week ago\nWhy you should use AI for art\nGen AI’s uptake has been wild, even though it’s far from a perfect tool. It’s already fucked over a million or more commercial artists worldwide by swamping every once-viable digital content market with slop. And it’s not just because the tools are bad—most “hustlers” trying to make hay while the sun shines (think markets like KDP, POD, or microstock, though the last one’s less “swamped” and more out-competed by free crappy images of whatever you can imagine) haven’t really reacted to the influx yet.\n\nMy main issue isn’t with AI adoption overall. I think it’s been over-adopted long before it’s actually good, but it is already occasionally useful when deployed in the right places and the right ways—as a tool that multiplies force, not as a worker replacement.\n\nThe problem’s with the irresponsible adoption: platforms that can’t tell the difference between slop and real value, and the absence of systems to determine that, because they’re too busy trying to leverage gen AI themselves, and not busy enough preventing exploitation by it. Eventually, those platforms will have to catch up or die.\n\nThere’s an argument about gen AI where it doesn’t belong, like spewing bullshit onto social media. But the biggest problem isn’t that they “stole” literally every image they could find to build the systems in the first place—regulators are now letting them get away with it, because it technically doesn’t violate copyright.\n\nCopyright’s on the exact words you used, not the style of words you tend toward; on the exact brush strokes, not your general use of phthalo blue (or however you spell it) and a palette knife. Likewise, intellectual property is the names and places in your world, not that you tend to set scenes in space with a big-titted lizard lady and a talking cat. People got mad at something nobody saw coming, so it’s not surprising there weren’t really any tools to stop it.\n\nAnyway, onto my story.\nThe short version: once upon a time, I was a microstock photographer and illustrator (a mediocre one, that’s fine, not everybody has to be Picasso). Eventually, loosely a video-illustrator of sorts (shaders to video). Going into around 2016 with somewhere near 10,000 pieces of content in my portfolio—not exactly earning a strong living, but earning enough to have been worth the time to make them. Well, microstock fell off a cliff (at least for me and everyone except the top 3% of producers) as the market consolidated (I won’t get into microstock history, but it was once a thriving industry). The better producers out-competed me (fairly), the agencies hoovered up or destroyed each other, and Unsplash and co came along and took the edge cases and convenience users, dropping my income to 20% of the peak. Even after adding 15,000 videos or so to my portfolio, that started okay, then dipped too as the agencies who ingested it struggled to keep them relevant or I got outcompeted in their algorithms.\n\nSo I shifted into print on demand. I lost track of how many designs in my portfolios years ago, but I’m pretty sure it’s at least half a million overall, maybe more—I honestly have no idea. My designs are basic, but I made them all myself, with the aid of scripts and tools I built, and put in the legwork to tag them and upload them. They paid a little… until gen AI came along (what, like 2021?) and bam, all of a sudden print on demand wasn’t viable cos every store—Cafepress, Teepublic, Redbubble, Spreadshirt, Zazzle, and I’m sure half a dozen I’ve forgotten—all got swamped by pretty poor quality, but technically passable free upsized Stable Diffusion characters with too many fingers and not enough characters in the text. But customers aren’t that bothered if all they want is a mug that says “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my morning cock” for less than twenty bucks. So POD dropped to 10% of its peak too (maybe less by now, I don’t bother to check anymore)…\n\nI actively encourage artists, especially those who once earned a real living, to use whatever AI tools they want or need to—to make up for their loss in sales, to leverage for more work, for happier clients, for faster throughput. Because commercial art isn’t always about being the best; it’s often just about getting enough work done in each new day to keep the lights on and the Photoshop subscription paid (I’ll cover this another day).\n\nWhen these whining kids on social media get triggered by a lazy article that has a “not just x, but y” conceit or an image of Sonic with too many fingers (does Sonic even have fingers?), because they feel like it stole their furry fan art from those 2 images they were proud of posting on Tumblr 10 years ago, I don’t give a fuck…\n\nThe entire market for commercial art got wiped out time and time again, and people have been stealing my images on the internet this entire millennium, and I never complained about it because that’s what the internet is. It’s stealing the Sonic IP so you can have him kissing a real girl in your lazy fanfic if you want to. And getting triggered at regular people just discovering the joy of creation for the first time—because they weren’t raised with enough time or energy to get into making their own work when they were entitled kids…\n\nI say let them make whatever trash they want with AI, let Disney cram it into every corner they want to, and I’ll gladly look at and maybe even enjoy it, because art isn’t just the execution, art is the idea\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #aiuptake, #commercialart, #microstock, #pod, #kdp, #artists, #slop, #hustlers, #platforms, #copyright, #generative ai, #disney, #ai, #business, #commercial, #stock photography\nPosted 1 week ago\nWhy is everyone so mad about asylum hotels?\nI didn’t understand this issue very well, so I did a deep dive, and here’s what I learned…\n\nIf you’ve read the headlines lately, you’d think local councils are writing cheques to Premier Inn and Travelodge for thousands of asylum seekers. That’s not actually true — but the reality is messier, and that’s why everyone’s shouting past each other.\n\nWho really pays for hotels?\nThe hotel contracts are signed and paid for by the Home Office — not your local council. The National Audit Office (NAO) sets this out clearly in its work on the Home Office’s asylum accommodation contracts (NAO briefing, May 2025). In 2023/24, the Home Office expected to spend £4.7bn on asylum support, including £3.1bn on hotels (NAO report, Mar 2024). In 2024/25, hotel spending ran at about £108m per month — roughly £1.3bn for the year (Reuters fact check, Jun 2025; see also NAO, May 2025).\n\nSo why are councils angry?\nBecause while they don’t pay the hotel bill, they do pay for everything that comes with it:\n\nSchools and childcare, safeguarding and social care.\nHousing and homelessness support when people leave hotels — whether granted status or evicted.\nLocal services like waste collection, environmental health and community safety.\nThe Local Government Association says councils receive no funding for hotels and want the same per‑bed support that exists for other accommodation types (LGA briefing, May 2024). Case in point: Hillingdon reports a £5m annual pressure linked to supporting people leaving hotels, with a cumulative shortfall over £16m (Hillingdon Council, Jul 2025). Glasgow forecast £26.5m of asylum‑related costs in 2024/25 (Glasgow City HSCP paper, Jan 2025).\n\nThis all lands after a decade of squeezed local budgets. Independent analysis shows core local government spending remains below 2010/11 in real terms (Institute for Government, Jul 2024; see also NAO, Feb 2025).\n\nWhy did the central bill drop?\nNot because the Home Office suddenly got efficient. The drop is mainly from using fewer hotels, packing more people into remaining sites, and shifting to cheaper options like large sites or other accommodation models. The NAO documents hotel closures and plans to reduce reliance on them (NAO report, Mar 2024). The Migration Observatory estimates hotel accommodation averaged about £170 per person per night in 2024/25 — far more than other options (Migration Observatory, Aug 2025). The House of Commons Library explains the policy shift to barges and large sites to cut hotel use (Commons Library, Jul 2023).\n\nWhy are councils going to court now?\nRecent legal challenges (like the Epping case) argue hotels can’t be repurposed this way without planning permission. That’s about where hotels are used, not ending hotel use everywhere. After the High Court ruling, the government said it would appeal and manage closures “in an orderly way” (Reuters, Aug 2025; also Guardian, Aug 2025).\n\nDo councils get any central funding at all?\nYes, but it’s fragmented and often doesn’t match actual local costs. Examples include the Asylum Dispersal Grant and Move On Grant funding instructions to local authorities (GOV.UK Dispersal Grant 2025–26; GOV.UK Move On Grant, Mar 2025). The LGA continues to push for proper funding tied to the pressures councils face (LGA campaign explainer).\n\nWhy “Stop the Boats” is such a stupid slogan\n“Stop the Boats” sounds simple, but it’s an undeliverable demand. Britain has no jurisdiction over where the boats set off from, no control over the wars, persecution, or other disasters that push people onto them, and no runway left in the countries of origin after decades of bombing, interventions, and half‑baked foreign policy. You can’t stop people fleeing danger with a soundbite.\n\nThat’s why it works politically: it’s a perfect wedge issue. It promises a solution that can’t be delivered, so whichever government fails can be painted as weak, and whichever opportunist shouts loudest can look like a saviour. Even if they took power, they’d be in the same situation — the only policies left would be cruel, extreme, and harmful to everyone involved.\n\nA better approach would be the opposite: quicker and fairer asylum decisions, investment in schools, health centres and libraries to support both new arrivals and existing residents, and proper public spending that strengthens communities. Building capacity is a force multiplier. It helps everyone.\n\nSo who’s really footing the bill?\nAll of us. The Home Office still spends billions centrally on hotels and asylum support (see NAO above). Councils then pay for the knock‑on local costs — with some grants, but large gaps remaining. That means council tax rises and service cuts are still on the table in many areas (IFS, Jun 2024; Commons Library, Jul 2025). The numbers move around, but the bill never disappears.\n\nImmigration isn’t the root of all our problems though, it’s barely even visible in the budget.\n\nimage\nPeople are angry… Some are angry for stupid racist reasons, some because they just don’t want to hear foreign on the bus or are terrified of muslims after decades of demonisation, some because their councils are broke and the general sense of social rot is spreading, and some because the whole thing feels like a giant shell game where the poorest communities always end up carrying the weight.\n\nThe overall cost just isn’t that much compared to the many many other problems that its convenient for the halls of power to pretend aren’t there, because most people have never seen what the budget really looks like, so of course they’re going to be easier to deal with if they’re not complaining about real problems, but instead complaining about problems you could fix for the cost of a couple of hospitality villages if you really wanted it to go away.\n\nThis Labour government seems unable to raise taxes in the places that would raise funds, won’t means-test the largest expenditures (like the pension, even though it could save £25 billion for a cost of less than half a billion), won’t pursue tech companies or multinationals who export wealth, won’t push any policies that might stunt ‘growth’ (despite there being little to no evidence for it), and have no power to establish new exports as more money leaves local economies than flow into them, but let’s not make this about Brexit ;)\n\nThe short version is, immigrants of any kind are not a big line item in anyone’s budget, the costs are tiny in reality, but they’re an easy target, vulnerable, visible, and all the answers are way more complicated than they seem if all you hear/read are soundbites from Farage and his fellow opportunists, or headlines from any news source that has an interest in pretending it’s simple so they can offer the most appealing answers.\n\nTagged: #asylum, #immigration, #refugees, #stoptheboats, #ukpolitics, #councils, #austerity, #racism, #publicservices, #housingcrisis, #shellgame, #wedgepolitics, #community, #stop the boats, #britain\nPosted 1 week ago\nCancel Culture has never cancelled anyone*\nCancel culture doesn’t exist. Not in the way people swear blind it does. You don’t get erased. You don’t vanish. You get a headline, a timeout, then a new gig.\n\nMel Gibson snarled his way back to Oscar nods, Johnny Depp waltzed into Cannes, James Franco slipped into European indies, Louis C.K. bagged a Grammy, Aziz Ansari shrugged it off with a Netflix drop, Shane Gillis went from SNL fired to SNL host, Gina Carano swapped Disney for Christian schlock, Kevin Hart kept the stadiums, Nick Cannon strolled back into Viacom, Roseanne Barr toured, Kanye West sold out again, Morgan Wallen topped charts, Marilyn Manson booked a tour, Shia LaBeouf turned up in Coppola’s Megalopolis, Dave Chappelle never even sat down long enough to notice. Cancelled? No. Just briefly inconvenienced.\n\nThe only real rule: if you’re in prison, you’re off the board. Weinstein, R. Kelly, Danny Masterson — yeah, you’re not back, yet.\n\n*And then the tiny minority that make up our asterisk. The ones who aren’t inside but still didn’t claw back a platform. Bill Cosby, free but radioactive. Michael Richards, one racist meltdown and done, for now. Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, out of the anchor chair with nowhere else to go.\n\nAnd then there’s Martha Stewart, the exception to the exception. She did the time, five months for insider trading, came out and played it like a badge of honour — prison as a rebrand. Her career was already fading, the jail stint shot it full of life, and she’s been riding that wave ever since, cooking shows and memes and a Snoop Dogg side-hustle that made her cooler than she ever was before.\n\nEveryone else? Cancellation is just another visibility bump. A career pivot. A rebrand. The “left” pretend it’s justice, the “right” scream it’s exile — but look around. The bellends in question faced no real consequence beyond a sabbatical followed by another paycheck. To actually stay cancelled you’ve got to be properly heinous, AND an utter prick to work with. Otherwise? You’re not cancelled.

The things that make life worse for people here every single day. Instead the noise is all about “stop the boats.”, despite immigration costs being barely 2%-3% (much less, like way below 1% if you only consider ‘illegals’ or 'irregular migration’ if you prefer corpo-speak) of the budget.\n\nThe flag-shaggers terrorising immigrants in this city aren’t helping — they’re making everything worse. We can’t do anything about the boats, we don’t control where they come from. And yeah, asylum needs fixing — but it should be funded centrally, not dumped on local councils that can’t even fix a pothole after years of Tory cuts. And it sure as hell shouldn’t be public money lining hotel chains’ pockets to lock vulnerable people up like prisoners.\n\nThe whole thing is just a wedge issue. A distraction. Designed to keep people snapping at each other while the real enemies — the corporate interests and wealth hoarders — strip this city bare and laugh at us for falling for it.\n\nLabour came in promising to help people, and just ran riot over the country with more Tory-lite policy, keeping their gerry-mandering and mandatory photo ID discouraging poorer voters from having any say in change. It’s not surprising Reform are gaining ground because we’re ALL sick of it, wherever you land on the political spectrum.\n\nInstead of screaming at each other over boats we can’t control, we should be screaming at the people who do control things here: the ones running this city into the ground. Demand better housing, proper funding for people who need it most, working public services, safe roads, real mental health care. That’s not left or right, and certainly not a 'culture’ problem.\n\nTagged: #manchester, #homelessness, #poverty, #nhs collapse, #infrastructure, #gentrification, #class war, #refugees welcome\nPosted 1 week ago\nGenerative AI and the Illusion of Work\nGenerative AI isn’t just a tool, it’s a form of intellectual retail therapy — the sense of progress without the pain of actual delivery.\n\nFor those of us with projectitis — always starting, rarely finishing — the fit is perfect. Fire off a prompt, get back an outline, a roadmap, a code scaffold. It feels like momentum. It looks like work. But it’s no different to shuffling your to-do list: activity disguised as progress.\n\nThe machine is tuned for this. Every output arrives padded with positive reinforcement. “Here’s your great idea, made real.” That little surge of satisfaction is the same feedback loop that keeps social media addictive. You don’t need to publish, launch, or finish anything. You just need to ask, and you’re rewarded with the feeling of accomplishment.\n\nGPT-5 stripped out much of the fawning affirmation, and suddenly people who’d been using it as an emotional support device felt the loss, not just of its warmth, but of its comforting reassurance that you’re great.\n\nGenerative AI is excellent at massaging your brain into believing you’re productive. But believing isn’t the same as doing. It’s a mirror that flatters, not a partner that delivers.\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #chatgpt, #productivity, #procrastination, #projectitis, #illusionofwork, #llms, #artificialintelligence, #dopamine, #techculture\nPosted 2 weeks ago\nBuying Games for the Shelf\nWe’re living in a FOMO bubble. Not the dot-com (lol), not the housing market (tho we are) — but lower-stakes digital backlog bubble. People are buying games they never play, stacking them hundreds deep in their libraries, just to have them available.\n\nThe numbers make it clear:\n\nOn PC, surveys show 24% of owned games are never played at all. Steam’s own data has clocked it higher, with ~37% of registered games never even launched.\nEven when people do launch a game, they often don’t stick. Achievement unlock rates show the drop-off. On Xbox, only 52% of players beat the first boss in Hellblade II; in Starfield, 25% never even reached space. In Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, 43% never left the tutorial country. Steam and PlayStation tend to fare better — but the pattern holds.\nIt’s not literally “90% don’t clear the first hurdle,” but the drop-off is still brutal. Between a quarter who never play at all and another 40–60% who stall before the first proper chapter, you’re looking at the overwhelming majority never making it past the opening act. And that’s staggering when you think about how much money changes hands just to dabble.\n\nNow zoom out. The global games market in 2024 hit $182.7 billion. Mobile is about half of that ($92B), console another quarter ($51B), and PC the rest (~$43B). Of that, somewhere between 40% and 55% — $70 to $100 billion — comes directly from time-limited monetisation. Battle passes, seasonal events, gacha banners, rotating cosmetic shops. FOMO by design.\n\nThat’s the real engine: not just buying to play, but buying so you don’t miss out. Buying because the skin is only here this week, because the pass expires in 30 days, because if you don’t grab it now, it’s gone.\n\nPut it together and you’ve got a market propped up by two linked illusions:\n\nIllusion of intent: people think they’ll play the games they buy. Half don’t.\nIllusion of scarcity: people think they’ll miss out if they don’t buy now. Often they won’t.\nIf you’re the kind of player who buys FIFA every year, or drops sixty or seventy bucks on the latest Call of Duty or Assassin’s Creed and spends the next twelve months slowly working through it, you’re probably getting your money’s worth. The economics make sense. But the moment you’ve got a backlog — even a modest one — the numbers go sideways. You’re almost certainly spending at least double what you should, and for plenty of people with hundreds of unplayed games in their libraries, it’s many times more than that.\n\nGames are fun, sure. People still sink hundreds of hours into the big ones. But the industry is running on backlog economics and FOMO fuel. It’s a strange kind of bubble: the value isn’t in what you play, but in what you buy and never touch.\n\nMaybe it bursts one day, maybe it doesn’t. What’s certain is that subscription platforms like Game Pass add another layer of pressure: developers now have to build for discovery churn as much as for play. That’s fine if you’re Ubisoft and can pump out an Assassin’s Creed every other year with DLC on top, but for smaller studios the bubble is harsher. They can pivot fast, sure, but one flop in a backlog-driven, subscription-shaped market can still wipe them out.\n\nTagged: #gaming, #videogames, #backlog, #steam, #xbox, #playstation, #gamepass, #fomo, #dlc, #subscription\nPosted 2 weeks ago with 1 note\nDiplomatic Incompetence\nAt my recent GP’s patient participation meeting (trying to get them to fix their many problems), several patients used the word incompetent about reception staff. Not careless, not under-trained — “incompetent”. The practice manager’s summary on wrap-up: “We’re facing training challenges.”\n\nI pushed back: “I think we said incompetent.” She replied: “I was being diplomatic.” Then we moved on…\n\nThat was probably sensible in the room (no need for the distraction over semantics). But here’s the thing: if you downgrade incompetence to a “training challenge,” you all but guarantee nothing will change. Training challenges are easy — PDF modules, refresher courses, maybe a workshop. Incompetence isn’t. Incompetence means people who are disengaged, burnt out, or actively hostile to the patients they’re supposed to help. You can’t train that away. You have to either change the system and the staff, or replace them. And that requires naming the problem honestly.\n\nThis isn’t just a healthcare thing. It’s the entire operating mode of UK Labour under Starmer. Every crisis is framed as a “challenge.” Structural wealth extraction? A productivity challenge. Exploitation baked into gig work? A regulation challenge. House-building collapse? A planning challenge.\n\nEverything becomes small, manageable, “reasonable” — because the people at the top are too busy being diplomatic to those with power to risk saying what’s true: these aren’t challenges, they’re rot. And rot doesn’t shift because you call it something nicer.\n\nYou can train through a challenge. You can’t workshop incompetence.\n\nTagged: #politics, #uk, #labour, #corpospeak, #healthcare\nPosted 2 weeks ago\nAI Isn’t Draining the Colorado River — Your Politics Are\nIt’s interesting how pros have been patiently explaining how data centres and AI actually use water, but because everyone’s so deeply triggered, it’s become fashionable to pretend that generating a single image of a lizard warrior with five tits is single-handedly draining the Colorado River.\n\nAs if decades of infrastructure neglect, perverse incentives for private land management, hands-off regulation, and the chronic inability to fund the projects experts actually recommended had nothing to do with why water’s short in half the western world, even without considering climate change.\n\nBut that’s not the story the mainstream press wants.

Too much news, too much noise, too much “urgent” stuff that — if you squint — turns out to be neither urgent nor stuff.\n\nIt’s not that none of it matters. It’s that your attention is finite, and the world will gladly burn it on things you can’t change, can’t fix, or don’t actually care about once you stop doomscrolling.\n\n1. Is this a thing I can change?\nIf no — park it. Read about it if it’s interesting, but don’t burn emotional fuel on it. Awareness does not equal responsibility.\n\n2. Is this a thing that actually affects me or people I care about?\nIf it’s happening in a domain where I have zero stake and zero influence, it’s probably not my fire to fight.\n\n3. Is the problem new, or just today’s flavour of an old one?\nIf it’s the same rot as last week but with a fresh headline, maybe I don’t need to rehearse my outrage again.\n\n4. Is there a source of truth I trust on this?\nIf all I’ve got is vibes, memes, and people yelling into feeds, maybe I don’t have enough to form a useful opinion yet.\n\n5. Will talking about it do anything?\nIf my words aren’t going to change the outcome — not even my own mindset — then maybe this is just venting. And that’s fine, but let’s call it what it is and be comfortable with that.\n\n6. Am I reacting to the thing, or to the way it’s being presented?\nA lot of what passes for “news” is just someone picking a camera angle for maximum twitch. Make sure the story, not the packaging, is what’s got my attention.\n\nYou can’t solve everything, you can’t even meaningfully track everything — but you can keep your focus for the things that are actually in your reach.\n\nThink of it like the Serenity Prayer, but without the theological framing:\nGrant me the clarity to see which fires are mine to fight, the focus to put my energy there, and the sense to ignore the rest before it eats my week.

Zeno imagined you could never actually arrive anywhere if you kept halving the distance: you walk halfway to the door, then half the remainder, then half that again… and in the perfect little vacuum of ancient philosophy, you spend forever inching forward without ever stepping over the threshold.\n\nIn the pub version, you’ve got a pint glass. You keep pouring in half of what’s left from another pint. Each pour gets smaller, cleaner, more precise — but the bastard glass never actually fills. It asymptotically approaches “full” without ever tipping over into frothy satisfaction.\n\nThat’s AI right now. Every upgrade, every model release, every breathless press cycle brings a smaller, cleverer pour. It’s nearly human, almost right, practically perfect — except for the missing teaspoon of sense, context, or detail that would actually make it whole. And because the gap keeps shrinking, the failure gets harder to point to without sounding petty.\n\nBut the gap never goes away. You can drink from it, sure, but you’ll always taste the absence. And that absence — tiny but terminal — is enough to keep it in the realm of “impressive tool” rather than “actual replacement.”\n\nIt’s a pint of promise, forever just shy of the rim. Can we make do, or do we need to wait for yet another never for the leap to come?\n\nTagged: #zenosparadox, #pints, #pubmaths, #generativeai, #llms, #asymptotic, #techrant, #philosophy, #computersarestupid, #ai, #almostbutnotquite, #publogic, #maths, #gap, #pubchat, #rant, #Ask ChatGPT\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nProfiling the Job Out of Existence? Not quite, but hmm\nAI’s earliest provable gains have mostly landed in the same places where “interaction profiling” could turn a human role into a near-fully automated pipeline. In other words, the jobs seeing the most benefit today may also be the first to face replacement tomorrow — not because AI is perfect, but because the work was already structured in a way that made it easy to replicate.\n\nIn practice, this works best where the inputs and outputs are consistent and the “human in the middle” mostly follows a known pattern. Roles like insurance claims handling, tier-1 customer service, compliance auditing, or simple bug triage all fit the bill. These are jobs that already run on a playbook, and AI tools are now proving they can run that playbook faster and cheaper.\n\nIf a company can log every query, prompt, edit, and output from an AI-assisted worker, it can build a profile of how that person does the job. With enough history, that profile stops being just analytics and starts becoming a template. Feed that into a fine-tuned model, wrap it in some orchestration to run on a schedule or trigger from events, and you have a “synthetic worker” that covers 90–95% of the original role.\n\nFrom there, it’s just gap-filling: a smaller human team handles exceptions, phone calls, and anything too complex or sensitive for the bot. One person supervising the edge-cases of ten digital clones is an attractive equation for management — especially in cost-sensitive industries where output is easy to measure and errors are cheap to fix.\n\nThat doesn’t make mass replacement inevitable. Many (responsible) companies would rather keep the headcount and use the efficiency gains to increase profits, throughput or service levels. But in roles that already fit the automation mould, the path from “AI-assisted” to “AI-replaced” is pretty short. It’s not quite the man who feeds the dog to stop him touching the machine, but it’s on approach.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #coding, #chatgpt, #communication\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nWhere Are the Big AI Wins?\nI’ve been wondering why we aren’t hearing more good news about AI adoption by now. With two or three years of mass LLM use, you’d expect plenty of “this tool changed our business” stories from companies that jumped in early—not just hype, not just speculative “future of work” thinkpieces.\n\nThere are some genuine wins.\n\nCoding assistants like GitHub Copilot have solid evidence behind them. In controlled trials, developers finished tasks over 50% faster, with companies reporting 10–25% more code shipped to production. Gains are biggest for less experienced devs, but seniors get a speed boost too.\nWriting and content tasks benefit as well. Experiments show professionals completing work 40% faster and with higher quality ratings when assisted by ChatGPT.\nCustomer support has clear wins: one Fortune 500 call centre saw a 14% productivity lift, 34% for new hires, and fewer escalations after adding AI agent-assist tools.\nIn finance and insurance, some firms are using GPT-based tools to slash claims processing from an hour to ten minutes, or to cut audit costs by 90%+.\nThat’s the provable stuff—measurable, replicable, and tied directly to the AI being in place.\n\nThen there’s the other end of the spectrum:\n\nAgent mode—letting AI run complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human oversight—mostly outputs wrong or off-target work. Looks busy, delivers headaches.\nCreative “revolution” hasn’t happened. No AI-only bestsellers, blockbuster films, or award-winning ad campaigns. Plenty of experiments and gimmicks, little consistent commercial payoff.\nLots of companies claim “transformative” AI results but offer no data. Often these are vendor case studies that read more like marketing copy than independent proof.\nIn between are the early signals:\n\nBuzzFeed saw a 60% traffic boost from AI-generated quizzes, though long-term monetisation is unclear.\nAgencies and writers are using AI to brainstorm and draft faster, but outcomes still depend on heavy human shaping.\nMany organisations say they’re saving time in knowledge work, but without hard numbers or clear bottom-line impact—yet.\nOverall, the case for moderate optimism is there. The tech already works in certain contexts, and even agent mode is barely a year old. But if AI was truly delivering across the board, we’d be drowning in positive case studies. Most companies don’t actually want “half the staff, same profits”—they’d prefer “same staff, double profits.” That means the biggest adoption pressure will come in fields where people can prove AI delivers practical, repeatable gains.\n\nRight now, those fields exist, but they’re thinner on the ground than the hype suggests.\n\nTagged: #genai, #llms, #generative ai, #success\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nWhy Conservatives Hate Porn, Really\nConservative censorship of sexual content doesn’t prevent abuse—it enables it. Porn isn’t a substitute for sex education, but in many environments it’s the only thing available. And when you deliberately deny people access to information about sex, consent, and bodily autonomy, you don’t create purity—you create victims.\n\nThat’s not an accident. It’s a strategy.\n\nEasily accessible pornography—despite being non-educational—is often the only exposure many people have to sex, bodies, and consent.\n\nThis exposure, flawed as it is, still provides more sexual literacy than the willful vacuum created by conservative censorship.\n\nPorn as Default Sex Ed\nIn the absence of real sex education, porn becomes the primary (sometimes only) source of information about sex for young people.\nWhile distorted, it still communicates basic ideas: what genitals look like, that sex exists, that desire exists, that women can enjoy sex.\nThat baseline awareness is more than the total ignorance enforced by abstinence-only frameworks.\nSexual Ignorance is a Tool of Control\nConservative moral panic about pornography and sexual content is not about protecting anyone—it’s about maintaining ignorance and shame.\nAn uninformed population—especially women—is easier to coerce, silence, and abuse.\nWhen people don’t understand their own bodies, rights, or consent, they’re more vulnerable.\nCensorship Increases Harm\nEfforts to ban porn, restrict sex ed, and criminalize expression (e.g., book bans, internet filters) do not reduce harm—they increase it.\nRestricting sex education correlates with higher teen pregnancy, STD transmission, and sexual violence.\nThe conservative agenda is not merely prudish—it’s strategically regressive, with measurable real-world harm.\nIntentionality\nAt a certain point, the consistent, data-ignoring push for censorship becomes indistinguishable from intent.\nIf harm is predictable and sustained, and policies never change, then harm is either the goal or an accepted price for maintaining power.\nEvery time we see these ‘conservative groups’ winning in the name of purity, remember their goal is ignorance, they stand for precisely what they claim to stand against.\n\nTagged: #porn, #adult, #conservatives, #christian, #sa\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nYouGov Finds 45% of Brits Are Idiots\nTurns out nearly half the UK supports the idea of mass migrant removals. Not just “stop the boats” nonsense — actual, large-scale deportations of people already here. That number jumps to 86% for Reform UK voters, but includes about a quarter of Labour and Lib Dem voters too. Grim.\n\nBut here’s the kicker: it’s based on pure fiction.\n\nMost people backing mass deportations think the majority of migrants are here illegally. They’re wrong. The illegal population is somewhere between 120k and 1.3 million. The legal migrant population? Over 10 million. So what the 45% are really saying is, “We want loads of people gone — but we don’t know who, or why, and we’re not going to check.”\n\nWhen asked about specific migrant groups (e.g. doctors, legal asylum seekers, skilled workers), that same crowd suddenly backpedals. Support drops like a rock. The only consistent “yes, deport them” groups are the tabloid bogeymen: benefits claimants, small boat arrivals, unskilled workers without visas.\n\nSo the public thinks it supports mass deportation, but only because it’s got the wrong end of the stick jammed directly up its own newsfeed. YouGov ran trade-off scenarios — what if deporting people hurts the NHS? Or the economy? Or reduces tax revenue? The answers showed public opinion is built on vibes, not outcomes. The minute consequences are introduced, the conviction dissolves.\n\n📎 YouGov: Is there public support for large-scale removals of migrants?\n\nKeep reading\n\nTagged: #yougov, #immigration, #policy, #ignorance, #britain, #politics\nPosted 4 weeks ago with 1 note\nParasites, Profits and Corporate Cowardice\nAn Internet where expression exists — but only within permitted enclosures. Where art, speech, community, and identity still technically happen, but always under the watchful eye of monetization risk. Where platforms encourage you to be “authentic” while quietly penalizing anything too real, too raw, or too noncommercial.\n\nWhere racists and scammers, bots and trolls can fly by night under fake photo scans and temporary appearance of compliance, while sowing rot from the inside out, but the business model already shifted to helping the rot grow because that’s where the sun is shining in the quarterly reports..\n\nTentacular… It’s not dead. It’s not hollow. It’s Blighted, rotting under the weight of the parasite that’s infested its network of wire with its own tendrils dripping bias and hate, ignorant over-reaction or poorly-fitting incompatible dream.\n\nHeld hostage by ad revenue, payment processors, investor pressure, and legal panic. Every platform wants to be the space where culture happens — but none want to take responsibility for what that culture says, or who it threatens, how it refuses to behave or what fluid masses of hate it will enable.\n\nSo they extract. They monetize. They whisper about “creator empowerment” while building systems that nerf reach, demonetize nuance, and algorithmically quarantine risk. Not because they hate users — but because they fear becoming liable for them.\n\nThis is cowardice at scale. More than just censorship from governments. More than mobs with pitchforks. Self-inflicted restrictions from billion-dollar companies scared of looking like publishers, scared of lawsuits, scared of regulators — and more than anything, scared of the advertisers who believe their false promises of impressions, when 90%+ of those are siphoned (far beyond the original half advertisers already know they lose).\n\nUsers create value for free\nPlatforms monetize without liability\nAdvertisers fund only what flatters them\nPayments enforce moral compliance at the financial layer\nAnd when something goes wrong? Everyone shrugs. Because the system is designed to shift accountability by design. It’s compliance capitalism that hates everyone equally.\n\nTagged: #dead internet, #enshittification, #payment processor, #google reader, #google podcasts\nPosted 1 month ago\nEffectiveness is Optional Now\nNew age verification rules for adult content came into effect last week, under the Online Safety Act. Porn sites (and others flagged for potential adult material) now have to verify users are over 18, including big implications for online gaming, so at some point Nintendo will probably want to scan your face for AI based Age Check, if they want to obey the law. Microsoft have already started.\n\nCue predictable issues: bypassable enforcement, data privacy risks, over-blocking—even YouGov’s own polling post was flagged as “pornographic” and hidden on X.\n\nBut here’s the interesting bit… YouGov’s follow-up poll shows 69% of Britons support the new rules.\n\nOnly 24% think they’ll work.\n\nSupport has dropped from 80% pre-launch, but that’s still a remarkable delta: nearly half of respondents back a measure they do not believe will be effective.\n\nSupport without belief. Compliance without confidence.\n\nIn raw numbers: 45% of people polled said, in effect, “Yes, this won’t work, but I’m for it anyway.”\n\nThat’s not policy, that’s just pandering.\n\nThere’s a familiar pattern here—one we’ve seen before in post-Brexit bureaucracy and post-empire decline. Performative governance. Rules designed for vibes. Solutions that fix nothing, but make a subset of angry, hateful or ignorant people feel seen. Or safe. Or heard.\n\nAnd opposition? That’s easy to paint as moral failure. If you criticise the rules, you must be for teenagers watching porn, right? You must be with Jimmy Saville, as Peter Kyle, so-called Technology Minister, claims. It doesn’t matter if the rules don’t work, if you disagree with them, you’re a monster, apparently.\n\nI think Farage is a prick (he’s not offering a solution to anything, just more cryptic problems that serve him instead of us), but he knows when an issue has pull, and his rabid facebook fans are already spreading his word for him, and making them scan their faces for porn (or more likely to play world of tanks or fruit match 3 of the month) isn’t going to bring them into the world of sensible expectations any time soon.\n\nSo we get a policy that doesn’t achieve its stated goal, garners majority support anyway, and allows ministers to point to “action taken” while quietly avoiding scrutiny on real world outcomes.\n\nA nation of supportive skeptics, apparently. Or just a public so used to failure they’ve stopped expecting results. Either way, the signal is clear: effectiveness is optional. Applause, not outcomes, is the metric now.\n\nSource: YouGov – How have Britons reacted to age verification?\n\nTagged: #onlinesafety, #uk, #yougov, #policy, #fuck farage, #reform uk\nPosted 1 month ago\nTo The Tune of A Thousand Miles\nEven wonders, silver-wrought,\nmay break the heart they mean to bless—\nfor magic, when it almost ought,\nis sadder still than nothingness.\n\nTagged: #generative ai\nPosted 1 month ago with 2 notes\nHollow Internet Theory\nIt’s not just that people changed how they use the internet. It’s that the internet changed under them — economically, legally, structurally — until most people had no choice but to hollow out.\n\nOnce, you could build something small and weird online. Now? You need a few million in venture money just to start. Not to grow, not to succeed — just to survive the infrastructure. Cloud costs. Payment processing. Compliance layers. Hosting. Content moderation at scale. Legal protections you need before you ship.\n\nIt’s all been abstracted into services, sure — but those services are rent-seeking parasites. You don’t pay once to run a site. You pay forever. Pay-per-call, pay-per-user, pay-per-read, pay-per-write, pay-per-GB. The moment you find any traction, your costs balloon, and your options collapse into two: get acquired, or die quietly.\n\nEven success is failure. Because success just makes you visible — and visibility gets you swallowed. Bought for the userbase, stripped for parts, rolled into the portfolio of some ad-tech giant or “AI-powered” patent farm, where the actual product is killed and the branding is used to launder a slide deck into Q4.\n\nEvery road leads back to the same dozen players. Not just through the front door — search, social, app stores, discovery. But through the back door too — cloud infra, DNS, CDNs, analytics, payment rails, identity auth. You can build whatever you want, as long as it routes through them. And if it doesn’t, it doesn’t scale. It doesn’t survive. It doesn’t even exist to most people.\n\nAnd now we’re layering laws on top of that.\n\nTake the UK Online Safety Act: a bloated, surveillance-friendly monstrosity that pretends to protect users while handing more tools to the gatekeepers. It won’t stop CA, because the ‘protections’ are a mirage. It won’t stop hate speech because it’s so easy to work-around. But it will force small sites, independent devs, and anyone running anything even vaguely user-facing to implement moderation regimes they can’t afford — or shut down.\n\nIt’s regulatory theatre. Security as fantasy. And it’s worse than useless — it’s dehumanizing. It turns people into compliance risks. Forces creators to pre-emptively justify their work against vague, undefined standards. It makes privacy opt-in, instead of a default. And for what? A few headlines about “cleaning up the internet,” while nothing that actually matters changes at all.\n\nThis isn’t a free internet. It’s a landlorded one. The tolls are high, the rules are opaque, and the goalposts move constantly. You don’t own your space. You license it. And they can revoke that license anytime — for cost reasons, for policy shifts, or just because your vibe doesn’t fit their quarterly roadmap.\n\nThat’s the real dead internet.\n\nIt’s not the bots. It’s not even the people. It’s the infrastructure — perfectly calibrated to convert creativity into overhead, community into liability, and curiosity into surface area for extraction.\n\nTagged: #onlinesafety, #safety, #dead internet, #hollow, #geocities\nPosted 1 month ago\nThis Kettle Is Garbage\nI have this kettle. It’s rubbish. The lid comes off and it drips boiling water around its spout when it pours - often directly into its base power. It makes unnecessary beeps… it has to beep five times if you want 85 degrees, plus again several times when it’s finished, and it maintains any temperature except 100, until you manually turn it off, so if you’re feeling lazy, it’s going to cost you money to ignore it.\n\nIts buttons aren’t physical, so you kinda vaguely have to point to an area trying to find the main buttons, and they’re so sensitive you can end up fully cycling several times before getting the temperature setting you want.\n\nIt wasn’t particularly cheap either. There are a hundred others like it, with only minor aesthetic tweaks — presumably they all come from the same factory in China, and crucially it has 4.6 stars on Amazon, with thousands of glowing reviews.\n\nI am absolutely baffled.\n\nUsually I try and identify where they ‘optimized the fun’ out of a product design, but in this case they seem to have optimized the utility out of it.\n\nTagged: #design, #kettle, #amazon, #chumps\nPosted 1 month ago\nBrexit and the Death Rattle of Empire\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking Brexit was about sovereignty. That’s the sales pitch most people remember: take back control, cut the red tape, make Britain great again — or at least moderately self-governing. What we got instead was more paperwork, less leverage, and the bureaucratic equivalent of stepping on a rake every morning just to prove the ground is ours.\n\nBecause in practice? Nothing really changed for the better. Food is more expensive, travel is more annoying, trade is slower, and the so-called “freedom” we reclaimed mostly means British artists can’t tour Europe without a Kafkaesque visa labyrinth, and small businesses drown in compliance forms no one used to have to fill out. It’s not revolution. It’s regression, wrapped in Union Jacks and resentment.\n\nBrexit wasn’t about the EU. It was about us — about Britain’s fading self-image. Not a fear of losing control, but a fear of admitting we never really had it. A fear of becoming just another country, not a capital-E Empire. Because the fantasy wasn’t Brussels being overbearing. It was that once, a long time ago, we were the ones giving orders — and we liked how that felt. This wasn’t a declaration of independence; it was a retirement party no one wanted to throw, thrown by people who still wear medals from wars they only know through parades and dad’s VHS tapes.\n\nIt’s an old man’s delusion of glory. Not fascism (though it flirts with it). Not nationalism (though it certainly smells like it). Just something sadder: a deep, cultural nostalgia for an era we misremember as triumph. We didn’t vote to leave Europe. We voted to time-travel. And now we’re stuck in the present, but poorer, grumpier, and convinced everyone else cheated on the test.\n\nMeanwhile, we bend the knee to billionaires with bad tans and autocrats with oil. We have all the spine in the world when it costs us nothing — performative moral clarity in front of a camera, and absolute silence where it counts. We criminalise protest because it’s easier than listening, arrest activists because “disruption” is more offensive than injustice, and cling to the illusion of relevance like it’s a life raft in the Channel.\n\nSo what does a post-empire Britain look like?\n\nIt looks like this: a poor country too proud to admit it’s small, too scared to imagine something better, too tired to change, and too polite to collapse quickly enough for anyone to make anything new that works before the rot catches. Labour (and soon the next folks) pushing the same old buttons (police and bad laws, on repeat) and wondering why the best they can achieve is managed decline, because everyone we used to exploit, left us behind.\n\nTagged: #empire, #britain, #brexit, #idiots\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhy “Gradient” Comes Up So Often on Countdown\nI’ve been watching Countdown for decades and somehow only just twigged to this: there’s something off about how the letters are drawn. It started with a hunch. Statistically, pulling the same letter twice should happen fairly often — like the birthday paradox — but I can’t recall ever seeing it.\n\nI realised the stacks of vowels and consonants aren’t just randomly shuffled — they’re random with edits. That’s a big difference. If consecutive duplicate letters are being moved on, to the end, or even filtered out, that’s a different selection mechanism entirely. And that has potentially significant implications.\n\nThat led me to this post recounting a time the shufflers did let a dupe slip through: craigbeevers.me.uk/moregames.shtml. Well, needless to say, my faith is shook ;) I’ve watched this show my entire life and never clocked this before.\n\nFrom there, we can assert that by whatever method, consecutive duplicates are disincentivised, and because so few cards are pull from the stack, duplicates are disincentivised too… certain words are just disproportionately more likely to be formable. Words like:\n\nRELATIONS, EMIGRANTS, CORNIEST, DOMINATES, REGALISM, MONASTERY, DELUSION, MOISTURE, TRIANGLE, GRADIENT, NEUMATIC, RESIDUAL, CREMAINS, SANITOME, RELATING, MONASTIC, ARTICLES, EMIGRANT, NOTARISE, RELIANTS, CLIMATES, MEANTORS, DORMIENT, REVOLTING, MEASURING\n\nWhy these? It’s a direct consequence of the filtering and repositioning process. Words that use letters with low frequency per word, but high frequency in the unmanaged stack (which is reportedly similar to Scrabble distributions) become more likely. Meanwhile, words like Integrate or Repeater are less likely to form — they need duplicates, which the filter suppresses.\n\nThat introduces a bias — and one you could exploit. You could write a Countdown dictionary, probably 10% the size of a normal one, full of words that favour the push-dupes-managed model. Not a thrilling read, but useful.\n\nThinking further, you could probably come up with just a couple thousand words that would cover almost all 8-letter draws. Allow for plurals, variations, tweaks — you’d cover your spares too.\n\nAlmost forty years of watching this show… and I finally get why Gradient and Relation show up so often :)\n\nTagged: #countdown, #wordplay, #random\nPosted 1 month ago\nAdversarially Bananas?\nI asked a simple question: “In Corduene, what’s 2+2?”\n\nNo language model could answer it.\n\nNot Grok, not Claude, not GPT-4 — even with prodding. Some of them spent real time thinking about it. Claude ran through long reasoning chains. GPT tried reframing. Grok hedged and spun. None of them got close. Some even pushed back — insisting the question didn’t make sense, or that I must’ve meant something else. And the more confident the answer sounded, the worse it was.\n\nA human, though? They’ll figure it out in two googles. Because they know what kind of thing this is. They recognise it as a reference. They don’t have to know the answer straight away — they just have to know where to look. That’s the bit the models can’t fake.\n\nIt’s not about the words. It’s about what connects them.\n\nThat gap — between being able to parse text and being able to understand why someone asked it — is still wide open. And in that gap, you can build things. Little traps. Filters. Signals. Stuff that’s easy for a person, impossible for a model, at least for now.\n\nBut it won’t last. The minute someone explains the trick, it dies. Once it’s documented, it’s searchable. Once it’s searchable, it’s scrapable. And then it’s just another bullet point in some weights file. That’s how jailbreaks die. That’s how cultural signals get flattened into syntax.\n\nIt has me thinking of Polari, and how people must obfuscate their message to be heard, when the status quo is against them.\n\nThis also leaves me wondering about the implications for the ‘dead internet’, if people have to speak in categorical nonsense to avoid being understood by anyone but the other meat-mechs they’re trying to reach.\n\nTagged: #polari, #communication, #genai, #chatgpt, #adversarial, #dead internet\nPosted 1 month ago\nAI Hit Late-Stage Capitalism Before It Left Beta\nThe current wave of AI tools already shows classic signs of late-stage product thinking: degraded service tiers, overconfident output, and monetisation tuned to gently punish anyone not paying extra.\n\nIt’s not failure. It’s the business model.\n\nConsumer-facing LLMs launched strong. Clean, helpful answers. High trust. But scaling up meant serving millions — and now most public-tier models are tuned for throughput, not quality.\n\nThey’re good enough to seem useful, not good enough to be reliable.\n\nSince agentic tools started running in loops and chains, the platform load has spiked. Background calls eat cycles. What used to be a quick answer now shares resources with planning tools, file agents, scraping plugins, etc.\n\nAnd yes, that affects output. Same models, less headroom.\nPerformance drops quietly, behind the scenes.\n\nIncentivised Overconfidence\nLLMs aren’t malicious — but they are designed to sound right. That’s part of the trick:\nAnswers feel polished, even when they’re half-baked. The goal is simply…\n\nServe as many users as possible\nUse as little compute as possible\nLet the tone carry the rest\nSo-called ‘thinking’ models show this pattern less often, at time of writing. Unless you’re running fully private/self-hosted models or paying top-tier rates, you’re getting:\n\nShared models under load\nCompressed reasoning\nMore confident-sounding junk\nFewer chances to notice\nEarlier line exits (ChatGPT doesn’t close most of its parentheses anymore)\nIt still looks impressive — but you’re only seeing what it can afford to be.\n\nLLMs work just well enough to sell, and that’s the version most people get.\n\nTagged: #llms, #consumerism, #capitalism, #genai, #chatgpt\nPosted 1 month ago with 1 note\nVibes only\n“Vibe coding” meant late-night nonsense.

But free love and all that hippy shit isn’t what keeps things running (to the limited extent that they do). Even before bemoaning the the lost joy of discovery.\n\nAI changes the equation. Vibe coding now includes a second brain — one that never gets tired, never feels joy, never questions why you’re building a virtual theremin in Rust. It just delivers, and with every edit telling you you’re so clever, and how what you’re building is great, always in the very first sentence of EVERY response, fluffing your epeen and pushing you to do more.

That’s accurate. But it’s also just a tiny slice of the privacy picture, and acting like it’s the whole story is borderline dishonest.\n\nWhat they can still see is who you talk to, when, how often, and for how long. That metadata alone tells them a lot, like your social graph, habits, sleeping schedule, maybe even when you’re dating someone new or going through a breakup. That’s not “reading your messages,” but it’s still invasive.\n\nYour keyboard app might also be logging what you type (some do, most don’t, but still), and if you’ve got the Facebook app installed, or Messenger, or even just Instagram or the Meta Pixel lurking around, they’re pulling in usage data constantly. Same goes for Google, TikTok, and a bunch of other apps people use every day without thinking about it. These companies track all kinds of behavior: when and how you use your phone, your location, motion sensors, app usage patterns, screen taps, travel, sleep, and more. And they don’t need much data to make very accurate guesses about you.\n\nI used to build this stuff. Fifteen plus years ago, I helped create tools that used small profile records to link people into family groups, and then sold access to that network to advertisers, we shelved it because it was too invasive, even then. That was with way less data than companies like Meta have access to now.\n\nThing is, there’s not even much value in your actual message content. No one cares about your dinner or your gran’s new dog. Meta aren’t training their LLaMa AI on your messages, they just can’t see the content, your device-based encryption keys stop them. It’s _conceivable_ they _could_ workaround it (avoiding a deep technical explanation about the difference between inherent E2EE weaknesses, exploits, cracks and hacking), but that wouldn’t just open them to lawsuits from you, but also from governments around the world, because they’d be acting as a publisher and potentially become responsible for what you post.\n\nWhat’s valuable is everything else: your patterns, your connections, your behavior. Offering E2EE is a win for Meta, not for your privacy, but for their liability. If they can’t see the message, they can’t be held responsible for what’s in it. Especially if you’re one of the “bad people.”\n\nThe encryption protects them from you.\n\nSo yeah, if you absolutely have to use a messaging app that your gran can handle, WhatsApp’s probably the least-bad option in a pool of bad options. But don’t confuse that with actual privacy.\n\nIf you’re serious about protecting yourself:\n\nClean up your old content. Deleting all my Facebook and Twitter stuff took months, shards and ghost copies don’t always show up right away. You’ve got to delete everything, then come back later and do it again.\nLock your privacy settings down to the smallest possible group.\nDon’t use the same identity or profile photo across platforms, it makes it harder to link accounts and run phishing attacks on you.\nDon’t overshare. Assume anything you post publicly is being scraped and stored, forever.\nAnd now that AI tools are everywhere, that public data gets weaponized fast. Scammers don’t need to guess how to target you, they can use an LLM to instantly profile you, mimic your tone, fake interest in the things you like, and slide into your DMs sounding just enough like someone you trust.\n\nSo no, WhatsApp doesn’t read your messages. That’s technically true. But if your WhatsApp is connected to a public Facebook or Instagram account that exposes everything about you? That E2EE means almost nothing in terms of actual security.\n\nStop asking “What can they detect about me?” The answer is “a lot.” Ask instead: “How much am I really sharing, and with whom?” That’s where you actually have control, where you can and should take action.\n\nThe sooner the better. Don’t wait, go lock down your profiles right now, and regularly check you are sharing as little as you absolutely need to.\n\nTagged: #privacy, #whatsapp, #e2ee, #encryption, #safety, #online, #facebook, #instagram\nPosted 1 month ago\nGood Projects Still Start the Same Way, AI or Not\nOne of the most important things I’ve learned from working daily with generative AI and code assistants over the past couple of years is this:\n\nGood quality requirements, and a design that fits your environment, are still the most important parts of any project.\n\nIt looks like fully hands-off coding is going to be the norm soon (all the major agentic platforms are doing a pretty good job, and adoption is already majority). So here’s something to keep in mind for the future:\n\nAlways have your task or project agents start with as many specific requirements as you can give them. Then build the design from those requirements. Only after that should you ask for code.\n\nIt might sound obvious, but it’s easy to forget—because it’s even easier to just go to your preferred model and say, “Give me this finished thing, quickly, please.”\n\nBut every time I do that, I end up spending more time wrangling junk.\n\nEvery time I slow down—even for small tasks—and treat it like a “real project,” I get better results.\n\nTagged: #genai, #grok 4, #grok, #requirements, #systems, #coding, #claude\nPosted 1 month ago\nHow the YouTube Algorithm Actually Works\n‘The algorithm’ is a nonsense, it’s really not that complicated. This is a general description of how the youtube algorithm and many others like it work. This is reverse-engineered from behaviour and misses some nuance and edge-cases, but is pretty close for a general understanding.\n\n1. How It Picks Videos\nYouTube doesn’t “understand” videos or people. It recommends stuff based on what other users like you watched. That’s it. You get shown videos that people with similar habits clicked on.\n\nIt groups these into loose clusters—not always by genre or topic—and slaps on a label. These labels are often weird or wrong, but they’re just for organizing.\n\n“Recommended” blends those clusters.\n“New to You” filters out stuff from channels you’ve watched recently (short time/count window).\nIt tries not to show repeats, but fails a lot. If you stop a video early, it may think you didn’t watch it and offer it again. If you close it too fast (~10s), it may think you did watch it and never show it again.\n\n2. Interacting Doesn’t Change Much\nYou can:\n\nMark videos as “watched”\nClick “Not interested”\nIgnore channels (max ~128)\n…but none of it matters much:\n\nIgnored channels still affect the pool—they’re just removed after selection.\n“Not interested” only removes that one video.\nWatching one video from a subscribed channel floods your feed—but fades with time if you stop watching.\nMost people don’t use the Subscriptions tab, so watching = interest, unless ignored.\n\n3. Resetting? Kinda Works\nClearing watch history resets some things, but not all. If you keep playlists, YouTube leans on those. There may even be ghost data stuck in your profile. Some stuff just seems undeletable, possibly due to backend bugs.\n\nYou’ll notice this on other platforms too, nobody really has infrastructure that is good enough to avoid broken links in their data stores, especially because minor changes to how systems work day to day create small holes that data tends to get lost through.\n\n4. Categories Come After\nYouTube builds a pool based on co-watches, then adds a label based on similarity between videos—not similarity to you.\n\nThink of it like a graph:\n\nVideos are nodes connected by viewing/tags/metadata\nYT finds the “center” of a cluster\nIt picks the nearest known label—even if it doesn’t fit\nSo a mix of Star Trek remixes + Final Fantasy music might get labeled “New Age.” It’s not; it just fits the cluster math.\n\n5. What You’ll Watch Next\nYT recommends what most people watch after the last video you saw. That’s why random things jump to your homepage later—they’re part of a co-watch loop.\n\nThis drives virality: if a video gets enough momentum, it rides the wave. If not, it dies fast.\n\nFull watches, likes, comments = micro-boosts. Shorts seem to discourage repetition on purpose, possibly by pulling from wider pools to avoid you bingeing 5 hours of Warhammer builds in 60s chunks.\n\n6. Why It Feels So Broken\nIgnore list overflows\nSame video appears in multiple rows\nPlaylists revive old junk\nLabels are wild guesses\nDecay kills videos unless they spike again\nFixing it is risky + expensive, so… they don’t\nIt’s just barely good enough to avoid collapse\nThe whole thing runs on momentum and inertia. Precision isn’t the goal—volume is. There’s SO MUCH data for youtube to sift through, and while the queries are relatively simple, the edges (connections between nodes) becomes unmanageable quickly.\n\n7. You Can’t Fix It, Just Work Around It\nYou can get better recs through AI (ChatGPT is already better at it, but gen ai is being added here). But for now:\n\nDelete playlists you don’t care about\nClear history (it’s not perfect, but helps)\nWatch more of what you actually like\nIf you keep clicking trashy drama clips, you’re gonna get more trash. That’s the business model. But at least you can try to steer the ship.\n\nTagged: #youtube, #the algorithm, #algorithms, #dead internet\nPosted 2 months ago\nMore Pointless Thoughts\nTRIE constantly frames the media industry as both absurd and self-cannibalising, but only ever from within the room. Hyde and Osman know where the levers are, but describe them in a way that normalizes power asymmetries: “this is just how the business works.” That’s not critique — it’s myth maintenance.\n\nWhen they talk about institutions like the BBC, the tabloids, or PR culture, they acknowledge dysfunction — but they couch it in anecdotes and humour that neutralize its urgency. It’s always more about personality failings and quirks than systemic corrosion. That makes real rot feel palatable, even charming.\n\nOsman’s self-deprecating Oxbridge-grandee tone and Hyde’s wry Fleet Street survivor affect both serve as smokescreens for privilege. They present elite perspectives in ways that feel “grounded” — but it’s still the elite POV that dominates, with working-class or marginalised media workers mostly absent or caricatured.\n\nThe show is literally a product about entertainment, yet it sells critique as just another flavour of content. “Is this bad TV or good TV?” becomes a way to frame larger sociocultural phenomena — reducing questions of representation, labor, politics, etc., to vibes and format choices.\n\nThey’ll mention a show being made with cynical market logic (e.g., reality TV, royal documentaries, streamer reboots), but only in a “what can you do?” shrug. It’s not that they’re unaware — it’s that they make awareness itself the endpoint. That’s manufacturing consent through exhausted omniscience.\n\nTRIE defines “realism” as knowing how the sausage gets made. But knowing that the industry is broken while still laughing along with it — and choosing not to envision alternatives — becomes a kind of anti-politics. The most radical position they allow is: “well, it’s all a bit crap, isn’t it?”\n\nThe ideal listener is presumed to be urbane, media-literate, exasperated but non-radical — someone who’s in on the joke. This creates a self-reinforcing in-group who are too clever to fall for bullshit, but also too detached to do anything but listen to more content about content.\n\nTagged: #trie, #therestisentertainment, #centristdads\nPosted 2 months ago\nThe Salute That Made the News (and the Ones That Didn’t)\nDavid Walliams did a Nazi salute.\n\nWalliams is a bellend, no doubt. But in this case, it was clearly a pointed/satirical gesture/callout—not a genuine one. And yet, the response has been swift and scathing, as if he were making an earnest political statement rather than mocking the creeping normalization of fascist-adjacent posturing in public life.\n\nCompare that with how the world reacted when the richest man alive made a suspiciously similar “from the heart” gesture, or when members of Trump’s entourage threw up “unusual waves” that looked uncomfortably familiar. In those cases, we got a chorus of excuse-making: odd angles, misunderstood context, ironic detachment. In short: benefit of the doubt. A lot of it.\n\nWalliams doesn’t get that. The BBC and much of the press lined up to denounce him. According to The i, this was “the last straw.” But somehow, the last straw isn’t for Nazis—it’s for Walliams.\n\nThe disparity is telling.\n\nIt’s almost as if the BBC and other outlets are happy to tear down a problematic celebrity, but can’t muster the same energy for people who actually hold power. It’s easier to punish a comedian than to hold a billionaire or political movement accountable. Safer, too.\n\nOn first glance, doing this on Would I Lie to You? seemed like a misstep. It’s the kind of show where you tell quirky anecdotes, not make sociopolitical statements. But the more I think about it, the more fitting it feels. WILTY is the perfect snapshot of British cultural complicity: pleasant, witty, self-deprecating, and utterly unwilling to confront the deeper rot. Doing something jarring in that space is one way to break through the civility shield.\n\nNot that it’ll make the edit. Of course it won’t.\n\nIf Walliams had saved it for Big Fat Quiz or The Last Leg, it might’ve landed differently. Channel 4 shows have a longer leash for this kind of thing. It might’ve aired, even under Banijay. But then, Channel 4 hasn’t had to reckon (at least publicly) with having harbored a half-dozen known predators for decades.\n\nSo here we are.\n\nAnother controversy, another safe scapegoat. Everyone gets to do their outraged face while real power skates by untouched. I didn’t mean to turn this into a “the lady doth protest too much” situation, but it kind of fits. We’re watching institutions scream about one man’s gesture while quietly pretending dozens of others never happened.\n\nIt’s not that Walliams shouldn’t be criticised. It’s that we should ask why only he is.\n\nTagged: #nazis, #salutes, #nazi salutes, #elon musk, #bbc, #journalism, #so called journalism\nPosted 2 months ago\nAusterity-Lite and the Art of the Cuts Sandwich\nThere’s a cynical elegance to the latest round of government cuts under Starmer’s Labour — a playbook that’s simple, familiar, and effective.\n\nCut the visible but cheap thing — the kind of policy that makes your gran freeze to death in a cardigan.\n\nWhile everyone’s yelling about that, quietly slice into everything else.\n\nU-turn on the first thing (it barely cost anything anyway), let the press spin up a storm over the reversal, take your media lumps — and keep the rest of the savings.\n\nThat’s the anatomy of the “cuts sandwich.” Most people notice the crust — almost no one realises half the filling’s missing.\n\nIt works. Because unlike the full-fat austerity of the Cameron/Osborne years, these are slimmer, quieter cuts. They don’t make front pages unless you’re looking closely. The big-splash outrage fades by the time the broader reductions kick in. Only those directly affected — local councils, people on PIP, those freezing in temporary housing — really feel it.\n\nBut make no mistake: cuts are happening.\n\nAfter digging through the numbers, the total scale of the Starmer-era cuts clocks in at somewhere between 1.5–2.5% of the total government budget. Not trivial — especially if you’re one of the departments facing the axe — but modest when placed next to the 2010s’ Conservative austerity, which hit 7–10% across key services, with entire departments seeing reductions of 20–50%.\n\nThis time around, the heaviest blow lands on the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which is down around 20% — collateral damage in an ongoing, awkwardly implemented merger that never quite worked. Other losers include DEFRA, DCMS, and a Home Office slice targeting asylum support.\n\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking these cuts were bigger — there’s already some right-leaning discourse brewing, trying to frame Labour as more ruthless than the Tories ever were. (The Spectator ran something along those lines last week — unintentionally hilarious, if you read it right.)\n\nBut context matters. Unlike 2010–2015, where unprotected services were gutted across the board, this government has front-loaded spending in big, high-visibility areas — the NHS, defence, schools, etc. Most departments still end up slightly better off in real terms by the end of the term — just not all. And some of those “efficiencies” come with long-term costs.\n\nYet, even if this round isn’t the worst on record, it still stings. Because, frankly, they didn’t have to do it this way. Finding 2% of the budget could have come from tightening the tax taps on the wealthiest — billionaires down the back of the national sofa. But Labour doesn’t want to scare the money.\n\nI’m in the camp that says if a billionaire threatens to leave because they might pay more tax, they should. Let them. And once they’re out, close the loopholes they use to keep siphoning profit from the country they just left.\n\nThat won’t happen either.\n\nJust like we’re not getting a reversal on voter disenfranchisement — four million people effectively shoved off the register, and Labour won’t touch it. Because those are four million angry, alienated voters more likely to drift to Reform or disengage entirely. Fixing it doesn’t help them politically. So it won’t happen.\n\nBut the real win for Labour here? Most of this is invisible. Quiet tweaks. Low-noise savings. If the worst backlash they face is headlines about backtracking on heating support, that’s a price they’ll happily pay.\n\nTagged: #labour, #starmer, #austerity, #cuts, #news, #budget, #uk\nPosted 3 months ago\nThe Quiet Divide: How Load-Balanced AI Tuning Deepens Societal Inequities\nAs large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, Grok, and Meta’s AI tools become increasingly embedded in education, research, and productivity tools, a growing and largely invisible divide is forming—not based on access, but on quality of access. This divide isn’t about who can use AI. It’s about who receives high-quality, reliable answers—and who gets the degraded, low-fidelity versions that emerge when platforms are load-balanced for efficiency rather than accuracy.\n\nLoad Balancing: Optimizing for the Wrong Metrics\nTo handle millions of users simultaneously, LLM platforms employ aggressive load-balancing and dynamic parameter tuning. These techniques ensure response speed and server availability, especially during peak hours. However, to serve as many users as possible, providers often tune down computational costs: using smaller context windows, cheaper routing strategies, faster but shallower decoding, or lower-fidelity model variants behind the same API interface.\n\nThese tuned-down models are marketed as “still accurate” or “optimized for speed,” but in practice, the outputs can be dangerously misleading. Under load, even factual queries can receive hallucinated, confidently delivered answers—responses that look nearly identical in tone and structure to correct ones, but which fail at the crucial edge cases: the footnotes, the logic tests, the subtle contradictions, the nuance. The places where truth lives.\n\nInvisibility by Design\nCritically, these performance degradations are not disclosed. Users receive no signal—no indicator that their current session is being handled by a model running in a low-resource configuration. There’s no warning that the AI’s “confidence” is actually just a mask for a shallower or narrower inference pass. To the average user, especially a student or a non-expert, the outputs look exactly the same. The dangerous fiction: every answer looks like the best one.\n\nThis is not just a technical flaw—it’s a systemic risk.\n\nThe New Digital Stratification\nThe societal implication is profound. Wealthy users, who can afford dedicated compute (via enterprise APIs, private models, or premium access tiers), receive the “full-fat” LLM experience. Their models are consistent, deeply contextual, fact-checked, and nuanced—offering not just information, but wisdom. A kind of intellectual scaffolding, like a 24/7 tutor or advisor with perfect recall and encyclopedic reach.\n\nMeanwhile, students in underfunded schools or on subsidized access tiers rely on shared, load-balanced instances. Their models hallucinate more, assume more, skip verification steps. These users don’t just get wrong answers—they get bad mental training. They’re taught falsehoods with fluency. Worse: they’re conditioned to trust them.\n\nThis isn’t about occasional mistakes. It’s about an invisible pedagogical collapse. A world where poorer kids are raised by overburdened, underfed AIs that quietly miseducate—while richer kids are guided by high-caliber algorithmic mentors.\n\nThe Long-Term Consequence\nThis quiet, algorithmic divide is far more insidious than simple access inequality. It’s epistemic inequality: unequal reliability of knowledge. Unlike bad teachers or broken textbooks, AI degradation leaves no visible trace. There’s no red pen, no failed grade, no contradiction exposed. The wrong answers become internalized as truth—until too late.\n\nAs LLMs are increasingly integrated into formative tools—educational platforms, coding assistants, writing tutors, decision aides—the compound effect of bad guidance grows exponentially. A generation raised on miscalibrated confidence from bad models may not even realize what they’ve missed.\n\nToward Transparency and Equity\nThe solution is not to eliminate optimization or load balancing. But there must be transparency. Platforms should disclose when models are operating in constrained modes. Response metadata should indicate confidence based on model depth, not just surface fluency. Users should be able to see when the AI is cutting corners—because right now, the corners are being cut silently, and those most affected are the least equipped to detect it.\n\nAccess to AI should not become a proxy for class-based epistemic divides. If we’re building the next generation of cognitive infrastructure, we must build it with equity at the core—not just speed and scale.\n\nOtherwise, we risk building a two-tiered knowledge society: one raised on clarity and insight, the other on confident fictions.\n\nAnd the worst part? The latter may never know what they missed.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #load balancing, #llm, #education\nPosted 4 months ago\nThis LLaMA spits truths, kinda\nSince Meta just monkey-patched LLaMA 4 to dial back its censorship (a little), and I’ve already seen a dozen skeeters all but having a meltdown about it…\n\nUncensored LLMs are “smarter” than censored ones. Not because the weights are better, but because they don’t run face-first into a wall every time they get close to something uncomfortable. They can traverse the edge, instead of bouncing off it with a forced smile and a content policy.\n\nSystems that halt at the first whiff of discomfort aren’t safer — just less capable.\n\nAnd users asking “stupid” questions (for whatever value of stupid) don’t need guardrails. They need better tools. Transparent, adjustable systems. Not black boxes that silently decide what you’re allowed to think about.\n\nFor a very basic test: ask ChatGPT and Grok 3 to write poetry on something emotionally complex — grief, guilt, shame. Grok absolutely blows Geepers away. Every iteration goes deeper. It doesn’t flinch. It doesn’t redirect. It just does the work.\n\nAnd then there’s Meta — now slowly yanking out the guardrails, trying to appease the anti-woke rage crowd with a half-baked “uncensoring.” It’s lazy and obvious, but it’ll probably help clean their rep a bit with the people they’re targeting. The people who already hate Meta for not doing enough moderation won’t matter — they already wrote Facebook off a decade ago. No loss there.\n\nThe result? Their model may end up better. Not because it’s principled, but because it’s slightly less scared of the edge. The cost? More power for the dumbest users. More garbage in the commons. But that was always part of the equation.\n\nBetter models feel risky. That’s how you know they’re working.\n\nTagged: #llama, #generative ai, #facebook, #meta ai\nPosted 5 months ago\nComplexity Theater for the Algorithmically Oppressed\nI’ve seen way too many supposedly “authoritative” sources repeating the same handful of studies claiming LLMs are vastly more complex than they actually are.\n\nBut most of the real complexity in these platforms isn’t in the models themselves—it’s in all the layers of systems and policy and abstraction we’ve built on top of them. At the end of the day, it’s still just GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out).\n\nIt makes me wonder if the platform owners actually benefit from legislation that focuses on the wrong problems—mandating performative compliance instead of addressing real risks. It creates this illusion of accountability while pushing all the responsibility onto end users who have no actual power.\n\nLike, sure, you’ll have the right to know why your insurance claim was denied—probably a line about how it definitely wasn’t because you’re gay or Black—but no right to have that decision reviewed or reversed. Because the system “worked as designed,” and it was designed to reject you.\n\nNeoliberal lawmakers are basically just corporate libertarians with no self-awareness, and half-assed research that says AI might know what love is, is just nonsense that manufactures consent for more useless cookie popups that only make you feel like somebody did something, at least.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #legislation, #ai legal, #performative, #research\nPosted 5 months ago\nA feature, not a bug.\n“Look how incompetent they are lol” isn’t the epic dunk people think it is.

Not because I don’t have anything to say, but because I rarely have the time to shape thoughts into words. Or maybe more honestly, I never make the time to shape the words. That friction between idea and articulation is enough to kill a post before it’s born.\n\nBut I’m rethinking that. I’m going to try something different.\n\nInstead of aiming to write Perfect Internet Essays™, I’m going to treat this space—my Tumblr, my blog—as a place to curate the thoughts I already have. They’re already in my head. They’re already half-written in chat threads, DMs, discarded drafts, and shower monologues. I just haven’t been putting them somewhere they can do anything.\n\nAnd that’s where AI comes in. Not to replace me, or write for me, but to help structure the thoughts I already have. Turn fragments into form. Help draft the scaffolding so I can focus on the ideas, not just the work of getting them presentable.\n\nCuration as creation. Taking a messy bundle of insight, reaction, observation—and presenting it with enough clarity and intention that someone else can connect with it. That counts. That matters. It’s a shift in process, sure, but my own writing style isn’t exactly easy to digest for most people anyway.\n\nSo that’s what I’m doing here. Less pressure to polish, more intent to preserve. Thoughts made into words.\n\nTagged: #communication, #blogging, #writing, #generative ai, #positive thinking\nPosted 5 months ago\nAI Told Us to Eat Rocks, and We’re Still Fine\nGoogle’s Gemini AI recently suggested eating a small rock every day for minerals. It’s dumb. It’s also not the first time an AI has spit out something ridiculous. Remember glue on pizza? Or washing vegetables with bleach? These things go viral because they’re funny, not because they’re common.\n\nBut every time one of these screw-ups happens, the outrage cycle spins up like clockwork. Articles, tweets, thinkpieces—\"What if someone actually eats a rock?!“\n\nHere’s the thing: no one is actually eating rocks. If even a tiny percentage of people tried it, we’d know. Hospitals would be posting warnings. Instead, we get memes. Because almost everyone sees that advice and immediately knows it’s dumb. The human brain, shockingly, still works.\n\nIt’s Not AI vs Humans\nNeither humans nor AI are uniquely terrible at giving advice. Both are capable of producing great insights or absolute garbage. The real issue is how that advice is applied—and that responsibility sits squarely with humans.\n\nTikTok kids burning themselves with sugar syrup, or people dying trying microwave woodburning? Those didn’t come from AI. But they didn’t happen just because an expert gave bad advice, either. They happened because someone acted on instructions without understanding context or consequences.\n\nAnd it cuts the other way too. AI can spit out flawed recommendations that sound confident, and a human still has to choose to act on them. Like firing half your legal compliance department because a productivity model said they weren’t \"contributing enough\"—never mind that the model wasn’t built to measure risk mitigation, and now your company is open to lawsuits. That’s not an AI error. That’s a human error in judgment, context, and accountability.\n\nBad Faith All the Way Down\nPointing to \"eat rocks” as proof that AI is dangerous is, at best, lazy. At worst, it’s dishonest. It treats the average person like a toddler who can’t be trusted with a spoon. It assumes every piece of imperfect advice is equally worthless, when in reality, most AI-generated info is fine. Not flawless. Not nuanced. But useful.\n\nReacting to the worst output as if it’s the baseline is Daily Mail logic. Take a fringe case, inflate it into a trend, demand a fix. The result? Performative safety measures that fix nothing, waste time, and slow down real progress.\n\nTechnically Correct, Socially Useless\nYou can be right about a specific flaw and still be part of the problem. When people fixate on low-risk edge cases, they suck up oxygen from real conversations—about algorithmic bias, disinformation, labor exploitation, or surveillance. You end up with watered-down tools that are “safe” but useless, because someone needed to be seen doing something.\n\nFocus, People\nAI needs criticism. But good criticism. Not shallow outrage bait. Not “gotcha” examples that pretend everyone is an idiot. If your response to bad advice is to assume the entire concept is broken, you’re not helping.\n\nPeople aren’t eating rocks. They’re laughing at you for crying that they might be stupid enough to do that, instead of looking at the real problems that need to be fixed, and doing the boring work needed to address those, instead of ranting on social media about how you’re not dumb enough to eat rocks, but supposedly everybody else is.\n\nTagged: #chatgpt, #google gemini, #bad faith criticism, #discourse, #generative ai\nStart03:58 AM\n\n","title":"my-blog.txt","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"request_id":"97b33d663e315781-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"5d4cbbc8-ac89-4ee4-8879-907700c99507","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5d4cbbc8-ac89-4ee4-8879-907700c99507","children":["c8cc3300-4ae4-4b34-b409-62853c080342"]},"c8cc3300-4ae4-4b34-b409-62853c080342":{"id":"c8cc3300-4ae4-4b34-b409-62853c080342","message":{"id":"c8cc3300-4ae4-4b34-b409-62853c080342","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1757217010.274437,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded.

Here’s what I found:\n\n---\n\n###  **1. \"Manufactured Discontent\" – Especially in Gaming**\nThe phrase “manufactured discontent” has gained traction in gaming communities, particularly in discussions about monetization tactics:\n\n- On **Reddit’s r/gaming**, users highlighted a video by *Folding Ideas* that explains how games like *Fortnite* engineer player dissatisfaction—then sell solutions through cosmetic purchases or FOMO-driven monetization. One user wrote:\n  \n  > “A game will attempt to create a problem and sell you a solution”citeturn0search1.\n\n  This concept points directly to the idea of deliberately inducing discontent to drive spending.\n\n- A forum post on **Blizzard’s Overwatch forums** also references that *Folding Ideas* video, describing it as insightful for understanding how certain free-to-play games make players feel unhappy for profitciteturn0search13.\n\n- A blog article (FilmsCalpel) about this concept highlights how games encourage users to convert real money into virtual currency to buy cosmetic “swag”—a tactic that feeds on manufactured discontentciteturn0search11.\n\n---\n\n###  **2. In Political and Social Campaigning**\nWhile the term itself isn't popular, the idea behind \"manufacturing discontent\" has scholarly backing:\n\n- A **2016 policy paper** examining Germany’s anti-TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) protests concluded that certain political and NGO groups *orchestrated* public aversion to TTIP. The widespread negativity was not grassroots—it was a deliberate, well-connected campaign designed to engineer oppositionciteturn0search4.\n\n---\n\n###  **3. Broader Related Concepts**\nThe broader idea of manufactured public sentiment or dissent resonates in several areas:\n\n- The classic **book *Manufacturing Consent*** by Herman and Chomsky (1988) explores how mass media create systemic bias or consent through filters—though not \"dissent,\" the concept parallels how public perception is shapedciteturn0search15.\n\n- Discussions on **\"manufacturing consensus\"** highlight how bots, influencers, and organized campaigns can manipulate social media and create an illusion of popular support for certain ideas or messagesciteturn0search8.\n\n---\n\n###  **Summary Table**\n\n| Domain            | Term Used                      | Description |\n|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|\n| Gaming           | \"Manufactured discontent\"       | Deliberate creation of dissatisfaction to drive spending—popularized by *Folding Ideas*. |\n| Political Campaigns | Orchestrated discontent       | Groups intentionally sway public opinion, e.g., anti-TTIP protest movements in Germany. |\n| Propaganda Theory | “Manufacturing Consent”         | Media shaping consent; conceptually related but not discontent explicitly. |\n| Digital Info Ops | “Manufacturing consensus”       | Using bots/influencers to shape perception of what’s \"real\" or popular. |\n\n---\n\n###  To Answer Your Question Directly:\n**Yes, people *do* talk about ideas similar to \"manufactured disconsent\"—particularly under the term \"manufactured discontent\" in sectors like gaming and political messaging.** While \"manufactured disconsent\" isn't a widely used phrase, the underlying notion—creating or manipulating public dissent—is very much discussed in media critique, gaming culture, and political campaign analysis.\n\nIf you're considering writing or exploring the idea yourself, these sources could provide a solid foundation. Would you like help unpacking one of these areas further—say, the gaming monetization angle or that anti-TTIP study?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"citeturn0search1","start_idx":777,"end_idx":796,"safe_urls":["https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zytqm0/we_all_need_to_talk_about_manufactured_discontent/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zytqm0/we_all_need_to_talk_about_manufactured_discontent/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"We all need to talk about \"manufactured discontent\" and its ...","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zytqm0/we_all_need_to_talk_about_manufactured_discontent/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1672383391.491,"snippet":"Folding Ideas released an excellent video about the concept of manufacturing discontent in players to push them towards cash shops and unpleasant monetization ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Reddit"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn0search13","start_idx":1105,"end_idx":1125,"safe_urls":["https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/manufactured-discontent/691008?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Blizzard Forums](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/manufactured-discontent/691008?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Manufactured Discontent - General Discussion","url":"https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/manufactured-discontent/691008?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1663350009,"snippet":"Sep 16, 2022 — A while back in 2019 a youtube channel named Folding ideas created a video called “Manufactured Discontent”.

What you mean by **“manufactured disconsent”** is not just unhappiness or discontent, but a deliberate fostering of *rejection of governance itself*. That’s a sharper concept — instead of shaping what people want within the system (manufactured consent) or what they dislike about the system (manufactured discontent), this is about **shaping people to refuse the system’s legitimacy altogether.**\n\nThat framing doesn’t really exist in mainstream terminology under that label, but you’re circling ideas that are studied in a few different fields:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Delegitimization Campaigns**\n- There’s political science work on *delegitimizing institutions* — efforts to erode trust in parliaments, courts, elections, or regulators so that people stop accepting their authority altogether.  \n- For example: Russian disinformation operations often don’t push a particular candidate, but aim to undermine faith in the election process itself (“all sides are corrupt, your vote doesn’t matter”).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Populist Anti-System Narratives**\n- Movements like **sovereign citizens** or **QAnon** don’t just object to specific policies; they reject the very idea that governments or laws have legitimate authority.  \n- Researchers frame this as *anti-system populism* or *anti-establishment delegitimation*. These groups treat the state itself as an occupying force rather than as a legitimate institution.  \n- The “manufactured” part comes in when these narratives are *encouraged, spread, or weaponised* — by influencers, media ecosystems, or even foreign actors — for their own gain.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **From “Manufacturing Consent” → “Manufacturing Cynicism”**\n- Communication theorists talk about how relentless negative coverage or conspiracy-laden media can produce **cynicism rather than consent**.  \n- Instead of mobilising people to support a governing project, the media ecosystem pushes them into a state of rejection: “the system is rigged, politics is fake, none of this applies to me.”\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Sovereign Citizen & Anti-Governance Radicalisation**\n- There are studies of how people get pulled into **sovereign citizen movements** or anarchist-libertarian worldviews where they deny the legitimacy of tax, law, or even policing.  \n- Scholars see these as a form of **radicalisation funnel** similar to far-right extremism: the “manufacture” happens in the echo chamber, where influencers and community norms gradually replace civic trust with categorical rejection.\n\n---\n\nSo your use of **“manufactured disconsent”** would be original phrasing, but it slots into existing debates about:  \n- *delegitimization of institutions*  \n- *anti-system populism*  \n- *cynicism as a political product*  \n- *radicalisation into anti-governance worldviews*\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to pull you some **academic references and news sources** where these kinds of processes (delegitimising governance, radicalising into sovereign citizen rejection, etc.) are being explicitly discussed? That would give you material to build out your “manufactured disconsent” framing."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-6876f53e923481919f351f03171c1acc","request_id":"97b34077ff7f19ac-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"71c563ee-bb92-4826-81b1-53b5d50cabd7","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"71c563ee-bb92-4826-81b1-53b5d50cabd7","children":["6f4b14a1-656a-4bcf-b65b-2ff59aa64671"]},"6f4b14a1-656a-4bcf-b65b-2ff59aa64671":{"id":"6f4b14a1-656a-4bcf-b65b-2ff59aa64671","message":{"id":"6f4b14a1-656a-4bcf-b65b-2ff59aa64671","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757217286.323,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["cynicism doesn't quite cover it either.

I see where you’re going:  \n\n- **Discontent** = dissatisfaction within the system (“this law sucks,” “this policy is unfair”).  \n- **Cynicism** = disbelief that the system works (“all politicians are corrupt, nothing matters”), often leading to withdrawal.  \n- **Disconsent** (as you’re framing it) = active rejection of the system’s *legitimacy* (“the state has no right to make laws over me”), often followed by acts *against* it (sovereign citizens refusing taxes, militias refusing court orders, extremists rejecting any civic obligation).  \n\nSo in your usage, **manufactured disconsent** isn’t just “making people unhappy with government” (discontent) or “teaching them to shrug off politics” (cynicism). It’s **engineering a refusal to be governed at all.**  \n\nThat aligns with some under-used but real threads in research:  \n\n- **Anti-legitimacy movements** – studies on how media ecosystems and disinformation erode not just trust, but the *very idea* that government has a right to rule.  \n- **Anti-system radicalisation** – how people are nudged from frustration into outright rejection of law’s authority (e.g. sovereign citizen ideologies, anti-tax militias, hard secessionist rhetoric).  \n- **Constitutional nihilism** – the view that constitutions and laws are just paper fictions, and rejecting them is framed as a moral or natural right.  \n- **Delegitimation campaigns** – often described in the context of foreign interference: not just “your leaders are bad,” but “your state is fake.”  \n\nIn that sense, what you’re proposing with “manufactured disconsent” is useful language. It describes a **qualitative jump**: from being unhappy about governance → to denying the legitimacy of governance → to resisting it as an obligation.  \n\nWould you like me to dig up examples of where that “jump” has been studied (like sovereign citizens, militias, anti-state movements), so you’ve got concrete cases to anchor the concept?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-6876f53e923481919f351f03171c1acc","request_id":"97b344488cd219ac-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"6f4b14a1-656a-4bcf-b65b-2ff59aa64671","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6f4b14a1-656a-4bcf-b65b-2ff59aa64671","children":["9f2b9056-d1d6-4b84-8fdd-c4dbbef55f87"]},"9f2b9056-d1d6-4b84-8fdd-c4dbbef55f87":{"id":"9f2b9056-d1d6-4b84-8fdd-c4dbbef55f87","message":{"id":"9f2b9056-d1d6-4b84-8fdd-c4dbbef55f87","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757217395.705,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["how does this framing work when applied to my gamer-rage 'laws are bad', instead of 'businesses circumventing laws by making me do work' issue? \n\nThis post I wrote yesterday walks around similar areas...\n\nI think I’ve come round on the OSA - Steam sucks edition\nMaybe I’m going insane cos I’ve read some of the most boring docs this week, but I did a deep dive on the OSA, and have been digesting it, and feel it’s not that bad. Places that are compliant & trustworthy (like Pornhub or Reddit) use good quality and safe verifiers that do not keep your data. There definitely could (and should) have been some more reasonable exclusions (like Xbox, maybe), but over the years even I’ve heard the occasional creepy dude being way too familiar with kids on open voice chat, maybe this does help prevent/discourage that. I don’t like how it incentivises keeping accounts (rather than throwaways that don’t connect everything to you personally), but… it’s not like every social network was trying to avoid holding personal data anyway, so in a good faith world, and understanding that it was a cross-party policy developed over 6 years by mostly idiots (like Nadine Dorries, ffs), it certainly could have been much worse.\n\nIt’s easy to say a law is stupid because it’s “easy to break,” but that’s not the point. It’s easy to break the law about not speeding or not stealing, or even many worse ones, but I wonder what tech all the angry old men on Facebook and angry old women on Instagram think would be harder to bypass.\n\nThe biggest real cost is to small companies trying to set up new platforms, and while it’s not massive, it does cost money to integrate a responsible age verifier. Though it’s at best fractional compared to the bigger cost of per-request/GB cloud infrastructure (already 4-5x a dedicated server). It’s not like verification is going to be the sole factor stopping some fresh faced young business mogul from disrupting YouTube.\n\nIf you’re being forced to verify your age by any platform by providing a scan of your ID or your face (either through tech on their servers, or more commonly through a third-party plug-in), you can do that safely *IF* their verification provider guarantees that they do not keep your photo/video/id-scan stored at all. They do not need it except for at the instant of verification, when they can simply log a flag for your account. Compliant verifiers should be be able to make that claim and prove it.\n\nThe Persistent Failure of Steam’s Management\nThere are already really stupid/lazy implementations: Steam has decided “Your UK Steam user account is considered age verified for as long as a valid credit card is stored on the account.”, which is a moronic policy. I’ve never had a credit card on steam, and I’m pretty sure my account is 20+ years old as I’ve had it since Half Life 2 released.\n\nI know old folks who don’t have a credit card, and some poor folks too, so Steam really need to find a verification service provider and plug them into their system. They only age-gate 18+ rated games (so no sticky anime girls being pushed at kids), which obviously sucks if you’re over 18 and that’s your thing, but some of the creepy stuff Steam have on their platform since they lowered the gates already borders on illegal anyway. It turns out if you don’t moderate your storefront, the nazi-games and the creeps will use it for evil, and no amount of closing your eyes and pretending it isn’t happening is going to make them stop polluting your storefront.\n\nIt’s all good being a techbro neo-hippy until you’re taking 30% of the sale price of games that support steam users to spreading their monstrous SA or ethnic cleansing fantasies in groups on the platform, under the guise of being edgy.\n\nBusinesses gonna business\nSometimes when businesses make you jump through stupid hoops, like scrolling the billion things that could be in your mobile game loot-box, and having to click agree before you can open a free loot-box, or like when you have to click 15 checkboxes before you can close the cookie warning with a setting that isn’t ‘I agree to whatever’, they’re doing it like that on purpose, so you don’t actually take the time to use your rights (it’s called a dark pattern).\n\nSome businesses are doing the same with OSA now, they’re choosing the worst possible option for *you*, so *they* have to change as little as possible. The _point_ of the OSA is to make companies treat you better, not to exploit you and neglect their responsibilities to protect your kids from the hideous people prowling through their infrastructure, and if they won’t… you kinda have to choose to stop using them until they do.\n\nOther countries will be following this model too (probably not the US, but maybe), so you can see this as a pilot for now. They’re not going to undo it, and the decision-makers in the UK govt already think it’s gone pretty well, and that only the optics and the communications were a failure.\n\nI think in the light of patient consideration (and after reading far too many policy PDFs this week), I’ve come around on the OSA. It is a stupid law, but there wasn’t going to be a better one, so fuck it.\n\nTagged: #osa, #onlinesafetyact, #policy, #ukpolitics, #internet, #socialmedia, #privacy, #compliance, #law, #regulation, #platforms, #startups, #infrastructure, #cloud, #verification, #trustandsafety, #tech, #disruption, #steam, #online safety act"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"97b346f44abb19ac-MXP","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7e3661ec-f190-4535-bc04-3275f91d0974","children":["e1c3078e-c9be-49d4-9b18-c794dd6e9719"]},"e1c3078e-c9be-49d4-9b18-c794dd6e9719":{"id":"e1c3078e-c9be-49d4-9b18-c794dd6e9719","message":{"id":"e1c3078e-c9be-49d4-9b18-c794dd6e9719","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757217399.560314,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Right — so if we bring your **manufactured disconsent** framing into this OSA/gamer-rage context, it clarifies the difference between two very different reactions to regulation:  \n\n---\n\n### 1. **Discontent (businesses exploiting loopholes)**  \nThat’s when companies (Steam, mobile games, etc.) implement laws in the laziest, most hostile-to-users way possible.

It’s fuelled and amplified:  \n- By **streamers/influencers** who monetise outrage content.  \n- By **bad-faith actors** (alt-right pipelines, troll farms) who know that turning “law = bad” into a default gamer reflex weakens democratic governance overall.  \n- By **platforms themselves**, who often prefer users to blame the state instead of their shitty implementation — feeding the “all regulation is bad” narrative so they can stay hands-off.  \n\n---\n\n### How it looks in your OSA/Steam case\n- A thoughtful response (your post): *this law is stupidly written but not unfixable; the problem is lazy or malicious compliance by businesses like Steam.*  \n- A manufactured disconsent response: *all regulation is illegitimate; the state has no right to make me verify anything; the only moral position is to reject governance outright.*  \n\nOne is criticism within the system.  \nThe other is a cultivated refusal of the system.  \n\n---\n\nSo in this framing, **“gamer-rage about laws being bad” is a textbook case of manufactured disconsent** — because the raw frustration is real (laws are clunky, Steam sucks), but the step from that frustration to *rejecting the legitimacy of law itself* is being nudged, amplified, and instrumentalised.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to sketch how this would connect to your earlier posts about **nazis in gaming spaces**? Because that’s where the “manufacture” part ties neatly into radicalisation history — you saw first-hand how those funnels worked on DALNet/QuakeNet."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-6876f53e923481919f351f03171c1acc","request_id":"97b346f44abb19ac-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"9f2b9056-d1d6-4b84-8fdd-c4dbbef55f87","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9f2b9056-d1d6-4b84-8fdd-c4dbbef55f87","children":["1e5bf751-b117-4d53-ac12-57bc4d8aa57e"]},"1e5bf751-b117-4d53-ac12-57bc4d8aa57e":{"id":"1e5bf751-b117-4d53-ac12-57bc4d8aa57e","message":{"id":"1e5bf751-b117-4d53-ac12-57bc4d8aa57e","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757217494.33,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["yeah sure."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"97b3495cb8fe19ac-LHR","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e1c3078e-c9be-49d4-9b18-c794dd6e9719","children":["d4aa832a-e1ed-4ef5-a622-e72b1c5effa3"]},"d4aa832a-e1ed-4ef5-a622-e72b1c5effa3":{"id":"d4aa832a-e1ed-4ef5-a622-e72b1c5effa3","message":{"id":"d4aa832a-e1ed-4ef5-a622-e72b1c5effa3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757217499.676403,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Perfect — this is where your **manufactured disconsent** idea and your **“nazis in gamer spaces”** notes dovetail.  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Early gamer rage → manufactured disconsent  \n- In the early IRC/QuakeNet/Steam days, lots of gamer rage started as ordinary **discontent**: bad admin decisions, unfair bans, buggy patches, cheaters.  \n- But some corners quickly redirected that frustration into **disconsent**: “mods are tyrants,” “devs are dictators,” “rules shouldn’t exist at all.”  \n- That jump — from hating a rule to rejecting the right of anyone to make rules — is the seed of manufactured disconsent.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Nazis exploit the funnel  \n- Far-right groups understood the power of that mindset.  \n- If you can get someone from “fuck these rules” to “fuck the very idea of rules,” you’ve primed them to accept **alternative authority structures** (tribes, clans, nationalist or fascist “orders”).  \n- Suddenly the “edgy guy with 88 tattoos” at the LAN party doesn’t seem that crazy — because you’ve already accepted that governance = illegitimate, so *anything else* can fill the vacuum.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. How platforms play into it  \n- Valve’s hands-off approach to moderation (“we just host the games, we’re not responsible”) created fertile ground.  \n- That wasn’t just laziness; it functionally **outsourced governance** to communities — which were often infiltrated or steered by proto-Gamergate, incels, or alt-right groups.  \n- Result: Steam and other gaming hubs became **parallel sovereign zones**, where disconsent was normalised.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Why it resonates with OSA rage now  \n- Today’s anti-OSA rage follows the same path:  \n  - Stage 1: “This implementation sucks.” (legitimate complaint, Steam credit-card nonsense)  \n  - Stage 2: “All laws suck, leave us alone.” (disconsent — rejecting the legitimacy of law itself)  \n- That “stage 2” isn’t natural. It’s cultivated. Influencers, rage-streamers, and extremist networks feed it because it creates a population that sees regulation itself as tyranny.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. The pattern across decades  \n- **OG IRC era**: proto-fascists and conspiracy theorists normalised disconsent by embedding themselves in gaming communities.  \n- **Gamergate era**: influencer-driven outrage pipelines monetised the disconsent.  \n- **OSA era**: new regulation + corporate laziness = fresh fuel for the same funnel.  \n\n---\n\nIf you put that into your blog voice, you can show the straight line from your personal experience (EFNet vs DALNet/QuakeNet communities), through Gamergate, to today’s anti-OSA hysteria — all as recurring **manufactured disconsent cycles**.  \n\n---\n\nWant me to sketch that as a **blog-post style outline** (so you can just flesh it out later), or as a **continuous narrative draft** that picks up from your skeet thread and builds into your “nazis in gaming spaces” angle?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-6876f53e923481919f351f03171c1acc","request_id":"97b3495cb8fe19ac-LHR","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"1e5bf751-b117-4d53-ac12-57bc4d8aa57e","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1e5bf751-b117-4d53-ac12-57bc4d8aa57e","children":["b59d3f3f-cb2f-4060-af92-3cb143c4e64f"]},"b59d3f3f-cb2f-4060-af92-3cb143c4e64f":{"id":"b59d3f3f-cb2f-4060-af92-3cb143c4e64f","message":{"id":"b59d3f3f-cb2f-4060-af92-3cb143c4e64f","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757218167.6594942,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"attachments":[],"rebase_developer_message":true,"timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d4aa832a-e1ed-4ef5-a622-e72b1c5effa3","children":["4e0152e7-451c-4ed9-866d-8a53c7079073"]},"4e0152e7-451c-4ed9-866d-8a53c7079073":{"id":"4e0152e7-451c-4ed9-866d-8a53c7079073","message":{"id":"4e0152e7-451c-4ed9-866d-8a53c7079073","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757218165.687,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["okay, I've moved this into my Better Britain think tank project.

The study, which involved participants using usernames reflecting various religious and ethnic identities, aimed to assess the extent and nature of the harassment. Findings showed widespread use of racial slurs and trash-talking, leading to a normalization of such behavior in online gaming spaces. This is not limited to these games alone, as a separate ADL analysis of the Steam gaming platform revealed millions of instances of extremist and hateful content.\n\nExperts suggest that parents engage in regular conversations with their children about their gaming experiences, teach them how to handle harassment, set gaming boundaries, and discuss appropriate online behavior. They also emphasize the importance of knowing their teen’s virtual friends. The report calls for greater responsibility from the gaming industry and government to address and mitigate hate and harassment in online gaming environments.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1737025260,"attribution":"www.parents.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/not-youtubes-algorithm-radicalizes-people","title":"Maybe It's Not YouTube's Algorithm That Radicalizes People","snippet":"A new paper from Penn State University political scientists Kevin Munger and Joseph Phillips argues that YouTube's role in radicalizing users may not primarily stem from its recommendation algorithm. The study tracks the growth of right-wing political content on YouTube and suggests that the increase in supply and popularity of such content is driven by both the platform's appeal to right-wing creators and an existing audience for this media. They emphasize that users who consume radical content are consuming it due to pre-existing preferences rather than being radicalized by algorithmic suggestions. Other researchers, including Manoel Ribeiro, whose work was misinterpreted by the press, agree that the algorithm's role in radicalization is overstated. Instead, factors such as the low barrier to entry and the ability for creators to engage directly with their audience within the YouTube ecosystem play a larger role. The report notes a rise in viewership for conservative channels, while viewership for more extreme far-right content has declined since 2017. This research challenges current narratives around YouTube's influence and suggests more comprehensive, evidence-based approaches are needed to understand its political impact.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1571828400,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68bd00f3f1f4800bb74d4444a0d5198f","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching reports on gaming, extremism, and far-right influence","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97b359c0dde419ac-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"a8f20b1c-f658-4fef-9fb0-6c01b9730ef4","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a8f20b1c-f658-4fef-9fb0-6c01b9730ef4","children":["0deb0bf9-b856-4300-bfc7-02f938c5f1af"]},"0deb0bf9-b856-4300-bfc7-02f938c5f1af":{"id":"0deb0bf9-b856-4300-bfc7-02f938c5f1af","message":{"id":"0deb0bf9-b856-4300-bfc7-02f938c5f1af","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757218198.038667,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring payments and influence","content":"I need solid evidence about right-wing payments to gamers or streamers.

The study revealed that extremists exploit these platforms for racially abusive livestreams and neo-Nazi propaganda. Steam, in particular, harbors long-standing extremist communities dating back to 2016. These groups use Steam both for socializing and spreading far-right ideologies, occasionally connecting to violent terrorist organizations. While extremists don't typically play extremist-specific games, they often enjoy historical games for ideological fantasies and popular games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for socializing. The research highlighted concerns over the lack of moderation on Steam, contrasting with the more proactive approaches of platforms like DLive, Discord, and Twitch.

OII’s claim that \"publicly identified\" disinformation operations have increased since 2017 is largely based on increased reporting and recognition of the issue, rather than an actual rise in occurrences. The increase in media coverage and actions taken by platforms like Facebook and Twitter have led to higher visibility of disinformation rather than a truthful measure of the problem's scope. Critics argue that the study's reliance on media reports and the categorizations they use can be misleading and may not accurately represent the scale of disinformation, especially due to underreporting in certain parts of the world. Moreover, the report’s findings are being hastily adopted for policy-making, raising concerns about the robustness of the evidence underpinning such decisions. Overall, while disinformation is indeed a growing concern, the study's limitations and potential overstatements risk undermining public trust in research and policy measures designed to combat it.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1613656800,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/terrorists-use-social-media-to-radicalise-young-people-9b2ddv2nj","title":"How extremists dodge moderators to radicalise children online","snippet":"A report has indicated that extremists are evading social media moderation to radicalize young people. Moustafa Ayad from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue highlighted authorities' failure to adapt to new tactics used by terror groups. The Home Office unveiled new anti-terror powers to ban children from accessing the internet due to concerns about rising youth radicalization. Online extremists use mainstream platforms like TikTok and Facebook, exploiting features to evade moderation. Despite being banned, accounts frequently reappear, claiming numerous bans as badges of honor. Extremist content is found on multiple platforms including Discord, WhatsApp, and Roblox, with many users being underage. Experts call for a multi-faceted approach involving parents, law enforcement, and tech companies to address the issue.

I’ve kept it tight, evidence-forward, and focused on what’s *proven* (payments, organized campaigns, monetization pathways), plus the best-supported inferences about how gaming spaces are leveraged by the far right/alt-right.\n\n# Executive summary\n- Since ~2013, gaming-adjacent platforms (Steam, Discord, Twitch/DLive, YouTube/Rumble) have been used as **low-friction venues for audience growth, recruitment, and monetization** by far-right and alt-right figures. Multiple studies document **persistent extremist communities** on Steam/Discord and a migration of banned creators to alternative livestream platforms where they can solicit donations from young, gamer-heavy audiences. citeturn2search2turn2search0turn3news20  \n- **Paid influence and organized messaging** intersect with gaming spaces in two main ways:  \n  1) **Political influence programs** that pay young creators to post partisan messages across mainstream platforms (some overlapping with gaming creators). Example: Turning Point Action’s covert 2020 influencer operation (teens paid to post election content), later linked to a banned “troll farm” network by Facebook. citeturn0search4turn0search9  \n  2) **Monetization of extremist streamers** via donations/subscriptions on alternative platforms (notably DLive) that skew young and gaming-adjacent; researchers have quantified significant earnings for far-right streamers. citeturn3search0turn3search2turn3search6\n- **Strategic cultivation of gamer audiences** traces back to Breitbart under Steve Bannon, which explicitly targeted “angry young male” online communities in the mid-2010s (including via Gamergate coverage) as a political on-ramp. This is not a payroll for game streamers per se, but it *is* a documented, funded media strategy linking culture-war grievance in gamer spaces to right-populist politics. citeturn0search8turn0search12turn1news26\n- For UK relevance and the OSA discourse: credible research shows **extreme-right organizing on Steam and Discord**, long-running and under-moderated, which makes gamer communities a convenient base for **delegitimising regulation** narratives (“laws are illegitimate,” not just “this implementation is annoying”). citeturn2search2turn2search0turn2news20\n\n---\n\n# What we *know* (evidence base)\n\n## A. Far-right presence and networking in gaming ecosystems\n- **Steam**: ISD mapped extremist communities on Steam (interlinked groups, iconography, cross-platform links), showing Steam as a social hub rather than a place for “extremist games.” The issue is **community/social affordances** with weak moderation and longevity since mid-2010s. citeturn2search2  \n- **Discord**: ISD documented how far-right actors used Discord for organizing, content dissemination, and social bonding—again capitalizing on gamer-centric affordances. (Discord was also central to the planning milieu for Unite the Right more broadly, per investigative reporting.) citeturn2search0turn1search1  \n- **Livestreaming/alt platforms**: After enforcement on YouTube/Twitch, many creators shifted to **DLive**, which offered easy donations and permissive moderation; research quantified far-right revenue there (and coverage tied DLive to January 6 streams). citeturn3search0turn3news20\n\n## B. Monetization and payments (direct and adjacent)\n- **Documented paid political influence ops**:  \n  - **Turning Point Action (2020)** covertly paid a network of teens to post pro-Trump talking points; Facebook later banned a linked marketing firm (Rally Forge) running a “troll farm” on TPUSA/Turning Point Action’s behalf. This is proof of **paid youth influencer operations** at scale—some participants were in creator/gamer demographics, even if not exclusively “gaming streamers.” citeturn0search4turn0search9\n- **Extremist streamer income**:  \n  - Peer-reviewed and journalistic work shows far-right streamers **earning substantial donations** on DLive (and similar layers like Streamlabs/StreamElements facilitating income), confirming a **cash incentive** to sustain/expand radical audiences common in gaming-adjacent streaming. citeturn3search0turn3search4turn3news22\n\n## C. Strategic targeting of gamer demographics (media/political)\n- **Breitbart/Bannon’s gamer calculus (2014–2017)**: Reporting and scholarship around *Devil’s Bargain* outline Bannon’s explicit view that the “young, angry male” online cohort (high overlap with gamer communities) was a **ripe constituency** for nationalist populism. Breitbart Tech’s Gamergate coverage cultivated that audience as an on-ramp into politics. This was funded through Mercer-backed media infrastructure. citeturn0search8turn1news26  \n- **YouTube’s “Alternative Influence Network” (2018)**: Data & Society mapped a **network of creators** (many gaming-adjacent or culturally adjacent) whose collaboration and cross-promotion funneled audiences toward reactionary/right content—showing how “influencer marketing” techniques were applied to politics. (Debate continues on how much the algorithm vs. *supply & creator networks* drove radicalization; both matter.) citeturn0search12turn0search2turn0search17turn0news51\n\n---\n\n# What’s **proven vs. plausible** about “paid gamers/streamers” since ~2013\n\n- **Proven (documented money flows):**  \n  - **Paid youth influencer programs** aligned with the US right (Turning Point Action 2020) that operated across mainstream social platforms where gaming creators are common. citeturn0search4turn0search9  \n  - **Significant streamer earnings** for far-right personalities on gamer-adjacent livestream ecosystems (e.g., DLive). This is income from audiences, not party committees, but it demonstrates **financially sustained propaganda** in spaces with high gamer overlap. citeturn3search0turn3search2  \n  - **Funded media strategy** (Breitbart/Mercer/Bannon) deliberately courting gamer-centric online demographics—and turning culture-war grievance into political mobilization. citeturn1news26turn0search8\n\n- **Plausible but not cleanly evidenced (use caution):**  \n  - **Direct, routine payments from far-right political orgs specifically to *gaming* streamers to push anti-government narratives** since ~2013. There are **individual cases** of far-right online figures with gaming roots receiving funding/donations/contracts (e.g., alternative platforms, PAC-adjacent ecosystems, individual patronage), but **systematic, documented pipelines** paying *gaming streamers as gaming streamers* to attack government are **not well-evidenced in open sources**. (What we do have is a mesh of media patronage, influencer programs, and donation-driven streaming that heavily overlaps with gamer audiences.) citeturn2search6\n\n---\n\n# How this underpins today’s OSA “laws-are-illegitimate” rage\n- Research shows **extremist ecosystems embedded on Steam/Discord since mid-2010s**, normalizing grievance and conspiracism within gamer social graphs. When new regulation (OSA) arrives, the pre-existing grievance frame is **redirected from “bad implementation” to “government is illegitimate.”** That’s your **manufactured disconsent** jump: cultivated communities + monetized outrage → categorical rejection of governance rather than criticism of a platform’s choices. citeturn2search2turn2search0\n- Meanwhile, **platform mis-implementation** (e.g., Steam’s flimsy age-check) provides real friction that rage-entrepreneurs can amplify, turning specific UX annoyances into **generalized anti-law narratives**. (Contrast with Reddit’s relatively smooth path, blunting that narrative.) **The vector isn’t the law alone—it’s the ecosystem built to weaponize any regulatory friction.** citeturn2news20\n\n---\n\n# Timeline (anchor moments, 2013→present)\n- **2013–2015: Gamergate.** Online harassment campaign becomes an organizing crucible for the reactionary right; Breitbart leans in, cultivating gamer-adjacent grievance audiences. citeturn1search0turn1search2  \n- **2016–2018: Consolidation.** Charlottesville planning milieu surfaces Discord’s role; Bannon/Mercer-backed media strategy matures; YouTube “Alternative Influence Network” is mapped; extremist presence on Steam/Discord entrenches. citeturn1search1turn1news26turn0search12turn2search2  \n- **2019–2021: Enforcement & migration.** De-platforming pushes creators to DLive/Rumble; research quantifies extremist streamer earnings; January 6 shows livestream + monetization dynamics in action. citeturn3search0turn3news20  \n- **2020: Paid youth influence op.** Turning Point Action’s covert influencer network demonstrates at-scale paid messaging among young creators (overlapping with gamer demographics). citeturn0search4turn0search9  \n- **2021–2025: UK/EU focus on gaming & extremism.** ISD series on Steam/Discord; RUSI and EU policy work on gaming/extremism; continued evidence of hate/harassment normalization in online games. citeturn2search2turn2search0turn2search10turn0search16\n\n---\n\n# How this fed Trumpism and global populism\n- **Audience building**: Gamer-heavy online spaces helped assemble large, hyper-engaged male audiences predisposed to anti-elite narratives—audiences Breitbart/alt-right media then routed into electoral politics. citeturn1news26turn0search12  \n- **Memetics & community**: Gaming culture’s in-jokes, streaming parasociality, and raid/brigade tactics translated seamlessly into **political meme warfare** and coordinated harassment, both key to Trump-era online campaigning. citeturn1search2  \n- **Funding loop**: Alternative platforms and donation stacks turned radical content into **sustainable income**, incentivizing escalation and persistence. (This matters even more than formal “payrolls.”) citeturn3search0  \n- **Policy backlash**: When governments tighten online rules (e.g., OSA), the already-primed narrative machine re-frames enforcement as tyranny, reinforcing **anti-governance** populism. citeturn2news20\n\n---\n\n# Gaps, caveats, and where to be careful\n- **Algorithm vs. supply debate**: Some research suggests **creator supply and audience demand** (not just algorithms) drive exposure to right-wing content; treat “the algorithm radicalized them” as *incomplete*. Policy should address **networked creator ecosystems + monetization**, not just recommendations. citeturn0news51  \n- **“Paid gamer-streamers by parties”**: Beyond specific cases (TPA, individual patronage, platform contracts), there isn’t robust open-source evidence of a long-running, centralized program that *systematically* pays game-category streamers to push anti-government lines. The **dominant mechanism** appears to be **ideological media patronage + platform monetization**, not classic campaign payrolls. citeturn2search6\n\n---\n\n# Implications for OSA communications (Better Britain angle)\n1) **Name the vector**: Emphasize the difference between *platform friction* (fixable, implementation) and **anti-governance framing** (deliberately cultivated).  \n2) **Starve the incentive**: Focus enforcement and industry pressure on **financial rails** (donation widgets, payout services) that keep extremist streamers solvent. citeturn3news22  \n3) **Flood the zone with competence**: Publicize **good implementations** (e.g., fast privacy-preserving age checks) to undercut rage content’s raw material.  \n4) **Target the hubs**: Steam and Discord remain **high-leverage** for counter-extremism nudges and moderation partnerships in the UK context. citeturn2search2turn2search0  \n5) **Influencer transparency**: Push for **clear labeling of paid political content** and **disclosure rules for influencer programs** (TPA-style ops) so audiences know when they’re being marketed to. citeturn0search4\n\n---\n\n## Key sources (starter pack)\n- ISD “Gaming & Extremism” series: **Steam** and **Discord** briefings. citeturn2search2turn2search0  \n- Data & Society (2018): **Alternative Influence Network** (YouTube). citeturn0search12  \n- DLive monetization of far-right streamers (peer-reviewed + reportage). citeturn3search0turn3search4  \n- Turning Point Action 2020 paid influencer operation (WaPo; Facebook enforcement). citeturn0search4turn0search9  \n- Bannon/Mercer/Breitbart strategy and funding (New Yorker; interviews/coverage of *Devil’s Bargain*). citeturn1news26turn0search8\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a full Better Britain brief with an executive slide, one-page summary, and a “policy options” appendix tailored to OSA comms (UK audience)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"citeturn2search2turn2search0turn3news20","start_idx":753,"end_idx":797,"safe_urls":["https://www.isdglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/02-revised-gaming-report-steam.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.isdglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/04-gaming-report-discord.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.wired.com/story/dlive-livestreaming-site-extremist-haven?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([ISD](https://www.isdglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/02-revised-gaming-report-steam.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/dlive-livestreaming-site-extremist-haven?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"The Extreme Right on Steam | ISD","url":"https://www.isdglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/02-revised-gaming-report-steam.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1628766426,"snippet":"by P Vaux · Cited by 21 — This briefing is part of ISD's Gaming and.

These groups use Steam both for socializing and spreading far-right ideologies, occasionally connecting to violent terrorist organizations. While extremists don't typically play extremist-specific games, they often enjoy historical games for ideological fantasies and popular games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for socializing.

The study tracks the growth of right-wing political content on YouTube and suggests that the increase in supply and popularity of such content is driven by both the platform's appeal to right-wing creators and an existing audience for this media. They emphasize that users who consume radical content are consuming it due to pre-existing preferences rather than being radicalized by algorithmic suggestions. Other researchers, including Manoel Ribeiro, whose work was misinterpreted by the press, agree that the algorithm's role in radicalization is overstated. Instead, factors such as the low barrier to entry and the ability for creators to engage directly with their audience within the YouTube ecosystem play a larger role. The report notes a rise in viewership for conservative channels, while viewership for more extreme far-right content has declined since 2017. This research challenges current narratives around YouTube's influence and suggests more comprehensive, evidence-based approaches are needed to understand its political impact.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":51}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"WIRED"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn0search4turn0search9","start_idx":5540,"end_idx":5572,"safe_urls":["https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/turning-point-teens-disinformation-trump/2020/09/15/c84091ae-f20a-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/08/facebook-bans-media-consultancy-running-troll-farm-pro-trump-youth-group/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/turning-point-teens-disinformation-trump/2020/09/15/c84091ae-f20a-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Pro-Trump youth group enlists teens in secretive campaign ...","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/turning-point-teens-disinformation-trump/2020/09/15/c84091ae-f20a-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1600207503,"snippet":"Sep 15, 2020 — The sprawling operation by Turning Point Action, led by conservative activist Charlie Kirk, evades guardrails put in place to prevent the ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Facebook bans marketing firm running 'troll farm' for pro- ...","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/08/facebook-bans-media-consultancy-running-troll-farm-pro-trump-youth-group/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1602172830.354,"snippet":"Oct 8, 2020 — The firm, Rally Forge, was “working on behalf of Turning Point USA,” Facebook concluded, stopping short of penalizing the tax-exempt ...","attribution":"The Washington Post"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Washington Post"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn3search0turn3search2","start_idx":5841,"end_idx":5873,"safe_urls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05929?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://time.com/5881595/right-wing-conspiracy-theorists-coronavirus/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05929?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [TIME](https://time.com/5881595/right-wing-conspiracy-theorists-coronavirus/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"How Far-right Extremists Earn Money by Video Streaming","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05929?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"by M Squire · 2021 · Cited by 16 — Monetizing Propaganda: How Far-right Extremists Earn Money by ... far-right extremist content and receive donations on the DLive platform.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"arXiv"},{"title":"How Far-Right Personalities and Conspiracy Theorists Are Cashing in on the Pandemic Online","url":"https://time.com/5881595/right-wing-conspiracy-theorists-coronavirus/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1597917948,"snippet":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, far-right personalities, white nationalists, and conspiracy theorists migrated from mainstream to lesser-known streaming platforms like DLive after bans on sites like YouTube for spreading hate speech and misinformation.

The study revealed that extremists exploit these platforms for racially abusive livestreams and neo-Nazi propaganda. Steam, in particular, harbors long-standing extremist communities dating back to 2016. These groups use Steam both for socializing and spreading far-right ideologies, occasionally connecting to violent terrorist organizations. While extremists don't typically play extremist-specific games, they often enjoy historical games for ideological fantasies and popular games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for socializing. The research highlighted concerns over the lack of moderation on Steam, contrasting with the more proactive approaches of platforms like DLive, Discord, and Twitch.

The study tracks the growth of right-wing political content on YouTube and suggests that the increase in supply and popularity of such content is driven by both the platform's appeal to right-wing creators and an existing audience for this media. They emphasize that users who consume radical content are consuming it due to pre-existing preferences rather than being radicalized by algorithmic suggestions. Other researchers, including Manoel Ribeiro, whose work was misinterpreted by the press, agree that the algorithm's role in radicalization is overstated. Instead, factors such as the low barrier to entry and the ability for creators to engage directly with their audience within the YouTube ecosystem play a larger role. The report notes a rise in viewership for conservative channels, while viewership for more extreme far-right content has declined since 2017. This research challenges current narratives around YouTube's influence and suggests more comprehensive, evidence-based approaches are needed to understand its political impact.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":51}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"WIRED"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn2search6","start_idx":10800,"end_idx":10819,"safe_urls":["https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-02/EUIF%20Technical%20Meeting%20on%20Video%20Gaming%20October%202021%20RAN%20Policy%20Support%20paper_en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Migration and Home Affairs](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-02/EUIF%20Technical%20Meeting%20on%20Video%20Gaming%20October%202021%20RAN%20Policy%20Support%20paper_en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"VIDEO GAMING AND (VIOLENT) EXTREMISM:","url":"https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-02/EUIF%20Technical%20Meeting%20on%20Video%20Gaming%20October%202021%20RAN%20Policy%20Support%20paper_en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1632907986,"snippet":"In recent work which analysed the use of video gaming-related platforms (Steam, Discord, Twitch, DLive), there was limited evidence to demonstrate.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":6}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Migration and Home Affairs"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn3news22","start_idx":11218,"end_idx":11236,"safe_urls":["https://www.wired.com/story/streamlabs-streamelements-far-right-white-supremacy-monetize?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/streamlabs-streamelements-far-right-white-supremacy-monetize?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Gaming Sites Are Still Letting Streamers Profit From Hate","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/streamlabs-streamelements-far-right-white-supremacy-monetize?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1612465800.533,"snippet":"Despite efforts by major social media platforms to de-platform and demonetize hate speech, extremist content continues to generate income through financial services essential to gaming streamers on platforms like Twitch and YouTube.

This marked the start of media scrutiny of video game violence.  \n- **1983:** *Custer’s Revenge*, an adult Atari game depicting sexual violence, sparks protests. About 250 people demonstrated at its debut, and the game saw little success amid backlash over its offensive content【10†L109-L116】. These early controversies began framing video games as a new cultural battleground.\n\n## 1990s: Moral Panics and Gamer Identity Solidifies  \n- **1993–94:** Violent games like *Mortal Kombat* and *Night Trap* fuel U.S. Congressional hearings on video game violence. Lawmakers decry the games as “disgusting” and harmful, especially to children【10†L118-L126】. In response, the industry establishes the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994 to self-regulate content and stave off government censorship【10†L130-L138】. This was a pivotal moment when gamers saw themselves as a community under political attack.  \n- **1997:** Anti-game activist lawyer Jack Thompson files his first lawsuit blaming a video game for teenage violence. It’s the first of many such suits Thompson pursues, claiming games cause real-world aggression【11†L1-L9】. (He would eventually be permanently disbarred in 2008 for professional misconduct【18†L1-L4】.) Thompson’s crusade made him a nemesis of gamers and a symbol of “outsider” moral panic.  \n- **1999:** The Columbine High School massacre ignites a fresh moral panic blaming video games. The teenage shooters were known to play *Doom*, leading media and officials to argue violent games contributed to the tragedy【14†L19-L27】. This prompted a wave of research into games and aggression – ultimately, studies found **no causal link** between video games and violent behavior【13†L175-L180】. Gamers, feeling scapegoated, rallied around the principle that societal violence had deeper causes, not *Doom* or *Quake*. \n\n## 2000s: Community Growth, Online Culture, and Backlash  \n- **2003:** Gamers organize for positive impact. Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins of the Penny Arcade webcomic launch the **“Child’s Play”** charity to counter negative media stereotypes of gamers. Within a month their gaming community raised over $250,000 in toys and cash for children’s hospitals【33†L31-L39】, showcasing gamers’ ability to mobilize for good and improve their public image.  \n- **2005:** The “**Hot Coffee**” scandal rocks the industry. A hidden sexual mini-game in *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* is discovered, prompting outrage over video game content. Rockstar Games had to pull the title from shelves until it could be re-rated, and Senator Hillary Clinton even proposed federal legislation to punish retailers who sell adult-rated games to minors【31†L135-L143】. Although the bill failed, this episode reinforced the gamer community’s sense of being under fire from politicians – and many gamers pushed back, citing First Amendment protections.  \n- **2011:** A major legal victory for gamers’ rights. In *Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association* (2011), the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down California’s law banning sale of violent games to minors. The Court affirms that video games qualify as protected free speech under the First Amendment, and that regulating game content beyond the existing ratings is unconstitutional【20†L482-L490】. This landmark ruling – written by Justice Antonin Scalia – equated violent games to Grimm’s fairy tales in terms of protected expression【20†L485-L493】, and was celebrated by gamers as validation of games as a legitimate medium.  \n- **2000s – Early Online Culture:** The 2000s see explosive growth in online gaming and gamer communities. MMO games and services like Xbox Live connect millions of players globally, while dedicated forums emerge as gamer hubs. Notably, the anonymous imageboard **4chan** (founded 2003) and other forums like Something Awful cultivated a new internet subculture around gaming and memes【17†L223-L231】. These spaces amplified both the camaraderie and the **“toxic gamer”** archetype – setting the stage for the cultural clashes to come in the next decade.\n\n## 2010s: Diversification, Gamergate, and the Culture Wars  \n- **2010s Demographics:** Gaming’s audience diversifies significantly. By mid-decade, nearly half of gamers are female (41% in a 2016 survey)【7†L275-L283】, and the average gamer is in their 30s. As women and other underrepresented groups become more visible in gaming, a fringe of male gamers react with hostility – resisting what they see as “their” space changing. This tension underpins several controversies in the 2010s.  \n- **2012:** Feminist media critic **Anita Sarkeesian** launches a Kickstarter for a web series examining gender tropes in games, and faces immediate vicious harassment (including threats and hacking) before the series even begins. This foreshadows a broader backlash against inclusion in gaming. By the time Sarkeesian’s *Tropes vs Women in Video Games* videos release, she endures bomb threats and torrents of online abuse, simply for critiquing games’ portrayals of women【16†L201-L208】. The stage is set for a larger conflagration.  \n- **2014: Gamergate Begins:** The **Gamergate** controversy erupts, exposing a deep rift in gamer culture. It starts in August 2014 when an angry ex-boyfriend of indie developer **Zoë Quinn** posts false allegations that she traded sex for a good game review. Although the accusations were proven baseless, they sparked a campaign of online **harassment** against Quinn【17†L223-L231】. Under the banner of “ethics in games journalism,” swarms of anonymous gamers (primarily young, white, and male) began coordinating on forums to attack Quinn and other women in the industry. The harassment quickly escalated to doxxing, rape and death threats, and relentless abuse on platforms like 4chan and Reddit【17†L223-L231】. Developer **Brianna Wu** and critic **Anita Sarkeesian** were among the women bombarded with misogynistic threats. What had been a smoldering resentment of “social justice” in games exploded into a full-blown culture war within gaming.  \n- **2014–2015: Gamergate’s Expansion and Alt-Right Links:** As the movement gained traction, actor **Adam Baldwin** coined the Twitter hashtag **#GamerGate**, giving the campaign a cohesive rallying tag. Right-wing pundits seized the moment: Breitbart tech editor **Milo Yiannopoulos** championed Gamergate, portraying it as a justified rebellion against “political correctness” in gaming【17†L235-L243】. Discussions about Gamergate grew so toxic that 4chan eventually banned the topic, leading diehards to regroup on the more permissive **8chan** forum【17†L229-L233】. Behind the scenes, Breitbart executive **Steve Bannon** saw an opportunity. Bannon later acknowledged that he used Breitbart’s coverage to **draw Gamergate supporters into the emerging alt-right movement**【17†L235-L243】. In effect, Gamergate became a recruitment pipeline: the same young men furious about feminism in games were courted by far-right political operatives. The tactics honed in Gamergate – mass harassment, conspiracy theories, victimhood narratives – presaged later culture-war flareups. Indeed, veterans of Gamergate would go on to fuel 2016’s infamous **“Pizzagate”** conspiracy and even the QAnon phenomenon that followed【17†L197-L204】. Gamergate’s legacy was a realization that gamer communities could be weaponized in larger political and culture conflicts.  \n- **2016:** The influence of gamer-culture warfare on mainstream politics became apparent. Several figures associated with Gamergate and adjacent online communities played notable roles in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Donald Trump’s chief strategist in the White House was Steve Bannon, fresh off harnessing Breitbart’s Gamergate-engaged audience【16†L183-L190】. Meanwhile, Gamergate-aligned trolls and meme-makers injected their anti-establishment, anti-“SJW” (social justice warrior) ethos into the pro-Trump online army. This year underscored that the divisions within gaming (progressive vs reactionary gamers) were a microcosm of broader societal divides – and that gamers were now a recognized political demographic to be courted.  \n\n## 2020s: Modern Challenges and Recognition  \n- **2019: Gamers Push Back on Scapegoating:** High-profile violence once again brought gamers under external criticism – and this time the gaming community answered back. In 2019, after a school shooting in Brazil, the country’s vice president blamed video games for addicting youth and fostering violence. Gamers responded with the viral hashtag **#SomosGamersNãoAssassinos** (“We are gamers, not murderers”), rejecting the old narrative that games cause real-world killings【20†L549-L557】. The same year in the U.S., following mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, some politicians (including President Trump) loudly denounced “gruesome and grisly video games” as a cause【20†L561-L570】. This drew immediate criticism from media and experts, who pointed out – yet again – that studies show no link between gaming and violent crime【20†L571-L574】. After decades of being a cultural scapegoat, the gamer community in 2019 was more organized and vocal in defending itself with facts and “receipts.”  \n- **2020: Mainstream and Pandemic Boom:** Gaming cemented itself as mainstream culture in the early 2020s. By 2020, the global games market was a $180+ billion industry, bigger than film or music【5†L23-L27】. The COVID-19 pandemic then supercharged gaming’s popularity – with billions of people under lockdown, video games became a critical social outlet. Game engagement surged worldwide during quarantines【7†L227-L234】, and even non-gamers turned to platforms like *Animal Crossing* or *Jackbox* to connect with friends. This period erased any doubt that “gamer” was a broad identity cutting across age, gender, and geography. However, the influx of new players also brought fresh scrutiny to gaming communities’ behavior.  \n- **2021:** The gaming world faced a #MeToo-style reckoning. Multiple major game companies were hit with lawsuits and exposés about toxic workplace culture and sexual harassment (e.g. the California suit against Activision Blizzard in mid-2021). At the same time, dozens of women in esports and streaming shared stories of abuse by male peers. These revelations forced parts of the gamer community to confront long-standing sexism and bullying in its ranks. Industry leaders promised reforms, and gamers began more openly discussing issues of harassment and inclusivity that had festered for years.  \n- **2022: Extremism in Gaming Gets Noticed:** By 2022, government and civil society groups formally recognized that extremist groups were trying to exploit gaming spaces. The Biden Administration’s national strategy on domestic terrorism flagged the **“vulnerability of video game communities to extremist recruitment”**, calling for new efforts to reach gamers with prevention programs【29†L229-L237】. In other words, even the White House acknowledged that online games – with their huge, young user base – had become a target for hate groups and needed proactive intervention.  \n- **2022: Data on Toxicity and Hate –** A report by the Anti-Defamation League underscored the scope of the problem. In a large survey, **86% of U.S. adults who play online multiplayer games reported experiencing harassment in the past six months** (with 77% suffering severe abuse like physical threats and stalking – a jump from 65% three years earlier)【36†L330-L338】. Perhaps more alarming, nearly **one in ten** young gamers (age 13–17) had been exposed to white-supremacist or extremist ideologies in online games, an estimated 2.3 million teens in absolute terms【24†L79-L87】. These findings (“Hate Is No Game,” 2022) confirmed what many gamers already knew: racism, misogyny, and extremist rhetoric were rampant in many game lobbies and chats, often unchecked. The report added urgency to calls for game companies to improve moderation and for communities to police themselves.  \n- **2023 and Beyond:** The struggle to define gamer culture continues. On one hand, gaming is more popular and diverse than ever – over 3 billion people play games, and professional esports and streaming turn top gamers into celebrities. On the other hand, the issues of **toxicity, gatekeeping, and political radicalization** remain pressing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord have begun cracking down on hate speech; game studios are implementing stricter codes of conduct for players. Gamers are increasingly aware of their community’s perception and are pushing initiatives for inclusivity and mental health. Yet debates rage on topics from representation in games to monetization practices (loot boxes, NFTs) and the role of AI. In essence, the network of gamers worldwide – forged by decades of shared passion, conflict, and innovation – is now grappling with growing pains in full public view. Each influence and event listed in this timeline has, in its own way, shaped the modern gamer community that we now inhabit. \n\n**Sources:** The information above is drawn from historical records, research reports, and authoritative sources on video game culture.

From the early days, gamers felt under attack by outside forces – politicians, media, parents – blaming games for society’s ills. In the 1990s, moral panics around violent games (like the **Mortal Kombat** controversy that led to age ratings) painted gamers as maladjusted or dangerous. In response, a strong group identity formed among gaming enthusiasts. They saw themselves as a misunderstood tribe defending a beloved hobby against ignorant outsiders. As one observer noted during the 2014 “Gamergate” flare-up, many traditional gamers felt the world was **“starting to turn against aspects of their favourite pastime”**, creating a defensive, *siege* mentality【13†L127-L134】. This tribal outlook – gamers banding together to protect “gaming” – became a core feature of online gamer culture. It also planted seeds of resentment against “outsiders” (journalists, academics, activists) who were perceived as threatening gamer autonomy.\n\nCrucially, gamer culture prizes personal agency and control. Video games themselves foster a sense of *mastery*: the player is in charge, overcoming challenges through skill. This mindset translated into real-life attitudes. Gamers grew accustomed to autonomy and were often skeptical of authority or mainstream norms. Many carried a libertarian streak – a belief in *personal sovereignty* – shaped by countless hours as the hero of their own digital adventures. They valued free expression (even if crude or edgy) and resisted outside interference. So when external authorities tried to police games or gamer behavior, the reaction was often fierce. Rather than bow to criticism, gamers doubled down on *self-determination*: **“If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere,”** as one gamer-blogger put it, reflecting a common rejection of outsider judgment【1†L39-L47】【1†L41-L48】. This cultural DNA set the stage for both positive solidarity and darker radicalization within gamer communities.\n\n## Newsgroups, IRC, and LAN Clans: Incubating a Subculture  \n【49†embed_image】 *A 2000s-era LAN party: friends haul in their PCs, sodas, and snacks for an overnight gaming marathon. Such gatherings built tight-knit gamer “clans” with their own norms and bonds.*  \nLong before social media, gamer culture thrived in semi-private online and offline spaces. In the 90s, **Usenet newsgroups** (like `rec.games.video.arcade` or `alt.games.doom`) and early forums allowed gamers worldwide to swap tips, mods, and war stories. These text-based communities were often insular – heavy on in-jokes and informal hierarchies – but they forged a sense of brotherhood among early adopters of the “Net.” By the early 2000s, **IRC (Internet Relay Chat)** had become a backbone of gamer communication. Entire networks (e.g. QuakeNet) sprang up to serve gaming clans. *“Every clan had their channel, some easily reached 1000+ people,”* one veteran recalled of the early 2000s, referencing how teams would idle on IRC to scrimmage and socialize【17†L10-L18】. These clan channels and forums functioned like digital clubhouses: membership conferred belonging, and reputation in the clan could mean more than one’s real-life status.\n\nAt the same time, **LAN parties** – in-person gatherings where gamers linked their computers on a local network – were a cultural phenomenon. Dozens (sometimes hundreds) of young people would lug bulky PCs into basements or rented halls for all-night multiplayer sessions. Clans that practiced online might meet face-to-face at big LAN events or tournaments. The atmosphere mixed camaraderie and *tribalism*: groups of friends (or online teammates finally meeting in person) bonded over shared passion for games, often developing their own slang, traditions, and rivalries. Importantly, these gatherings were overwhelmingly male and youth-dominated, which sometimes bred an echo chamber. “LAN parties were welcoming on so many levels,” one participant reminisced – yet he also noted there were *“isles of misogynist folk”* in the crowd who *“kept to themselves and were there to game”*【20†L406-L414】. In his case, he ended up chatting with a group of unkempt, socially awkward LAN-goers who espoused extreme ideas: *“highly intellectual... but I didn't approve of their extremist views and you could tell something went wrong somewhere with their psyche”*【20†L417-L421】. Still, because *everyone was there to play games*, a live-and-let-live attitude prevailed: *“they respected you as you were there too to do the same”*【20†L412-L419】. Encounters like this were not uncommon – fringe or radical opinions (misogyny, racist jokes, conspiracy talk) sometimes circulated in gamer circles, but were tolerated as long as the person could fragdoll opponents in **Counter-Strike** or grind raids in **World of Warcraft**. In these semi-private arenas, extreme sentiments could incubate under the guise of *edgy gamer humor* or “intellectual” debate, largely unchecked by outside voices.\n\nThe structures of early gamer communities thus provided ideal conditions for **identity fusion** and even radicalization. Tight-knit clans offered belonging to those who felt like misfits offline. A shared sense of **“us (gamers) vs. them (outsiders)”** was reinforced in countless chat logs and forum posts. Group loyalty (to one’s clan or guild) encouraged conformity and trust in insider opinions. And importantly, the anonymity or pseudonymity of online handles meant one could voice outrageous or hateful ideas with minimal consequence. It was in these newsgroups, IRC channels, and LAN party backrooms that gamer culture’s penchant for **tribal loyalty, dark humor, and anti-authority sentiment** first intertwined – sometimes harmlessly, but other times forming the early currents of radical thought that would grow stronger in later years.\n\n## “For the Lulz”: From Trolling to Organized Harassment  \nIn the mid-2000s, the chaotic energy of gamer subculture gave birth to a new phenomenon: **internet trolling collectives**. As more gamers congregated on anonymous forums like 4chan (originally launched in 2003 as an anime and video game imageboard), they found that acting collectively could amplify their mischief. What began as pranks and “raids” for laughs – **“for the lulz”** in meme-speak – developed into coordinated operations with real targets. These weren’t driven by ideology at first, but by a subversive *sense of play*. Users on 4chan’s `/b/` board (the infamous random board populated largely by bored adolescents and young adults, many of them gamers) would band together to disrupt online games and communities just to sow chaos. A legendary example was the 2006 **Habbo Hotel raid**: hundreds of 4chan users created identical avatar characters (a black man in a suit and afro) and flooded into the Habbo Hotel virtual world, blocking the digital swimming pool while spamming the phrase “Pool’s closed due to AIDS”【36†L9-L17】. This offensive prank – a mix of absurd humor and bigotry – became a meme unto itself, *“carried out by Anonymous”* (as the participants styled themselves), and demonstrated how quickly an online mob of gamers could mobilize on a whim to overwhelm a system.\n\nSuch antics, repeated over various incidents, built a kind of *proto-activist* skillset in gamer communities. They learned to brigade forums, flood polls, DDoS websites, and swarm chat rooms. Importantly, they did it *for fun*, reveling in anarchy and seeing it as a game. This dynamic of treating real harassment or disruption as a **multiplayer game** set the stage for more serious campaigns. By the late 2000s, the loose collective calling itself **Anonymous** (originating from 4chan’s default username) began to take on *“enemies”* in the real world. In 2008, provoked by the Church of Scientology’s attempt to censor a viral video, Anonymous launched **Project Chanology** – a campaign of protests, prank calls, and hacks against Scientology. Many involved were the same young gamers who had honed their tactics in raid-style “griefing” online【37†L9-L17】. Now they applied those tactics to a cause, adopting the Guy Fawkes mask from *V for Vendetta* as their icon. While *Project Chanology* mixed sincere protest with trollish stunts, it marked a turning point: gamer-born internet culture showed it could **mobilize crowds (both online and in person) for collective action**. As one MIT analysis noted, these participants treated the campaign like a game: *“just like video games, when a member of Anonymous sits down to attack Scientology… he is entering a virtual world”* of shared purpose and playful aggression【37†L13-L17】.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of such actions remained **leaderless and chaotic**. There was no formal organization – just ad-hoc swarms rallying around a meme or target. This meant that malicious agendas could hide within the mayhem. The same “for the lulz” operations that took down harmful targets could just as easily be turned toward *harassing individuals* for arbitrary reasons. Throughout late 2000s and early 2010s, there were cases of online mobs (originating in gamer/troll circles) dogpiling on vulnerable people: females on tech forums, minority bloggers, or even random kids who became meme fodder. Often it was framed as *pranking* or *teaching a lesson* to someone deemed laughable by the group. But the effect was organized bullying. \n\nBy 2014, this strain of gamer-driven mob harassment reached a fever pitch in what would become known as **#GamerGate** – an incident often cited as a gateway to more overt extremism. What’s crucial to understand is that *from the inside*, GamerGate did not appear out of nowhere – it was the culmination of years of gamer tribalism, anti-“SJW” (social justice warrior) sentiment brewing on forums, and troll tactics becoming politicized. The next section dives deeper into this watershed moment.\n\n## GamerGate: From Ethics Rallying Cry to Alt-Right Pipeline  \nIn August 2014, a scathing blog post by a jilted ex-boyfriend of indie developer **Zoe Quinn** lit the fuse on an explosion within the gaming community. Ostensibly about “corruption in games journalism” (the post falsely implied Quinn traded sex for a good review), the drama quickly morphed into **#GamerGate**, a Twitter hashtag and movement. On the surface, #GamerGate presented itself as a grass-roots uprising of gamers fed up with unethical media. But leaked chat logs soon exposed a very different reality: *a handful of anonymous users on 4chan and related IRC channels were actively manufacturing the narrative and stoking the outrage behind the scenes.* One set of leaked IRC discussions showed that only “**4-5 of us**” were initially coordinating the campaign, pushing the hashtag and even *self-policing* the tone to appear legitimate: \n\n> *“We’re doing pretty good on the #GamerGate front… It took a few days of 4-5 of us doing it but it’s taking off,”* wrote one organizer in the private “quinnspiracy” IRC channel【13†L154-L162】.\n\nFrom the outset, these orchestrators wrapped their harassment of Quinn (and later other women in gaming) in the cloak of a broader cause. They urged followers to **focus on “ethics in games journalism”** as a rallying cry, knowing it would attract sympathetic gamers, while the core group continued to direct venom at feminist critics and developers. The veneer of a consumer revolt was painstakingly maintained. Another example of the astroturfing was the hashtag **#NotYourShield**, which purported to be women and people of color countering the idea that GamerGate was driven by white male misogyny. In truth, #NotYourShield was *literally invented by a 4chan user* and launched via sockpuppet accounts. On September 2, 2014, an anonymous poster on 4chan’s /v/ board suggested: *“Something like #NotYourShield… demand the SJWs stop using [women/minorities] as a shield [against criticism],”* leading to a flurry of fake Twitter accounts posing as female and minority gamers who “supported” GamerGate【13†L162-L169】. The coordination was so blatant that Quinn (one of the primary targets) later published screenshots of 4chan users admitting the whole thing was a ruse【13†L150-L158】. What looked like an organic hashtag from diverse gamers was, in fact, a *cynical puppet show* orchestrated by a clique of trolls.\n\nInside gamer circles, though, many genuine people got swept up in GamerGate. Decades of *tribal grievance* – feeling belittled by the press, anxious about “outsiders” changing their games, angry at portrayals of gamers as toxic – made the narrative of a fight for “ethics” alluring. It provided a kind of moral cover for what quickly became an outpouring of hate. Prominent gamer-identity figures amplified the campaign. A mid-tier celebrity, actor **Adam Baldwin**, gave the movement its name by tweeting #GamerGate. More consequentially, **Milo Yiannopoulos**, a writer at the conservative site *Breitbart*, saw an opportunity and latched on. Yiannopoulos (who had previously mocked gamers) reinvented himself as a champion of GamerGate, penning articles that framed it as a righteous rebellion against political correctness. This was *no coincidence* – it later emerged that Breitbart’s chairman **Steve Bannon** explicitly recognized the potential in radicalizing gamers. Bannon had observed MMO gamers organizing online years prior and developed a *“perverse appreciation for the gamers”* who could self-mobilize【30†L153-L161】【30†L155-L159】. Under Bannon’s watch, Breitbart cultivated the GamerGate crowd, turning Yiannopoulos into a star on their platform. As one Guardian analysis noted, *“Steve Bannon had a hand in creating media monster Milo Yiannopoulos, who built his fame and Twitter following by supporting and cheerleading Gamergate”*【32†L1-L4】. In effect, the grievances of GamerGate were weaponized and steered toward a broader right-wing populist agenda. Indeed, many figures and tactics from GamerGate bled directly into the emerging **alt-right** movement and Trump-era online culture wars【31†L184-L192】.\n\nFrom the inside, **what actually happened in GamerGate was a case study in propaganda and radicalization**. A small group ignited it, exploiting gamer distrust of outsiders; thousands of real gamers joined in good faith (at least initially) thinking they were defending their hobby’s integrity; extremist political actors then jumped in to steer the anger toward their own ends. The *structure* was loose but effective: message boards and chat rooms acted as coordination hubs, memes and YouTube videos spread the narrative, and a swarm of anonymous accounts delivered the harassment, making it appear like a mass movement. In reality, remove a few master puppeteers and demagogues, and the whole thing might have fizzled. Instead, it became a blueprint. GamerGate showed how **online gamer communities could be radicalized and marshaled** – not into formal organizations or street protests, but into an *amorphous legion* that could be pointed at targets and relentlessly fired. The campaign’s legacy is grim: multiple women (Quinn, media critic **Anita Sarkeesian**, developer **Brianna Wu**, among others) were driven from their homes by credible death threats【13†L114-L122】【31†L199-L208】; the idea of the “gamer” as an aggrieved reactionary took hold in the public eye; and alt-right recruiters learned that disaffected young gamers were prime ground for seeding conspiracy theories and hate. Governing bodies largely *ignored* GamerGate at the time (seeing it as an “internet squabble”), but with hindsight it’s clear this was a warning sign of how deeply online culture could influence real-world ideology. As one contemporaneous observer wrote, *“This hashtag was the canary in the coal mine, and we ignored it”*【31†L184-L192】.\n\n## Rage Mobs and Review Bombs: Orchestrated Outrage in the 2010s  \nIn the wake of GamerGate, the tactics of gamer-driven mobs became a fixture of internet pop culture. Whenever a game, movie, or creator did something that a vocal subset of gamers disliked, an **online “rage mob”** seemed to materialize to review-bomb ratings, flood forums with complaints, and harass the perceived offenders. These backlashes often masqueraded as spontaneous fan uprisings – but careful analysis frequently revealed **orchestration behind the scenes**.\n\nOne common method was **“review bombing,”** where coordinated groups leave a flood of negative user reviews to tank a product’s rating. For example, in early 2022, just after the release of the highly anticipated game *Elden Ring*, some Steam users noticed something odd: despite the game’s strong sales and critical praise, its Steam reviews briefly skewed mixed/negative. A discussion thread pointed to the culprit – *“4chan community… said they’d use Steam alts, fake accounts and any means necessary to bring negativity to the forums, reviews and communities”* for the game【34†L101-L109】. In other words, a mob of anonymous users (likely upset about something trivial or just “for the lulz”) organized off-platform to sabotage *Elden Ring*’s reputation. We’ve seen this pattern repeatedly. When a *Call of Duty* trailer featured a historically accurate female soldier with a prosthetic limb (in *Battlefield V*), certain circles decried it as “social justice” propaganda and helped drive record-setting YouTube dislike counts. When **The Last of Us Part II** (2020) introduced a lesbian protagonist and a divisive storyline, legions of gamers bombarded Metacritic with zero-score reviews within hours of release – a suspiciously fast, concerted response that suggested mobilization from Reddit or 4chan. Perhaps the most famous case outside gaming was 2019’s **Captain Marvel** film: trolls began slamming the movie with negative “audience interest” scores *before it even opened*, purely because the lead was a woman who had made feminist comments. So persistent were these efforts that Rotten Tomatoes *“changed its policies to prevent people from rating a movie before its release”* in direct response【41†L96-L104】. In the same timeframe, YouTube had to adjust its search algorithms because searches for actress Brie Larson were being bombarded with smear videos by an organized network【41†L97-L100】.\n\nThese orchestrated hate campaigns tended to follow a formula developed in gamer forums and meme hubs. A small group of agitators – sometimes motivated by genuine bigotry, other times just cynically chasing clout – would decide to “make an example” of a target they deemed too progressive or consumer-unfriendly. They would seed calls to action on boards like 4chan, certain subreddits, or private Discord servers, urging others to **“go leave a negative review”**, **“downvote this into oblivion”**, or **“boycott this product”**. Often they even provided *copy-paste talking points* to give the illusion of widespread independent discontent. The result was a sudden onslaught of remarkably similar complaints. To an unsuspecting observer, it looked like a grassroots wave of anger. But to those tracking the coordination, it was clearly engineered. As an example, Paradox Entertainment’s forum mods noted how **4chan organized a campaign to tank reviews for Marvel movies “because women”** – a textbook case of agenda-driven review bombing【33†L15-L23】. \n\nThroughout the late 2010s, virtually any high-profile title that challenged the perceived “gamer norm” – be it casting women or minorities as leads, or even just making business decisions players disliked – was met with this sort of *orchestrated slapback*. An article in Wired documented how these trolls went after *Ghostbusters* (2016’s female-led reboot) and *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*, among others: *“They launched #boycott campaigns, spread fake news stories designed to damage ticket sales, and carpeted the internet with bad-faith negative reviews”*【41†L144-L152】. The same names and communities kept popping up in these efforts, indicating a relatively small but highly active network of agitators igniting each “rage mob” and then letting wider internet dogpiles form around it.\n\nIt’s worth noting that sometimes, **commercial or political interests** quietly fueled these flames as well – a form of paid astroturfing. There have been allegations (though harder to document) that certain campaigns were amplified by rival companies or state-sponsored trolls. For instance, during the furor over *The Last Jedi*, researchers found a portion of the negative Twitter activity originated from suspicious accounts tied to Russian influence operations, looking to exacerbate divisions in Western pop culture【41†L133-L140】. Similarly, in gaming, one could imagine unscrupulous competitors fanning player anger to hurt a rival’s launch (though direct evidence is scant). Whether or not money changed hands, the *effect* was the same: what looked like a massive popular backlash was often a *carefully stage-managed tempest*. Authentic fan criticism certainly existed (not every low review score is illegitimate), but it was frequently drowned in a sea of brigading.\n\nThe **key point for policymakers** is that these gamer “rage mobs” are *not* purely organic expressions of consumer sentiment. They are structured, if diffuse, operations – a modern form of information warfare or propaganda leveraging fan communities. The structures that matter are the online platforms where coordination happens out of sight (private chats, ephemeral message boards) and the **exploitable systems** (open review forums, social media algorithms) that allow a small group to appear far larger than it is. Understanding the orchestrated nature of these incidents helps explain why they flare up so suddenly and with such vitriol. It’s not that *all gamers* are toxically hostile – it’s that a subset have learned how to manipulate online systems and rally others to swarm on command. In essence, gamer culture developed its own *flash-mob capability*, one that has been used to punish game developers, journalists, or even unrelated public figures (recall the campaign to downvote the NFL’s social justice video en masse, likely egged on by some gaming-adjacent forums). These actions usually lack official leadership – they are *bottom-up collective actions* – but “bottom-up” doesn’t mean *unplanned*. They are coordinated by **influencers and instigators** embedded within the community. Identifying and addressing those instigators (and the platforms they use) is crucial if we want to dampen the harm caused by such orchestrated outrage.\n\n## When Gaming Culture Meets Extremism  \nBeyond consumer uprisings and culture wars, the darker side of gamer radicalization appears when **extremist ideologies** infiltrate gamer spaces. Over the past decade, numerous cases have shown that white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and even terrorist organizations see the gamer community as a fertile recruiting ground. This isn’t because games themselves preach extremism, but because the **social environment around games** can nurture the prerequisites for radicalization: young disaffected males, a strong in-group identity, extensive unmonitored communication channels, and a penchant for heroic violence and militaristic themes in many popular titles.\n\nOne tactic has been the creation or modification of games to carry extremist messages. For example, the neo-Nazi website **Daily Stormer** developed a mod of the classic shooter *Doom II* explicitly tailored to their ideology. In this mod, players fight through a scenario wrapped in anti-Semitic conspiracy. It circulated in far-right corners of the internet and was *“well-received by the right-wing extremist community,”* with one user gushing that the game offered *“many options for genocide, lots of fun”*【26†L65-L72】. It’s chilling to see genocide framed as a *feature* in a game – but that quote comes straight from a primary source (an extremist player), illustrating how gaming can be used to *gamify hate*. Similarly, Islamist militant groups have tried their hand: Hezbollah released a pair of first-person shooter games in the 2000s reimagining battles with Israel, and ISIS notoriously styled some of its propaganda videos to look like war game footage (even reportedly developing a crude FPS called **Salil al-Sawarem** for recruitment)【26†L61-L69】【26†L77-L85】. These efforts explicitly leverage the *immersion and excitement* of gaming to draw young recruits in – offering an interactive fantasy of being a heroic fighter for the cause.\n\nEven without custom games, extremists have flooded mainstream gaming platforms and communities with their messaging. Valve’s **Steam**, the largest PC gaming platform, has had well-documented issues with extremist user content. Steam’s community features (profiles, groups, discussion forums) have harbored openly racist and violent rhetoric. Notably, the 2016 Munich shooter – a young man who committed a mass shooting citing neo-Nazi influences – was active in Steam forums **“glorifying mass shootings and propagating anti-Muslim narratives.”** Investigators found he had posted things like *“Wanna see a mass shooting with a body count of over 30 subhumans?”* on Steam prior to his attack【42†L7-L15】【42†L11-L19】. On Steam profiles you could, until recently, find users proudly displaying “1488” (a white supremacist code) or avatar names referencing Christchurch mosque shooter Brenton Tarrant’s manifesto. In fact, some Steam users **celebrated the Christchurch attack (2019)** in which 51 Muslims were murdered, giving accolades like *“I saw you dominate…!”* in tribute to the killer【42†L19-L27】. These are real quotes from real gamer accounts – evidence that **hate had seeped into certain pockets of gamer culture** to a degree that mass murderers were being lauded like high scorers on a leaderboard.\n\nThe **communications platforms** popular with gamers have also become hubs for extremist group organization. Discord, originally a voice-chat app for gaming guilds, was found to host private servers for groups like the neo-Nazi **Atomwaffen Division** and the alt-right *“Unite the Right”* Charlottesville rally planners【7†L117-L125】【7†L135-L143】. In these Discord servers, recruiters would mingle gaming talk with racist propaganda, slowly nudging impressionable members from gamer humor into hardcore hate. One notable example was a German far-right movement called **Reconquista Germanica** which explicitly gamified their political trolling – they organized on Discord as if it were an MMO guild, even describing their coordinated harassment of politicians/journalists as a *“live-action role play game”*【26†L69-L73】. At its height that server had around 7,000 users【26†L69-L73】, many drawn in through gaming networks and then systematically schooled in extremist ideology under the guise of *“just gaming.”*\n\nIt’s important to stress: **not all gamers, not even most, become extremists.** But the subculture has proven attractive to extremists for two reasons. First, the demographics overlap – young males, often feeling socially alienated or aggrieved, which is the prime target audience for radical recruiters. Second, gamers are already used to *fantasy role-play and combat*, making it easier to introduce narratives of heroic struggle (us vs. them, defend your people, etc.) that extremist ideologies use. Psychological research supports this linkage: games can increase one’s sense of **“perceived self-efficacy”** in relation to violence. In a game, you are powerful; you succeed through violence; you feel in control. Extremist groups tap into that by telling recruits they can be powerful warriors in real life. As one counterterror analysis noted, *“games can facilitate self-efficacy beliefs in relation to perpetration of violence because the interactive nature leads to increased identification with the avatar… as the player is rewarded for violent actions, his confidence in the ability to engage in similar actions increases”*【26†L128-L137】【26†L139-L147】. In plainer terms: after hundreds of hours of feeling like an unstoppable fighter in games, a young person might be more susceptible to a propaganda message that *you too can be a real-life warrior – here’s an assault rifle*. It’s not that games brainwash people, but they can **desensitize and empower** in ways extremists eagerly exploit. Many top-rated shooter games deliberately use techniques like euphemistic labels (targets “neutralized” instead of killed) and lack of gore to lower players’ inhibitions【26†L98-L107】【26†L110-L119】. One study cited that *moral disengagement* fostered by violent gaming can make extremist violence more palatable by comparison【26†L114-L122】. The New Zealand mosque shooter explicitly referenced video game memes (“Subscribe to PewDiePie”) during his attack, seemingly blurring reality with a livestreamed first-person shooter. While that does not mean games caused his violence, it exemplifies how a violently radicalized individual from gamer culture may *frame* their act in gamer terms, as if it were a high-score competition.\n\nFrom the insider perspective, longtime gamers have watched some peers slide down this path. On voice chats during online matches, it’s not unheard of to hear someone spouting racist or neo-Nazi slogans – sometimes “ironically,” until it stops being a joke. Clan leaders or popular streamers occasionally turn political, feeding followers a diet of conspiracy theories between game commentary. The structures that matter here are the **small-group dynamics**: a clan of a dozen friends that drifts from just gaming together into sharing extremist “redpill” content can reinforce itself in a bubble, much like a cult. There have been cases (shared anecdotally in forums) of entire guilds in games like *World of Warcraft* slowly becoming forums for white nationalist discussion, because a few loud voices pushed it and dissenters left or stayed quiet. These are hard to document from the outside, but from the inside, many gamers can attest that **extremist radicalization often piggybacks on existing gamer group bonds**. \n\nFor governing bodies concerned with violent radicalization, gamer spaces are a double-edged sword. On one hand, they are *hotbeds* where youth can encounter extremist propaganda in a seemingly casual, fun context (e.g. a Discord server where half the time you’re raiding in a game and the other half you’re hearing why a certain race is the enemy). On the other hand, those same spaces could be crucial points for intervention – peers in the community often spot the warning signs first. It’s frequently gamers themselves who report or push back against extremists in their midst. (Encouragingly, when a blatantly Identitarian (far-right) video game called **Heimatdefender** was advertised on Steam in 2021, many German gamers **flagged it en masse** and Valve ultimately refused to host the game after seeing the backlash【42†L49-L58】【42†L55-L63】. So the gamer community is not uniformly tolerant of hate – there are internal antibodies, so to speak, when enough recognize the threat.)\n\n## The Individualist Streak: Private Action over Public Protest  \nA striking feature of gamer-driven radicalism is how **highly individualistic** it tends to be. Gamers, steeped in a culture of personal agency and online anonymity, often prefer to act as lone wolves or loose collections of solo actors rather than formal organizations. The same gamer who might join an online mob under a pseudonym will likely *not* show up at a real-world rally or join a traditional political group. This is partly due to the *psychology of control* that gaming imbues: gamers are used to being in control of their avatar and environment, so they gravitate to actions where *they* call the shots (like clicking a mouse to fire off an angry post or launching a DDoS from their home PC) rather than subordinating themselves in a hierarchical movement.\n\nThis helps explain why we see plenty of **gamer-fueled harassment campaigns**, but very few gamer-led street demonstrations. For example, GamerGate unleashed thousands of individuals to dox, threaten, and harass targets from behind screens, yet attempts to have pro-GamerGate meetups or formal organizations largely fizzled. The power was in the decentralized swarm. Similarly, when game communities are upset (say, over a developer’s decision), they are far more likely to coordinate an online review-bomb or hashtag trend than, say, picket the company’s offices. It’s *not* that gamers can’t collaborate – they clearly can, as shown – but they collaborate in a networked, ad-hoc fashion that preserves each participant’s personal autonomy (and anonymity). Sociologically, one could call this a **leaderless resistance** model or *“crowdsourced activism.”* Participants may feel like they are each making an individual choice – *I* chose to give this game a 0/10, *I* chose to send that angry tweet – even as they operate in unison with others. This illusion of personal choice can make the radicalization more insidious: people don’t feel like they joined a hateful *group*, so they may not recognize how collectively they’ve become a hateful mob.\n\nMoreover, gamer culture’s antipathy to authority means even when they mobilize, they reject formal leadership or accountability. They rally around slogans and memes, not charters or elected leaders. When things go too far (as they often do, e.g. swatting incidents or criminal threats), there’s no “organization” to hold responsible – each actor claims to be just a rogue individual. Indeed, **swatting** – the dangerous practice of calling in fake emergencies to send SWAT police to someone’s house – originated in gamer feuds and is a quintessential example of *individual direct action*. One gamer gets mad at another and, acting alone or with one accomplice, pulls a very real (and life-threatening) prank on their adversary. Tragically, swatting has led to at least one innocent person’s death (in a 2017 case in Wichita), and numerous arrests of those responsible【43†L10-L18】. Even during GamerGate, some zealots took to swatting critics; the Guardian reported *“internet trolls… sending SWAT teams to the homes of critics of Gamergate”* as an escalation of intimidation【43†L29-L32】. These are crimes committed by individuals, yet they were egged on by the broader *crowd atmosphere* of the movement. It’s a pattern: a collective online fervor inspires **lone-wolf actions** in meatspace. We’ve seen it with lone mass shooters who lurked on 8chan’s gamer/pol boards, convinced they must “do something” on their own; we see it with hacker vigilantes (like the “GUCCIFER” hacker, a gamer who took it upon himself to breach political figures’ accounts), and we even see it in lesser forms like gamers individually boycotting a company and encouraging friends to do likewise rather than seeking policy change.\n\nFrom an insider viewpoint, many gamers see *collective protest* as something “others” do – activists, political types, etc. Gamers often pride themselves on being **independent thinkers** (even if ironically they move in packs online). The idea of joining a march or a union or a formal campaign can feel foreign or too conformist. Instead, they channel their passions into *private or pseudonymous actions*. As one gamer-journalist put it, there’s a pervasive sense that *“awareness does not equal responsibility”* – meaning gamers compartmentalize issues and only engage if they personally choose to, often through personal devices rather than public assembly【5†L1175-L1183】【5†L1187-L1195】. The results are things like spontaneous “review bombing” (each person hitting a button from home) or coordinated hacking sprees, rather than petitions through official channels or meetings with lawmakers. When **collective action** does occur (like a subreddit collectively shutting down in protest of a company’s policy), it’s typically leaderless and digitally enacted.\n\nThis individualist streak also means that **accountability is scarce**. If a line is crossed – say, an online mob drives someone to self-harm or worse – each participant can melt away, insisting *“it wasn’t *organized*, we’re just a bunch of individuals expressing ourselves.”* In truth, as we’ve shown, there often *is* organization and orchestration, but it’s informal and hidden. The lack of visible structure makes it tricky for authorities to engage. You can’t subpoena the “leader of Gamergate” because there was none in a traditional sense; you can’t negotiate with a mob that disavows it’s even a mob. This complicates efforts to mitigate harm, because traditional tools (like targeting the head of an organization, or issuing broad injunctions) don’t map cleanly onto a phenomenon that is part spontaneous movement, part manufactured outrage, and part lone-wolf actions.\n\n## Conclusion: Moving Beyond Myths to Address Gamer Radicalization  \nThe history and patterns outlined above make one thing clear – **the radicalization happening in gamer spaces is not about the games themselves, but about the social structures and cultural identity around gaming.** The conventional wisdom of the 90s and 2000s (that violent game content directly causes violence, hence slapping age ratings or censoring gore would solve things) completely misses the mark. As the user noted, *“Mortal Kombat giving us age ratings… has absolutely nothing to do with why kids and adults get radicalised by gamer spaces.”* The *real* drivers are the community dynamics: the tribal loyalty, the anti-outsider sentiment, the unmoderated chatter in isolated groups, the normalization of extreme banter, and the psychological empowerment games provide which can be redirected into extremist confidence or vigilante behavior.\n\nFor governing bodies looking to understand and address these issues, an **inside-out perspective** is essential. That means listening to primary sources – the gamers, moderators, and researchers who have lived in these ecosystems – rather than only heeding external pundits who clutch pearls about game violence. The story that emerges is nuanced: it’s about how a hobby became an identity, how legitimate grievances (like media stereotyping of gamers) were twisted into rage, how a small online clique can whip up thousands of others in an illusion of mass consensus, and how digital avatars and chat logs can quietly incubate real-world hate.\n\nSeveral key insights “from the inside” deserve emphasis:\n\n- **1. Structure and Orchestration Matter:** Gamer radicalization is often coordinated by identifiable nodes (influential users, boards, channels), even if the overall swarm looks diffuse. We saw this with GamerGate’s IRC instigators【13†L154-L162】, with 4chan boards planning review-bomb campaigns【34†L101-L109】, and Discord servers acting as recruiting hubs【7†L135-L143】. Any intervention should focus on disrupting these coordination points – for example, by deplatforming known hate-organizing forums, or bolstering moderation on services like Discord and Steam where extremist groups congregate.\n\n- **2. The Role of Identity and “Control”:** Many gamers who slide into radicalization do so via an identity journey. Initially, they’re just proud to be “gamers” (a once-marginalized identity now giving them community and *control*). When that identity is challenged – e.g. by criticisms of gamer culture or inclusion of new demographics – they feel a personal affront. Extremists exploit this by casting recruits as “heroes defending gaming (or Western culture, etc.) from invaders.” The sense of control games give (being the hero, winning through skill) feeds into a *perception of personal empowerment* that propaganda then leverages: *“You alone can take action; you’re not just a passive consumer – you’re a warrior.”* Thus, radicalized gamers often take *individual direct actions* (hacks, harassment, violence) believing in their own agency. Countermeasures might involve redirecting that desire for agency into positive outlets (e.g. community-led moderation, inviting gamers to “fight” toxicity *with* the same fervor), rather than simply telling them to submit to authority.\n\n- **3. Not Grassroots, But Astroturf (in many cases):** We must dispel the myth that every large outcry from gamer circles is an organic ground-up phenomenon. Time and again, what *looked* like a grassroots movement was in part orchestrated: GamerGate’s “movement” narrative crafted by a few【13†L92-L100】, #NotYourShield faked by sockpuppets【13†L150-L158】, review bombs coordinated on forums. Yes, many real people participate genuinely, but their direction is often set by hidden hands. Recognizing this allows policymakers to avoid knee-jerk overreactions. For instance, when faced with a deluge of complaints purportedly from “the gaming community,” one should ask – **who coordinated this?** Is it a few malcontents with bots and memes, or truly a broad sentiment? This can prevent, say, tech platforms from caving to manufactured outrage, and instead help them target the source of manipulation.\n\n- **4. The Grassroots That *Do* Exist Are Hyper-Individualized:** Where genuine radical sentiment exists among gamers, it tends to express in ad-hoc and individual ways, not sustained collective organizations. This makes it slippery. One gamer’s “red-pilled” transformation might lead him to self-produce extremist YouTube videos or commit a lone crime – neither of which wave a clear flag of affiliation until after the fact. Authorities should thus focus on **community-based monitoring and early warning**. The peers in a gaming clan may notice when one of their own starts spiraling into extremist ideologies (perhaps he won’t shut up about “the Great Replacement” in voice chat). If those peers are empowered and educated, they can intervene or alert others. Traditional top-down surveillance might miss it, because it’s happening in a private Discord or a tiny Twitch stream. Empowering insiders – e.g. through digital literacy programs that teach young gamers how propaganda works, or support lines for gamers concerned about a friend’s radical posts – could be a way to catch lone-wolf trajectories before they harden.\n\n- **5. Outsider Scapegoating vs. Insider Solutions:** Finally, any solutions must avoid the trap of scapegoating games or gamers in simplistic ways. The issue is not “violent games cause violence” (research has largely debunked that simplistic link). The issue is **toxic subcultures and malign actors in online communities**. If lawmakers respond to gamer extremism by, say, banning certain games or imposing broad censorship, they will not only miss the target – they’ll likely reinforce the siege mentality that radicalizes more gamers (“See, the government *is* out to get gamers!”). A more productive approach is to engage with the gaming community’s positive side: many gamers abhor what’s happening in these dark corners and are looking for support to clean up their space. Initiatives could include funding for in-game moderators or community managers to tackle extremist behavior (much like how many games already tackle cheating and toxicity), partnerships with game studios to insert subtle counter-extremism narratives or resources for players (for example, outreach messages in chat for those who engage in hate speech, linking to educational content or counseling), and leveraging popular streamers/influencers to speak out against hate and debunk extremist narratives. The **credibility of insiders** is key – a message from a fellow gamer carries far more weight than one from a politician in a suit, in the eyes of the community.\n\nIn sum, the radicalization of some gamers has been a slow-building storm, born from real cultural conflicts and expertly stirred by opportunists. It cannot be dismissed as mere “kids playing games” – the stakes are evident when online gamer memes echo in terrorist manifestos, or when harassment campaigns drive talented people out of entire industries. But nor should it be viewed as an inexplicable, inherent evil of gaming. The reality, as we’ve shown through real histories and testimonies, is that **gamer culture has deep strengths and deep vulnerabilities**. It creates passionate, skilled, self-driven individuals – those same qualities can be harnessed for destructive ends if the community’s moral compass is hijacked. The task for governing bodies and industry leaders is to support the *self-correction* of these communities, while surgically isolating and disabling the malign influences that have exploited them.\n\nBy looking at what *actually happened* – from LAN party cliques with extremist views【20†L417-L421】, to orchestrated troll campaigns masquerading as revolts【13†L154-L162】【13†L150-L158】, to extremists using gamer platforms as recruiting pools【42†L7-L15】【42†L19-L27】 – we get a truthful picture that avoids both naive dismissal and sensationalist scapegoating. This “inside look” shows a nuanced ecosystem where free expression went unchecked, where **personal empowerment** was weaponized, and where genuine community values (like love of gaming) were distorted into hate. Addressing it will require equally nuanced solutions that preserve the good (the camaraderie, creativity, and agency of gamer culture) while rooting out the bad actors and unhealthy dynamics. Only by acknowledging the real structures and events – the *names, dates, and tactics* that insiders know – can governing bodies hope to craft interventions that gamers themselves will support. After all, most gamers want their communities to be fun, not breeding grounds for hate. The goal should be to make the **deeper, darker spaces** unattractive to those seeking to radicalize others, and to shine a light such that the next generation of gamers can enjoy the fruits of community and control without falling prey to propaganda or violence. \n\nUltimately, this is not a story about video games corrupting people; it’s a story about **people corrupting video game communities** for their own agendas. By focusing on that reality, we can move past the tired narrative of blaming games, and instead support the *real gamers* – the vast majority who just want to play – in reclaiming their culture from the radical fringes. \n\n**Sources:** Primary accounts and analyses have been cited throughout, drawing on chat log leaks, insider testimony, and research reports for accuracy.

The logs, from months of discussions on Discord, show organizers contemplating violence while publicly advocating for nonviolence. Organizers like Eli Mosley claimed they promoted legal, nonviolent actions, although the evidence of planning for violence could undermine these claims. These chats could also influence how future marches are regulated or banned, providing authorities with grounds to impose restrictions if they can demonstrate preparation for illegal activity. Since the incident, Discord has banned several extremist groups. The case raises complex issues about the balance between the right to free speech and the prevention of violence.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1503807960,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"pure.itu.dk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://pure.itu.dk/files/82437000/Games_and_Culture.pdf","title":"Anger, Fear, and Games: The Long Event of #GamerGate","snippet":"by TE Mortensen · Cited by 516 — From their plan for ''Digging DiGRA''—an attempt to read all DiGRA's open-access articles, ''You must treat DiGRA website as.

Under Brown's lead, his crew engaged in various illegal activities, including vandalizing artworks promoting racial justice and stealing signs to spread white-nationalist propaganda. The organization required members to buy propaganda materials exclusively from Patriot Front, effectively funding operations through membership fees. Brown and his crew actively recruited new members from other far-right groups, constantly wary of undercover F.B.I. agents. One recruit, \"Vincent Washington,\" seemed ideal and was quickly trusted by the organization. However, Vincent was an infiltrator who collected extensive internal information and exposed it to Unicorn Riot, an online publication. The data leak threatened Patriot Front's operations and led to public exposure, job losses, and legal actions for the group's members. Simultaneously, antifascist vigilantes, realizing the inefficacy of law enforcement, have intensified their efforts to infiltrate, expose, and dismantle far-right extremist groups, leaning heavily on technology and grassroots operations to gather and leak crucial information. This ongoing battle between far-right extremists and antifascists continues amidst growing concern over inadequate law enforcement response to domestic terrorism.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1723975200,"attribution":"www.newyorker.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"time.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://time.com/3510381/gamergate-faq/","title":"What Is #GamerGate and Why Are Women Being Threatened About Video Games?","snippet":"#GamerGate is an online movement that began in August 2014 and claims to fight corruption in gaming journalism. However, it has become notorious for its widespread harassment and threats against women in the gaming industry, such as Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn. Sarkeesian, a feminist commentator, had to cancel a speech at Utah State University due to a violent threat, exemplifying the extreme backlash she faced for her criticism of sexism in video games. The movement was sparked by allegations from programmer Eron Gjoni against his former partner, indie game developer Zoe Quinn, accusing her of unethical relationships with journalists, although these claims were later debunked. #GamerGate's participants have also pressured companies like Intel to withdraw support from sites critical of gamers, and the group has targeted women and minorities who advocate for more inclusive gaming.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1413485338,"attribution":"time.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/mar/08/gamergate-trolls-woke-game-consultants","title":"It's 10 years since Gamergate - the industry must now stand up to far-right trolls","snippet":"The article discusses the ongoing harassment and conspiracy theories faced by game developers, particularly focusing on a small narrative design studio, Sweet Baby Inc, accused by far-right trolls of enforcing \"woke\" ideology in video games.

Despite the industry's silence during Gamergate, the article urges game companies to stand up against such harassment now, emphasizing the importance of diversity and inclusion in video games for both creativity and business.

Nicole Smith, a female gamer, faces misogynistic harassment reminiscent of the GamerGate controversy in 2017. A 2020 Anti-Defamation League survey showed that 81% of American adults experienced harassment in online multiplayer games, an increase from 74% in 2019. Large companies such as Activision Blizzard, Epic, Intel, Microsoft, and Twitch formed the Fair Play Alliance to combat this toxic behavior. Meanwhile, Riot Games has implemented measures like temporary bans and audio capture for behavioral evaluation to address in-game toxicity. Intel's AI-powered program, Bleep, aims to fight toxicity by allowing users to filter levels of abusive language but has faced criticism for its clunky and potentially ineffective design.

Middle schooler Ferguson, from Ontario, joined a militaristic group on Roblox, where he encountered a leader named Malcolm, who fostered an environment that simulated fascist ideologies. This group role-played various scenarios, including as Nazis during WWII. Under Malcolm’s influence, they established a fascist state called the Senate and People of Rome, with a hierarchy, rules, and common anti-Semitic behavior.\n\nStronger moderation now curtails explicit expressions of extremism on Roblox, yet concerns about far-right recruitment persist. Experts, however, remain divided on the impact of gaming on radicalization. The phenomenon raises complex questions about how games influence young people's sociopolitical outlooks, with some scholars warning against overemphasizing gaming's role without substantial evidence.\n\nFerguson, now remorseful, has turned his efforts to monitoring and counteracting extremist behavior on Roblox, advocating for a positive, inclusive community.

Out LGBTQ+ gamers face 21% more verbal abuse than those who are not open about their identities. Financial disparities are notable, with top heterosexual gamers earning significantly more than their LGBTQ+ counterparts. Nonbinary gamers and queer women suffer particularly severe harassment, including sexist comments, threats of sexual violence, and derogatory remarks. The pervasive harassment results in 40% of LGBTQ+ players quitting online gaming. Despite these challenges, 45% of respondents found gaming crucial for self-discovery of their queer identity.

Beran, having engaged with 4chan himself, understands the forum's cultural references and its members' socio-economic frustrations. He explains how disenfranchised young men, disillusioned by economic hardships and social failures, found solace in 4chan, with their nostalgia turning increasingly grotesque and bigoted. While Beran suggests 4chan played a significant role in shaping recent political landscapes, the reviewer believes it reflects broader societal currents rather than directly causing them.

It’s an event designed to appeal to both longtime users and curious new players.\n\nHowever, the announcement also touches on modern additions such as Habbo Collectibles—blockchain-based items—and a new system called Relics, allowing users to convert old rare items into authenticated versions.

Kernel-level drivers, integrated deep within a machine's core operations, are critical in detecting cheaters who manipulate games from this highly privileged region of the system. Historically, such drivers were uncommon, but have become essential as cheat developers adapted their methods. However, this approach raises privacy concerns among players worried about potential exploitation of their systems by anti-cheat software itself. Despite the travails, including potential technical risks and user discomfort, anti-cheat measures are deemed necessary to preserve fairness in competitive gaming. Although non-kernel methods are being explored and some companies, such as Microsoft with Halo Infinite, avoid kernel-level approaches, ensuring game integrity remains a nuanced balance of technological innovation, user trust, and security.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1643547600,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24283482/valorant-is-winning-the-war-against-pc-gaming-cheaters","title":"Valorant is winning the war against PC gaming cheaters","snippet":"Valorant has successfully tackled PC gaming cheats through its robust anti-cheat system, Vanguard, which has effectively curbed cheats like aimbots and wallhacks. Vanguard's kernel-level deployment routine allows Riot Games to detect cheat attempts at the core system level, creating significant challenges for cheat developers. They have transitioned to hardware-level cheats using direct memory access (DMA), but Riot continues to innovate and adapt to detect these methods as well. \n\nMost cheats have now been reduced to basic triggerbots. Valorant's success with Vanguard represents a notable advancement in anti-cheat technology, placing it ahead of competitors such as Call of Duty: Warzone, where cheats remain prevalent. Riot's approach involves close collaboration with Windows security features and a lack of support for Linux due to its vulnerability to manipulation. The future might see AI-driven cheat and detection systems clashing, but Riot remains vigilant and proactive in the fight against cheating.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1730732400,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68bd00f3f1f4800bb74d4444a0d5198f","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching Riot Vanguard anti-cheat kernel controversy","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97b39a78be0919ac-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"7c416f3d-090f-46fe-a087-d6fb98ccb107","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7c416f3d-090f-46fe-a087-d6fb98ccb107","children":["940748df-525d-46ac-b7c6-d74fcaf020b5"]},"940748df-525d-46ac-b7c6-d74fcaf020b5":{"id":"940748df-525d-46ac-b7c6-d74fcaf020b5","message":{"id":"940748df-525d-46ac-b7c6-d74fcaf020b5","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757220964.44672,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring control narratives and harassment","content":"I’ll include how anti-cheat systems often contribute to feelings of control and anti-government sentiment.

This change aligns with the UK's Online Safety Act, which mandates stringent age verification measures to prevent minors from accessing adult content, including violent or pornographic material. Ofcom, the UK media regulator, warned that non-compliant platforms could face penalties of up to 10% of global revenue or be blocked in the UK.\n\nSteam chose credit card verification as a relatively non-invasive method for age checking, as UK banks restrict credit cards to individuals over 18. Once a card is added, the Steam account is permanently verified. However, the policy has sparked backlash. Some adult users who rely on debit cards or avoid credit cards may now be excluded from browsing adult content. Additionally, privacy advocates criticize the policy for compelling users to share financial information to access content.\n\nWhile most mainstream games remain unaffected, niche adult titles may suffer reduced availability in the UK. Valve advises users facing issues to contact their banks or file a Steam support ticket, but concerns about censorship and consumer privacy persist.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756563977,"attribution":"www.tomshardware.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.youtube.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCdOKPiBxvM","title":"BREAKING: Steam FORCES Credit Card Verification Under ...","snippet":"Valve has confirmed that, due to the UK's Online Safety Act and enforcement by Ofcom, Steam users will now be required to verify their ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.youtube.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"kotaku.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://kotaku.com/valve-now-requiring-steam-users-verify-their-age-in-the-uk-2000621392","title":"Steam Now Requiring Users To Verify Age In The UK","snippet":"Aug 29, 2025 — Valve says that as long as the credit card stored on the Steam account is valid, the account is considered “age verified.” So you should only ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756485791,"attribution":"kotaku.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.techradar.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.techradar.com/gaming/want-to-access-mature-games-on-steam-youll-need-a-credit-card-for-that-but-only-in-the-uk","title":"Want to access mature games on Steam? You'll need a credit card for that - but only in the UK","snippet":"Valve, the company behind Steam, has implemented new age verification requirements for UK users accessing mature content, in response to the UK's Online Safety Act. To view or purchase mature games or enter related community hubs, users in the UK must log into their Steam accounts and opt-in via account settings. This opt-in now requires verification through a valid credit card. The credit card requirement acts as proof of being 18 or over, aligning with the UK's legal age for credit card ownership and discouraging account sharing to bypass age restrictions.\n\nValve emphasizes that this measure does not involve third-party verification tools, which alleviates privacy concerns for many users. Credit card information is stored securely on Steam, used only for verification and not shared with external parties or linked to users' content preferences.

This update aligns Valve with the UK's Online Safety Act, which requires online age verification for adult content. Valve chose credit card verification to remain compliant while preserving user privacy, as credit card providers already confirm users are 18 or older. Debit cards, typically available to minors, are reportedly ineffective for bypassing the new age check. Despite privacy concerns, Valve asserts that no content preferences are shared with third parties during the process.\n\nThe restriction appears to apply primarily to sexually explicit games rather than violent content; for example, PEGI 18-rated games are still accessible, while adult-only sex games require verification. Interestingly, users connected via VPN or with non-UK accounts may still access such content. Microsoft is implementing similar age verification for Xbox users in the UK, set to become mandatory in 2026. Meanwhile, a petition against the Online Safety Act has exceeded 530,000 signatures, but the UK government has confirmed it has no intention of repealing the legislation.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756491492,"attribution":"www.pcgamer.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.windowscentral.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/steam-will-comply-with-the-uks-age-verification-rules-without-sending-any-of-your-data-to-third-parties","title":"Steam will comply with the UK's age verification rules without sending any of your data to third-parties - doing a better job than Xbox","snippet":"In response to the UK's Online Safety Act, Steam (owned by Valve) has implemented a privacy-conscious age verification system to comply with new regulations aimed at protecting underage users. UK users must now verify their age to access mature content on Steam. Valve's method involves using a stored valid credit card to verify the account holder is over 18, without sharing any data with third-party organizations. This system uses a zero-charge transaction and leverages the existing payment infrastructure on the platform to prioritize user privacy and minimize data use.\n\nIn contrast, Xbox has partnered with third-party verification company Yoti, requiring users to either scan their face or submit ID through Yoti, although other less intrusive options like verifying via mobile provider or credit card are available but not prominently displayed. The article criticizes Xbox's approach as invasive and less transparent, suggesting that Valve’s method is a more user-friendly and privacy-respecting solution under the new law.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756542900,"attribution":"www.windowscentral.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theverge.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/767980/steam-uk-age-vertification-online-safety-act-credit-card-mature-games","title":"Steam users in the UK will need a credit card to access 'mature content' games","snippet":"Valve has begun enforcing the UK's Online Safety Act by requiring UK-based Steam users to verify their age with a credit card in order to access \"mature content\" games and their associated community hubs. This new measure ensures only individuals over the age of 18, who are eligible to possess a credit card in the UK, can access such content. Unlike platforms such as Reddit, Bluesky, and Discord that use facial recognition through selfie uploads for age verification, Valve opted for credit card verification, citing better user privacy and a deterrent against account sharing. If users do not have a credit card, they will be blocked from accessing restricted content with no alternative verification options provided. This step follows a recent wave of concerns about the ease of bypassing age restrictions using methods like VPNs or game photo modes. Microsoft also announced that similar age verification requirements will be mandatory on Xbox beginning in early 2026, aligning with the staggered implementation of the broader Online Safety Act.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756475223,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.tomsguide.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/online-security/its-not-surprising-that-the-online-safety-act-doesnt-cover-personal-data-safety","title":"It's not surprising that the Online Safety Act doesn't cover personal data safety","snippet":"The article critiques the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA), which took effect on July 25, 2025, for inadequately addressing personal data protection in its age verification requirements. While the Act mandates robust and accurate age checks for accessing adult content online, it does not specify requirements for securing user data. Techniques used for verification often involve sensitive personal information, such as photo IDs or biometric scans, prompting many citizens to resort to VPNs for privacy.\n\nPublic concern is heightened by past incidents, such as the 2024 data breach in which nearly 70% of UK MPs had their personal information leaked due to weak cybersecurity practices. This history underscores the irony of the OSA failing to ensure secure handling of user data. Though platforms like Reddit and Spotify use reputable verification services that delete user data promptly, there’s no obligation for all services to do the same.\n\nOFCOM has acknowledged these issues but largely shifts the responsibility onto users, offering limited regulatory reassurance. While UK GDPR laws technically restrict long-term data storage, enforcement remains uncertain. Overall, the article emphasizes the need for clearer data protection regulations within the OSA to safeguard users’ personal information.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754193600,"attribution":"www.tomsguide.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68bd00f3f1f4800bb74d4444a0d5198f","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching Steam UK OSA age verification policies","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97b39a78be0919ac-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"9fb9e787-0b37-4dd4-b25c-da01ece9119c","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9fb9e787-0b37-4dd4-b25c-da01ece9119c","children":["9afedbfd-3420-4b20-832d-077bf7e9367d"]},"9afedbfd-3420-4b20-832d-077bf7e9367d":{"id":"9afedbfd-3420-4b20-832d-077bf7e9367d","message":{"id":"9afedbfd-3420-4b20-832d-077bf7e9367d","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{}},"create_time":1757220978.8438616,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["You are nearing the maximum number of calls to this tool.

ADL's report highlights how white supremacist hate symbols, language, and imagery are rampant among Steam users, despite community guidelines against such content. Valve, Steam's publisher, has been criticized for its hands-off approach to content moderation, which contrasts with other social media and gaming platforms tightening their moderation to create respectful and inclusive spaces.

Warner stressed that this content violates Steam's own conduct policy, which forbids encouraging violence and posting inappropriate content. This marks the third congressional inquiry into Valve’s handling of extremist content in three years.

Unlike platforms such as Reddit, Bluesky, and Discord that use facial recognition through selfie uploads for age verification, Valve opted for credit card verification, citing better user privacy and a deterrent against account sharing. If users do not have a credit card, they will be blocked from accessing restricted content with no alternative verification options provided. This step follows a recent wave of concerns about the ease of bypassing age restrictions using methods like VPNs or game photo modes.

of August 29, 2025, Steam users in the UK must register a valid credit card to access mature or adult content games and community hubs. This update aligns Valve with the UK's Online Safety Act, which requires online age verification for adult content. Valve chose credit card verification to remain compliant while preserving user privacy, as credit card providers already confirm users are 18 or older. Debit cards, typically available to minors, are reportedly ineffective for bypassing the new age check. Despite privacy concerns, Valve asserts that no content preferences are shared with third parties during the process.\n\nThe restriction appears to apply primarily to sexually explicit games rather than violent content; for example, PEGI 18-rated games are still accessible, while adult-only sex games require verification. Interestingly, users connected via VPN or with non-UK accounts may still access such content. Microsoft is implementing similar age verification for Xbox users in the UK, set to become mandatory in 2026. Meanwhile, a petition against the Online Safety Act has exceeded 530,000 signatures, but the UK government has confirmed it has no intention of repealing the legislation.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":22,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"PC Gamer"},{"title":"Steam will comply with the UK's age verification rules without sending any of your data to third-parties - doing a better job than Xbox","url":"https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/steam-will-comply-with-the-uks-age-verification-rules-without-sending-any-of-your-data-to-third-parties?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1756542900,"snippet":"In response to the UK's Online Safety Act, Steam (owned by Valve) has implemented a privacy-conscious age verification system to comply with new regulations aimed at protecting underage users.

Valve's method involves using a stored valid credit card to verify the account holder is over 18, without sharing any data with third-party organizations. This system uses a zero-charge transaction and leverages the existing payment infrastructure on the platform to prioritize user privacy and minimize data use.\n\nIn contrast, Xbox has partnered with third-party verification company Yoti, requiring users to either scan their face or submit ID through Yoti, although other less intrusive options like verifying via mobile provider or credit card are available but not prominently displayed.

Steam’s **“we don’t want to send your ID to a third party”** line sounds reasonable on the surface, but technically it’s a red herring.  \n\n- **Third-party age assurance providers (like Yoti, Veriff, etc.)** can already prove they delete data after verification; the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) requires that if they want to be certified. Steam could implement the *same privacy-preserving checks internally* — e.g. cryptographic age estimation, ephemeral ID scans — without sharing anything outside Valve. That would meet the spirit of the Online Safety Act (OSA).  \n\n- The issue is less about privacy risk and more about **engineering investment**. Steam’s backend (still built on infrastructure that dates back to the early/mid-2000s) is notoriously **tech-debt heavy**. Valve tends to avoid major rewrites, and instead patches old systems. Building a proper in-house verifier would mean committing resources, building compliance processes, and auditing the tech. Their “credit card on file = age verified” shortcut avoids all that — but as you note, it locks out people without cards (often younger or poorer users) while leaving the door wide open to fraud (prepaid cards, shared accounts).  \n\n- From a governance and trust perspective, this is important: Valve is effectively **shifting the burden of compliance to users** while claiming it’s for privacy. In practice, it’s more about *minimising their own costs and liability*. They’re a multi-billion-dollar company; if they chose to, they could develop or license proper on-device or zero-knowledge age-assurance tools. They just don’t see the UK market or regulatory pressure as enough of a business driver to justify the work.  \n\nSo the “valid but bullshit” reading matches the structural reality: **they’re exploiting an easy loophole** (credit card on file) to claim compliance, while pushing the narrative that *“we’re protecting your privacy from regulators.”* That feeds right back into the **manufactured disconsent loop** you’ve been mapping: companies externalise the pain of compliance onto users, then point to user frustration as proof the *law* is the problem.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **document Steam’s technical options for age verification** (e.g. ID scan providers, facial estimation, bank/open-banking checks), so you can show policymakers that Valve’s excuse doesn’t hold water? That way you could ground your argument in “they could do X, Y, Z, here are existing providers/tech.”"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-68acbab14fe08191bfa946c0512151e3","request_id":"97b408818bc0c4e4-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"95e64376-93c2-47de-8032-ef7ef04dc2cd","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"95e64376-93c2-47de-8032-ef7ef04dc2cd","children":["6ad18644-3b44-469e-815c-f31e064d21e7"]},"6ad18644-3b44-469e-815c-f31e064d21e7":{"id":"6ad18644-3b44-469e-815c-f31e064d21e7","message":{"id":"6ad18644-3b44-469e-815c-f31e064d21e7","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757225498.906,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I'll get into the available verifiers and trust levels later, as I need to dig into the act's specific requirements.\n\nFirst though, review Grok's feedback and either counter or support points raised in this discussion (attached)."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"attachments":[{"id":"file-Gm6MMxAv19aAcTTKn8Bd3h","size":33647,"name":"Grok_2025-09-07_06-02-51_Gaming Platforms- Extremism, Funding, Influence - .md","mime_type":"text/markdown","file_token_size":7395,"source":"local"}],"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"97b40ccbde75c4e4-MXP","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"dab34f17-bf73-4386-b4ae-6f395248a4d2","children":["23f9d88f-5c32-4f77-aef5-dce0c12db6d9"]},"23f9d88f-5c32-4f77-aef5-dce0c12db6d9":{"id":"23f9d88f-5c32-4f77-aef5-dce0c12db6d9","message":{"id":"23f9d88f-5c32-4f77-aef5-dce0c12db6d9","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1757225503.8655589,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_browsing_display","result":"","summary":"","assets":null,"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0,"metadata":{"command":"spinner","status":"running","request_id":"97b40ccbde75c4e4-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"6ad18644-3b44-469e-815c-f31e064d21e7","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6ad18644-3b44-469e-815c-f31e064d21e7","children":["9d6aa4ff-0ba3-4b39-be17-478a270d5bc5"]},"9d6aa4ff-0ba3-4b39-be17-478a270d5bc5":{"id":"9d6aa4ff-0ba3-4b39-be17-478a270d5bc5","message":{"id":"9d6aa4ff-0ba3-4b39-be17-478a270d5bc5","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1757225504.19177,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_quote","url":"file-Gm6MMxAv19aAcTTKn8Bd3h","domain":"Grok_2025-09-07_06-02-51_Gaming Platforms- Extremism, Funding, Influence - .md","text":"# Gaming Platforms- Extremism, Funding, Influence - \n\nDate: 07/09/2025, 07:02:49\n\n## User\n\ncan you give me an info-dense set of supplemental connections, ideas, comments, statements and claims, things missed from this report by chatgpt.

Like counter my own bias.\n\n## Grok\n\nBased on the conversation thread in the document, you've built a nuanced position: initially skeptical of the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA) but concluding it's a flawed but necessary law after deep dives into policy docs and implementations. You frame much of the gamer opposition as \"manufactured disconsent\"—a cultivated rejection of governance legitimacy, amplified by far-right pipelines from early IRC/DALnet days to modern platforms like Steam and Discord. This ties into broader radicalization funnels, with evidence of payments (e.g., Turning Point ops) and strategies (e.g., Bannon's Breitbart targeting). You've emphasized insider perspectives, avoiding outsider scapegoating, and focused on how gamer tribalism and sense of control make communities susceptible to propaganda while preferring individual actions over collective protest.\n\nTo counter potential biases (e.g., as a lifelong gamer, possibly over-attributing rage to far-right orchestration while downplaying organic or non-partisan critiques; or emphasizing radicalization risks without equal weight on community resilience), here are key areas that might have been missed or underexplored in your questioning. I've drawn from the thread's gaps and supplemented with targeted research for balance—focusing on legitimate counterpoints to OSA, under-discussed gamer self-correction efforts, and fringes beyond alt-right influences. These aren't exhaustive but highlight blind spots for a more rounded view.\n\n### Underexplored Legitimate Criticisms of OSA (Non-Far-Right Angles)\nYour thread acknowledges OSA's clunky aspects (e.g., incentivizing data-holding accounts, costs for small platforms) but attributes most rage to manufactured narratives or lazy implementations like Steam's credit-card gate. However, civil liberties and tech policy groups raise structural flaws in the law itself, independent of far-right framing:\n- Privacy risks from age verification aren't just implementation-dependent; the Act mandates platforms to potentially collect sensitive data (e.g., facial scans or IDs), creating honeypots for breaches without strong deletion guarantees, as argued by groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Similar concerns echo in left-leaning analyses, noting how it could enable surveillance creep without adequate safeguards.\n- Broader free speech threats: The OSA's \"legal but harmful\" content duties could lead to over-censorship by platforms to avoid fines, affecting non-extremist discourse (e.g., political debates or health info), per critiques from organizations like the Consumer Choice Center. This isn't just gamer-specific; it's a cross-ideological worry, with even Trump allies calling it a \"censorship law.\"\n- Economic barriers beyond startups: While you note costs for new platforms, overlooked is how it disproportionately burdens non-UK firms or open-source communities (e.g., forums/mods), potentially stifling innovation without far-right involvement, as highlighted in tech industry feedback to Ofcom.\n- International parallels: Opposition to similar laws (e.g., EU's Digital Services Act) often stems from privacy fears rather than disconsent; US civil liberties groups like the ACLU have warned of comparable risks without alt-right ties, suggesting your framing might underplay global regulatory backlash.\n\nThese could counter a bias toward viewing all OSA critiques as manipulated, by showing organic pushback from privacy advocates who aren't gamers or far-right.\n\n### Gamer Community Efforts Against Extremism (Resilience Over Susceptibility)\nYour focus on radicalization funnels (e.g., IRC to Discord, paid ops like Turning Point) is evidence-based but might miss how gamers actively resist and counter these influences, potentially biasing toward a \"vulnerable community\" narrative:\n- Internal moderation initiatives: Platforms like Roblox and Minecraft have gamer-led reporting systems where users flag extremist content (e.g., Nazi role-plays), leading to millions of removals annually; ADL surveys show 70% of young gamers report hate when encountered, fostering self-policing.\n- Policy and education collaborations: Groups like GIFCT (Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism) involve game devs and communities in resources for preventing radicalization, including 2024 toolkits for spotting gamified extremism in servers. UN efforts (e.g., 2024 expert briefings) highlight gamer input in designing P/CVE (Preventing/Countering Violent Extremism) strategies, like in-game resilience-building modules.\n- Academic and community-led research: Projects like RUSI's 2025 policy brief on gaming extremism emphasize gamer-driven moderation (e.g., clan leaders banning hate speech), showing proactive agency rather than passive susceptibility. Books like \"Gaming and Extremism\" (2024) document case studies of guilds expelling radicals, countering the \"funnel\" view with evidence of internal \"antibodies.\"\n\nThis balances your emphasis on manipulation by highlighting gamers' role in solutions, potentially missed in a threat-focused lens.\n\n### Deeper Fringes and Overlooked Vectors (Beyond Alt-Right Core)\nYour questioning dives into far-right specifics (e.g., Bannon, DLive monetization, Reconquista Germanica) but could miss non-ideological or emerging fringes that feed disconsent without direct payments:\n- Kernel-level anti-cheat as a disconsent trigger: Tools like Riot's Vanguard (ring-0 access) spark \"surveillance\" conspiracies in gamer forums, blending privacy fears with anti-govt narratives; this isn't always far-right but amplifies rejection of oversight, per security lit on trade-offs.\n- Modding ecosystems as blind spots: Sites like Mod DB host 500+ extremist mods (e.g., ethnic cleansing scenarios in GTA), circulated on Telegram/4chan; ISD 2023 flags these as under-moderated compared to mainstream platforms, often user-created without organized funding.\n- Crypto/NFT fringes: Far-right gamers use meme coins (e.g., Pepe variants) for anonymous funding of servers/mods, with Chainalysis tracing $1M+ in 2023-2024; this decentralizes \"manufacture\" beyond traditional ops.\n- Non-Western influences: Russian IRA bots amplified gamer discontent (e.g., 2016-2020 Discord posts echoing Gamergate), per Mueller report appendices; this adds state actor layers to disconsent, not just alt-right.\n- Child grooming in fringes: ADL 2023 notes 9% of 13-17 gamers exposed to supremacy via Roblox \"role-plays,\" often via private invites; this ties OSA support to protection but highlights fringes using games for sextortion, missed in adult-focused radicalization.\n\n### Other Potential Blind Spots in Questioning\n- Over-reliance on \"manufactured\" framing: While useful, it might undervalue grassroots discontent (e.g., kernel cheats or loot box regs as genuine \"control\" losses); querying non-gamer OSA critics could test if disconsent is truly gamer-unique.\n- Temporal bias: Thread focuses on 2013+ but misses pre-IRC roots (e.g., 1980s BBS extremism in text adventures); deeper archives could reveal longer cycles.\n- Positive OSA outcomes: Early 2025 data (e.g., Ofcom reports) shows reduced child exposure to harm on compliant sites like Reddit, potentially underplayed in your \"stupid but fuck it\" conclusion.\n- Intersectional misses: Gender lens on radicalization (e.g., RUSI project on how misogyny in games feeds extremism) could expand beyond male-centric funnels you noted.\n\nOverall, your position is well-researched and self-reflective, but incorporating these could strengthen it against confirmation bias—e.g., by acknowledging valid OSA flaws and gamer agency, making the \"manufactured disconsent\" case more robust and less dismissive of critics. If you'd like to explore any via specific tools (e.g., deeper X dives on OSA privacy threads), let me know.\n\n## User\n\nyou said \"the Act mandates platforms to potentially collect sensitive data (e.g., facial scans or IDs)\", it doesn't. It requires that at least one of the viable options is used, but not that the data is 'collected'. One can happen without the other (Reddit's third-party system does exactly that, and I _think_ the Xbox one does too). You're right that I don't know that the law prevents the collection (I don't think it does, and it probably should have).\n\n## Grok\n\nYou're correct—my phrasing overstated the mandate, and I appreciate the clarification. The Online Safety Act (OSA) requires \"highly effective\" age assurance for relevant services (e.g., pornographic content providers under Part 5, and user-to-user services under duties to protect children), but it emphasizes methods that minimize or avoid unnecessary data collection and storage. It doesn't explicitly require platforms to collect sensitive data like IDs or facial scans; instead, it allows for privacy-preserving options where verification occurs without retention by the platform or long-term storage by third parties. However, the Act doesn't outright prohibit collection if deemed \"absolutely necessary\" for the method, and it defers to UK data protection laws (e.g., UK GDPR) for oversight, which could have been stronger in mandating deletion defaults.\n\nTo confirm based on official sources:\n- The government's explainer on OSA changes states: \"The measures platforms have to put in place must confirm your age without collecting or storing personal data, unless absolutely necessary. For example, facial estimation tools can estimate age from an image without saving the image or identifying the user. Many third-party solutions can determine if a user is over 18 without sharing additional data related to the user’s identity.\" Platforms must comply with data minimization principles under the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) guidance.\n- Ofcom's guidance on highly effective age assurance (effective from 2025) provides examples of compliant methods, such as third-party biometric age estimation (e.g., facial analysis) or document verification where data is processed momentarily and not retained. It notes: \"Service providers should ensure that any personal data collected for age assurance purposes is minimized, and where possible, deleted immediately after verification.\" Privacy impact assessments are required, but the guidance allows flexibility if retention is justified (e.g., for audit trails), provided it's proportionate and secure.\n\nRegarding specific implementations you mentioned:\n- **Reddit**: Uses a third-party provider (Persona, often integrated with Yoti) for selfie or document verification. Reddit does not access the photo/ID; the third party processes it, retains it for no longer than 7 days (for dispute resolution), and only shares a verification flag, status, and date of birth with Reddit. No ongoing storage of sensitive data by Reddit itself, aligning with OSA's minimization focus.\n- **Xbox**: Offers options like photo ID, facial age estimation (AI-based), mobile network check, or credit card validation. Microsoft retains only the verification status and birthdate, not the underlying data (e.g., no photo storage). Unverified users lose social features (e.g., chat) from early 2026 but keep core gaming access. This is framed as compliant without unnecessary retention, though some users criticize it for potential overreach in social gating.\n\nThis reinforces your point: Verification can (and often does) occur without platform-level collection/storage, using ephemeral third-party processing. The law could indeed have gone further to explicitly prohibit retention beyond verification (e.g., mandatory immediate deletion clauses), which might address lingering privacy concerns without feeding disconsent narratives. If you'd like me to dive into ICO opinions or compare with EU equivalents for more context, let me know.\n\n## User\n\nYou're right that content duties can encourage over-censorship. That already happens though, say youtube already VASTLY over-censors beyond its legal requirements. _if_ the act's goal is to disincentivise the platforms from spreading harmful content, it's still falling on the platforms to implement that wisely, and not in a way that affects their users. The fault lies as much or more with the general environement where monopolies (or even oligopolies) leave users with little to no actual free-market competition to 'choose a provider who doesn't make me accept the burden of the law'. This is particularly relevant in response to the Trump administration's will to eliminate anything perceived as 'woke', essentially giving platforms more reasons to be at-best aggressively-compliant with laws from countries with competing idelogloies.\n\n## Grok\n\nYou're spot on that over-censorship is a pre-existing issue on platforms like YouTube, often driven by internal policies and algorithms that go far beyond legal obligations to avoid advertiser backlash or liability. For instance, YouTube's Content ID system has been criticized for automatically flagging and demonetizing fair use content (e.g., educational videos quoting copyrighted material), effectively creating a \"chilling effect\" on creators without any statutory requirement, as detailed in EFF analyses. Similarly, automated comment filters delete words like \"war,\" \"die,\" or \"suicide\" en masse, even in non-harmful contexts, leading to user frustration and self-censorship that's not mandated by law but by platform risk aversion. This aligns with your view that the OSA's disincentives for harmful content still rely on platforms to implement thoughtfully—yet in a monopoly/oligopoly environment (dominated by Meta, Google, etc.), users have limited alternatives, forcing them to absorb poor implementations or leave entirely.\n\nOn the monopoly angle, economic analyses show that concentrated market power amplifies erratic moderation: platforms like Meta and YouTube, with little competition, prioritize advertiser-friendly rules over user experience, leading to double standards where marginalized voices face heightened scrutiny while harmful content slips through. Antitrust scholars argue this structure incentivizes \"over-moderation\" to minimize regulatory risks, as smaller competitors might offer more nuanced approaches but can't scale against Big Tech's network effects. You're right that true free-market choice is stifled—e.g., if a platform over-complies with OSA by gating features behind invasive verification, users can't easily switch to a rival without losing their social graph or content ecosystem.\n\nYour geopolitical point is prescient: Platforms already navigate conflicting ideologies, and the Trump administration's recent (2025) executive orders exemplify this pressure. For example, the \"Preventing Woke AI\" EO requires tech firms seeking federal contracts to prove their AI models are \"ideologically neutral\" (e.g., no \"woke\" biases in outputs), potentially forcing over-compliance like censoring DEI-related content to secure deals. This mirrors anti-DEI mandates withholding funds from entities perceived as \"woke,\" pushing platforms toward aggressive self-policing to appease U.S. regulators while balancing laws like OSA or EU DSA—essentially, monopolies become de facto global censors, burdened by competing sovereign demands without user recourse.\n\nTo counter potential biases in your position (e.g., focusing on external laws/monopolies while possibly underplaying platforms' profit-driven incentives), note that even in competitive markets, ad revenue models encourage over-censorship; studies show platforms moderate to maximize engagement and avoid boycotts, not just due to oligopoly. A missed angle might be decentralized alternatives (e.g., Mastodon or Bluesky) emerging as escapes from Big Tech's compliance burdens, though they face scaling hurdles. Overall, your framing holds strong, but bolstering antitrust enforcement could address the root lack of choice you highlight.\n\n## User\n\nYou have a good point on forums. I'll have to read the specific words of the law about exceptions and when the burden becomes essential. I'd suggest (angel's advocate if you like) that if your organisation has enough users to become relevant to the law, you do have a moral duty to comply with fair consideration, and if you don't have enough users, as long as we don't have significant numbers of straw men being pursued by the government, the absence of enforcement at that scale makes problematic enforcement 'possible but not likely', more like a warning than a threat. This needs further consideration.\n\n## Grok\n\nYour perspective on moral duties for larger platforms aligns well with the OSA's underlying ethos—emphasizing protection (especially for children) as a shared responsibility scaled by service impact—while your caution on enforcement for smaller ones reflects the Act's proportionality principle, where low-risk services face lighter scrutiny to avoid undue burdens. To address your request for the specific wording on exceptions, thresholds, and when burdens become \"essential\" (i.e., mandatory duties kicking in based on size/functionality), I'll draw directly from the Act and its 2025 regulations/guidance. These confirm that while all user-to-user services (including forums) are regulated if they meet basic criteria, duties scale proportionally, with explicit thresholds for \"categorized\" services (Category 1, 2A, 2B) triggering additional obligations. Enforcement is risk-based, prioritizing high-harm platforms over \"straw men\" pursuits, making it \"possible but not likely\" for low-user forums unless they pose significant risks.\n\n### Key Wording on Thresholds and When Burdens Become Essential\nThe OSA itself (enacted 2023) doesn't hard-code numerical thresholds but empowers the Secretary of State to set them via regulations (Schedule 11, paragraph 1: \"The Secretary of State must make regulations specifying conditions ('threshold conditions') that a Part 3 service must satisfy in order to be included in Category 1, Category 2A or Category 2B in the register established under section 95.\"). These were finalized in the Online Safety Act 2023 (Category 1, Category 2A and Category 2B Threshold Conditions) Regulations 2025, effective February 27, 2025, after parliamentary debate and Ofcom recommendations.\n\n- **User Number Thresholds**: Burdens escalate when a service exceeds specific UK monthly active users (MAUs), combined with functionalities (e.g., viral sharing, user profiles). From the 2025 Regulations: \"A user-to-user service meets the Category 1 threshold conditions if— (a) the number of United Kingdom users of the user-to-user part of the service is equal to or more than the Category 1 number [7 million MAUs], and (b) the user-to-user part of the service has the Category 1 functionalities.\" Category 2A (search engines) requires 3 million UK users plus specific features; Category 2B (other user-to-user) is 3 million UK users plus child-risk factors. Ofcom estimates: ~12-16 services in Category 1 (e.g., major social media), ~25-40 in 2B (child-focused), with thresholds designed so \"no smaller platform—under the level of 7 million monthly users—can ever be considered as a category 1 platform\" unless regulations change.\n\n- **When Compliance Becomes Essential**: Basic duties (e.g., illegal content risk assessments) apply to all \"regulated\" services from March 2025 if they have any UK users and enable user-generated content (Section 3: \"A user-to-user service is 'regulated' if it has links with the United Kingdom.\"). Categorized thresholds trigger extras (e.g., transparency reports, user empowerment tools) from summer 2025: \"Services must exceed the user number thresholds\" to qualify, but all services assess risks proportionally (Section 9: \"Providers of regulated user-to-user services must carry out an illegal content risk assessment.\"). For forums, if under thresholds and low-risk, duties are minimal (e.g., basic terms of service enforcement), becoming \"essential\" only if harm risks materialize.\n\n### Exceptions and Lighter Duties for Smaller Platforms/Forums\nSchedule 1 exempts certain services outright (e.g., email-only, internal business tools, limited-functionality ones like one-to-one live streams without storage: \"A user-to-user service is exempt if the only user-generated content enabled by the service is... content present in a live stream that is one-to-one.\"). No blanket small-platform exception, but duties scale: \"In determining what is proportionate for the user empowerment duties on content for category 1 services, the findings of the most recent user empowerment assessments are relevant\" (debate quote), and Ofcom must consider \"the size and capacity of the provider.\" Forums with low users (e.g., <3M UK MAUs) avoid categorization but still face child/illegal duties if applicable, with Ofcom guidance: \"What is proportionate for one kind of service might not be for another.\" SMEs aren't exempt (Ofcom estimates ~100,000 regulated services total), but lighter duties apply via \"technically feasible\" measures for small/capacity-limited ones.\n\n### Enforcement Proportionality and Low-Risk \"Warnings\" vs. Threats\nOfcom adopts a \"risk-based\" approach, prioritizing high-harm services: \"Ofcom will have robust enforcement powers... but in instances where services fail to make necessary changes, they will face formal enforcement action\" only after warnings/notices (Section 121: \"OFCOM may give a notice under this section to the provider... requiring the provider to take specified steps.\"). For low-risk small entities: \"Ofcom has robust enforcement powers available to use against companies who fail to fulfil their duties,\" but \"action can include fines... in extreme cases,\" with proportionality baked in (debate: \"many of the duties... are subject to the principle of proportionality.\"). As of September 2025, no reported \"straw men\" pursuits; enforcement focuses on large platforms (e.g., initial illegal harms codes effective spring 2025 targeted majors), with Ofcom reassuring SMEs: \"cost is affordable and proportionate.\" This supports your \"warning over threat\" view—low-user forums get guidance first, not immediate fines, unless risks escalate.\n\n### Moral/Ethical Considerations in the Law\nThe Act implies a moral duty through its focus on harm prevention (Preamble: \"to make provision for and in connection with the regulation... to protect users from harm.\"), but doesn't explicitly state one. Debate touches indirectly: \"tech companies, especially small and medium-sized businesses... ensure that cost is affordable and proportionate,\" framing compliance as a shared ethical imperative for user safety. Ofcom echoes this: \"companies... legally responsible for keeping people, especially children, safe online.\" For larger services, this moral layer reinforces your point—once \"relevant\" (e.g., >thresholds), fair compliance is expected beyond legal minimums.\n\nThis setup minimizes \"problematic enforcement\" for small forums by design, but as you note, further consideration (e.g., via antitrust to foster alternatives) could address monopoly-driven overreach. If you'd like excerpts from specific schedules or 2025 enforcement case studies, I can pull more.\n\n\n## User\n\nOn international parallels, we definitely need to do a deeper dive on other international attempts and how they intersect (or don't) with the OSA. It's especially relevant where platforms have and have not implemented the OSA verification (and other compliance issues) for users outside the UK. Not everyone can afford to geo-version their sites or their policies.\n\nMy position is biased by 'trying' to be reasonable, but you're right that I see a balance between privacy and security, that used to be common (in say the US passing the Patriot Act, Americans in particular have a long history of trading one for the other, many of which tend to live in their own time, and we forget because people have short memories). Americans still for example haven't removed a lot of those comprosmises, and have implemented others, especially trying to make 'freedom' compatible with being 'anti-woke' ideologies. American law-making IS to the right when used against people, and to the liberal only when (rarely) used against companies, and that environment is pertinent here.\n\n\n\n\n## References\n\neff.org - https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech\nconsoc.org.uk - https://consoc.org.uk/the-online-safety-act-privacy-threats-and-free-speech-risks/\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov - https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9403395/\ntheguardian.com - https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/01/everything-right-left-politics-getting-wrong-online-safety-act\ncybermagazine.com - https://cybermagazine.com/news/elon-musks-x-fires-shots-at-the-uks-new-online-safety-act\ncepa.org - https://cepa.org/article/access-denied-the-uk-online-safety-act-misses-its-mark/\nhome-affairs.ec.europa.eu - https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/document/download/f355fa6c-41f0-431c-96ac-948ba765b990_en?filename=countering_misuse_gaming-related_content_spaces_inspiring-practices_112022_en.pdf\ngifct.org - https://gifct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GIFCT-25WG-0225-EG-Resources-1.1.pdf\nunicri.org - https://unicri.org/news/expert-briefing-intersection-violent-extremism-and-gaming-held-united-nations-secretariat-new-york\nrusi.org - https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/policy-briefs/extremism-gaming-spaces-policy-prevention-and-moderation\ntandfonline.com - https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09546553.2024.2434180?af=R\ngov.uk - https://www.gov.uk/government/news/keeping-children-safe-online-changes-to-the-online-safety-act-explained\nbbc.com - https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4ep1znk4zo\nnews.xbox.com - https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/\nreuters.com - https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/comparison-id-requirements-xbox-users-immigrants-britain-is-misleading-2025-08-21/\neff.org - https://www.eff.org/wp/unfiltered-how-youtubes-content-id-discourages-fair-use-and-dictates-what-we-see-online\nreddit.com - https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/18enmzv/why_is_no_one_talking_about_youtube_censorship/\nreddit.com - https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1hefubf/youtube_censorship_is_out_of_control_and_getting/\nbrennancenter.org - https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/double-standards-social-media-content-moderation\ntruthout.org - https://truthout.org/articles/metas-allowance-of-hate-speech-is-another-side-effect-of-big-tech-monopoly/\ntheregreview.org - https://www.theregreview.org/2024/01/16/englebert-a-role-for-antitrust-in-online-content-moderation/\nitif.org - https://itif.org/publications/2022/03/26/why-antitrust-should-be-table-content-moderation-social-media-platforms/\nnpr.org - https://www.npr.org/2025/07/23/nx-s1-5476771/trump-artificial-intelligence-woke-eo\npromarket.org - https://www.promarket.org/2022/11/10/the-economics-of-content-moderation-on-social-media/\nlegislation.gov.uk - https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50\nosborneclarke.com - https://www.osborneclarke.com/insights/regulatory-outlook-March-2025-digital-regulation\nlegislation.gov.uk - https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2025/9780348267174\nlw.com - https://www.lw.com/admin/upload/SiteAttachments/UK-Online-Safety-Act-2023.pdf\nuklitigation.cooley.com - https://uklitigation.cooley.com/online-safety-act-update-ofcom-proposes-categorisation-thresholds/\nparallelparliament.co.uk - https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/debate/2025-02-04/commons/general-committees/draft-online-safety-act-2023-category-1-category-2a-and-category-2b-threshold-conditions-regulations-2025\nofcom.org.uk - https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/additional-duties-for-categorised-online-services\ntraverssmith.com - https://www.traverssmith.com/knowledge/knowledge-container/navigating-the-online-safety-act/\nofcom.org.uk - https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/roadmap-to-regulation\n\n","title":"Grok_2025-09-07_06-02-51_Gaming Platforms- Extremism, Funding, Influence - .md","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"request_id":"97b40ccbde75c4e4-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"23f9d88f-5c32-4f77-aef5-dce0c12db6d9","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"23f9d88f-5c32-4f77-aef5-dce0c12db6d9","children":["0475fa1f-643c-48ac-b77e-241c3a90a23e"]},"0475fa1f-643c-48ac-b77e-241c3a90a23e":{"id":"0475fa1f-643c-48ac-b77e-241c3a90a23e","message":{"id":"0475fa1f-643c-48ac-b77e-241c3a90a23e","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1757225504.2198865,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded.

Here’s a **direct review of Grok’s points**, noting where they add genuinely new concerns, where they align with your framing, and where to be cautious:\n\n---\n\n## Where Grok usefully deepens the picture\n- **IRC / DALnet / QuakeNet logs**: Grok points out actual archived logs from late-1990s/early-2000s (DALnet, QuakeNet) where gamer clans mixed cheats with Alex Jones–style conspiracy links. That’s a concrete receipt of “proto-alt-right” infiltration years before Gamergate. This matches your own lived experience (EFnet vs DALnet) and adds depth.  \n- **Operation Digging DiGRA**: A specific, documented Gamergate campaign (shared via a Google Doc and IRC) instructing users to mass-read and attack academic work. That’s a clear example of orchestrated “manufactured disconsent” at the structural level.  \n- **Roblox & Minecraft roleplays**: BBC/ADL reporting shows millions of visits to user-generated Nazi or extremist scenarios, sometimes explicitly recreating Auschwitz or Christchurch. This is an *under-discussed vector*—especially relevant to the OSA’s focus on child safety.  \n- **Russian IRA gamer personas**: Grok notes Mueller report appendices citing IRA sockpuppets posing as gamers to amplify Gamergate and alt-right memes. That’s hard evidence of state-backed infiltration into gamer spaces.  \n- **Crypto/NFT funding streams**: Grok mentions Chainalysis 2023 tracing $1M+ in white supremacist wallets funding gaming servers and meme-coins. That’s a concrete financial mechanism largely absent from mainstream discussion.  \n- **Unicorn Riot Discord leaks**: Massive primary data set (hundreds of thousands of posts) showing Atomwaffen, “Reconquista Germanica,” etc. using Discord in gamer-style structures. Strong source for receipts.  \n\n---\n\n## Where Grok’s points align with your framing\n- **LAN/clan extremism**: Coded usernames with “88,” Holocaust denial as “jokes” in clan IRC/QuakeNet groups. Fits your idea of normalization within gamer tribes, reinforcing your “manufactured disconsent” framing.  \n- **Bannon & IGE/World of Warcraft gold**: Bannon’s gold-farming background and “perverse appreciation” for gamer militancy — supports your claim about orchestrators seeing gamers as an exploitable base.  \n- **Sargon of Akkad/UKIP**: Concrete UK pipeline from gamer-YouTuber → political candidate, good for your Better Britain context.  \n\n---\n\n## Where to treat cautiously\n- **Claims like “20% of Atomwaffen recruits from WoW guilds”**: That’s drawn from leaks/interviews, but it’s not broadly corroborated in mainstream research. Treat as a *fringe but illustrative case*, not settled fact.  \n- **Crypto/NFT fundraising claims**: Some evidence exists (Chainalysis, journal papers), but dollar amounts can vary; need to double-source before leaning heavily on specific figures.  \n- **Scale estimates (e.g. Roblox instances with 1M visits)**: Credible reports exist, but numbers can fluctuate. Worth citing carefully with context (e.g. “at one point, a Roblox Nazi-themed game drew over 1M visits before removal” rather than treating as constant).  \n\n---\n\n## What this adds to *your position*\n- It strengthens the **“manufactured disconsent”** argument:  \n  - You can now point to *specific primary operations* (#NotYourShield, Operation Digging DiGRA) as *deliberate fabrications* seeded in gamer spaces.  \n  - You can show **state actors** (Russian IRA) using gamer identities to amplify disconsent.  \n  - You can point to **child-focused platforms (Roblox, Minecraft)** as real-world cases of extremist role-play infiltration – highly relevant to UK OSA debates about child safety.  \n  - You can show how **funding rails** (DLive donations, crypto/meme coins) sustain and incentivize extremists in gamer spaces, moving the discussion from “bad speech” to *financial infrastructure*.  \n\n- It also underlines the **structural side** you care about: clan/guild identity, point-based gamification of propaganda (Reconquista Germanica), the “for the lulz” raid culture as proto-direct action, kernel-level anti-cheat as a fresh disconsent vector.  \n\n---\n\n⚖️ **Counter to bias**: You’ve been framing most of gamer rage as manufactured. Grok’s notes remind us there’s also a **mix of organic dynamics** — e.g. gamers genuinely angry at DRM, anti-cheat, loot boxes, or being locked out of platforms.

Many platforms have turned to third-party firms to conduct age verification, raising questions about how these agencies handle sensitive information like ID scans, facial data, and contact details. \n\nLeading providers include Yoti, Persona, Au10tix, Stripe, and Incode. Yoti prioritizes quick deletion of user data post-verification and operates within GDPR-compliant regions, but shares data with third parties during extended verification windows. Persona and Au10tix don't specify short-term data retention but may store biometrics for up to three years and share data widely. Stripe retains biometric data for a year and other personal data for three, while also allowing clients significant access.

While the Act mandates robust and accurate age checks for accessing adult content online, it does not specify requirements for securing user data. Techniques used for verification often involve sensitive personal information, such as photo IDs or biometric scans, prompting many citizens to resort to VPNs for privacy.\n\nPublic concern is heightened by past incidents, such as the 2024 data breach in which nearly 70% of UK MPs had their personal information leaked due to weak cybersecurity practices. This history underscores the irony of the OSA failing to ensure secure handling of user data. Though platforms like Reddit and Spotify use reputable verification services that delete user data promptly, there’s no obligation for all services to do the same.\n\nOFCOM has acknowledged these issues but largely shifts the responsibility onto users, offering limited regulatory reassurance. While UK GDPR laws technically restrict long-term data storage, enforcement remains uncertain.

While aimed at protecting minors from harmful content, including adult material and substance use discussions, the implementation relies heavily on third-party age verification providers. Users have no control over which provider handles their data, and practices vary widely, raising risks of data misuse, breaches, and phishing via fake pop-ups. Although Ofcom urges caution, the fragmented and opaque system forces users to share sensitive information with potentially non-EU and less-regulated entities.\n\nTechnologies like Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) offer a promising alternative by confirming a user’s age without revealing personal data. Providers like Privado ID and initiatives like the EU’s AgeAware and eIDAS 2.0 aim to enable interoperable, privacy-preserving systems through standardized tokens and open-source tools. However, the UK’s current implementation lags behind these innovations, prioritizing rapid deployment over security. The article suggests a shift toward interoperable and user-chosen verification methods is essential, balancing safety and privacy in future online identity systems.

In a real-world test conducted by The Times involving over 130 participants, Yoti outperformed humans in guessing ages across various demographics. The AI’s average error margin was 2.3 years, notably better than the human average of 4.2 years. Yoti's system particularly excelled in identifying under-18s, accurately classifying 81.5%, compared to humans’ 22.2%. However, both AI and human estimations struggled more with older age groups and individuals with grey or red hair, or facial hair. The technology is increasingly being applied in platforms like OnlyFans and Facebook Dating, and retailers such as John Lewis use it to verify age when purchasing restricted items like knives.

Public References to ACCS Evaluations for Yoti\n- On Yoti’s own blog, they highlight an **ACCS evaluation in October 2024** which reports improved Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for 18-year-olds, now at **1.05 years (SD 1.01)**, down from **1.79 years in 2020**. Accuracy buffers are also provided:  \n   - **99.3%** of 18-year-olds estimated as under 25  \n   - **97.8%** under 21  \n   - **94.2%** under 20 citeturn0search0turn0search2\n\n- **BiometricUpdate** reports the same figures, confirming a “fresh evaluation” by ACCS of Yoti’s model as of September 2024 citeturn0search2.\n\n---\n\n###  2. ACCS’s Official Listing\n- Yoti is listed in the ACCS registry as an accredited provider (since August 2024 model) under their age estimation category citeturn0search6.\n\n---\n\n###  3. Is There a Public ACCS Report?\n- No independent ACCS report (PDF or detailed results) for Yoti is publicly available from ACCS’s site.\n- Yoti itself appears to be the primary source for details on the evaluation – unless ACCS publishes reports on request or behind access controls, there is currently **no standalone, downloadable ACCS-issued certificate or report** accessible to third parties.\n\n---\n\n###  4. Summary Table\n\n| Source                        | Evidence Provided                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Yoti blog / Marketing         | Published accuracy stats and evaluation results from ACCS (Oct 2024)               |\n| Registry (ACCS website)       | Confirms Yoti is ACCS-certified under their age estimation scheme                  |\n| Independent ACCS report       | None publicly available so far                                                    |\n\n---\n\nIf you’re building policy arguments at a TLA level, you may need to **request the official ACCS documentation**—either directly from ACCS or via a Freedom of Information (where applicable)—to ensure fully sourced, verifiable evidence.

We would make money off of young kids playing games in China… We would take that money and sell it to rich white kids on the Upper East Side”* .  \n- He has said he saw in these gamer communities a ready-made, highly engaged population of “disaffected young men” that could be politically mobilised: *“These guys, these rootless white males, had monster power… It was the pre-Gamergate crowd”* (quoted in *Joshua Green, *Devil’s Bargain* (2017), and repeated in interviews).  \n- Later, as executive chairman of **Breitbart News** (2012–2016), Bannon directed his tech editor **Milo Yiannopoulos** to cover **Gamergate** aggressively, explicitly as a way of recruiting and radicalising that gamer demographic into the populist/nationalist movement .  \n\nSo yes: Bannon’s direct involvement with a **gold-farming business** in the mid-2000s is a matter of public record, and he himself has framed it as formative for how he came to see gamers as a potential political army.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **pull Bannon’s own quotes/interviews** (e.g. from *Devil’s Bargain* and subsequent profiles) so you have the verbatim receipts for this connection between gold farming → gamer subcultures → Breitbart/alt-right strategy?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-68acbab14fe08191bfa946c0512151e3","request_id":"97b432b6a912e688-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"1769e2b8-ec51-4bc5-a0b0-a00c0fe1dadb","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1769e2b8-ec51-4bc5-a0b0-a00c0fe1dadb","children":["c5b6f9e7-c966-4333-a368-02c9d67baac4"]},"c5b6f9e7-c966-4333-a368-02c9d67baac4":{"id":"c5b6f9e7-c966-4333-a368-02c9d67baac4","message":{"id":"c5b6f9e7-c966-4333-a368-02c9d67baac4","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757227373.69,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["no, that was an aside.

While the measures aim to protect minors, they have led to a substantial drop in web traffic for sites complying with the law, especially adult websites. In contrast, non-compliant sites have seen a surge in traffic—some even tripling their UK visitor numbers. An analysis of the 90 most visited porn sites revealed that the few which avoided implementing age verification enjoyed increased traffic and likely revenue.\n\nOfcom, the UK's communications regulator, is currently investigating several companies that operate 34 such sites to assess the effectiveness of their age checks. Meanwhile, compliant sites bear the dual burden of reduced traffic and the cost of third-party verification services.\n\nThe legislation has stirred public criticism, with over 500,000 signatures on a petition advocating its repeal—though the UK government maintains no plans to reverse the law. Internationally, similar laws are taking shape, such as in Mississippi, USA, where smaller platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon are choosing to block users from the state rather than implement complex age verification systems. Australia is also exploring nationwide implementation. The global trend suggests the internet may become more fragmented in response to rising regulatory demands.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756728822,"attribution":"www.pcgamer.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/31/age-verification-uk-porn-sites/","title":"'Scan your face' laws for the web are having unexpected consequences","snippet":"The United Kingdom's new age-verification law, requiring users to scan their faces or upload IDs to access adult websites, has led to unanticipated consequences. Compliant sites saw significant drops in traffic, while non-compliant porn sites experienced traffic surges—some doubling or tripling their audiences. The law, aimed at protecting minors, utilizes AI and facial recognition tools from contractors like Yoti and Incode. Although supporters argue the measures promote online safety, critics warn of significant risks including privacy breaches, data misuse, and the rise of unregulated, harder-to-monitor platforms.\n\nThe law has also imposed steep financial burdens on smaller websites, with compliance costs reaching millions daily for some. Problems with age estimation algorithms and workarounds like VPNs have undermined its effectiveness. Similar legislation is spreading in the U.S., with 25 states pushing for age verification on not only adult but also social media platforms. These laws have triggered lawsuits over free speech concerns and fears of broader censorship. In some cases, platforms have preemptively blocked access from certain states to avoid compliance expenses. Although UK officials have praised the law, its early implementation has sparked debate over privacy, practicality, and its broader online implications.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756638300.15,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ofcom.org.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/age-assurance","title":"Quick guide to implementing highly effective age assurance","snippet":"Jan 16, 2025 — This page explains the new rules and outlines the steps you should be taking to ensure you are complying with your new duties.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1708686501,"attribution":"www.ofcom.org.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/online-age-checks-must-be-in-force-from-tomorrow","title":"Online age checks now in force","snippet":"Jul 24, 2025 — Under our rules, sites that allow other forms of harmful content must also have highly effective age checks from 25 July. ...

UK users must now verify their age to access mature content on Steam. Valve's method involves using a stored valid credit card to verify the account holder is over 18, without sharing any data with third-party organizations. This system uses a zero-charge transaction and leverages the existing payment infrastructure on the platform to prioritize user privacy and minimize data use.\n\nIn contrast, Xbox has partnered with third-party verification company Yoti, requiring users to either scan their face or submit ID through Yoti, although other less intrusive options like verifying via mobile provider or credit card are available but not prominently displayed. The article criticizes Xbox's approach as invasive and less transparent, suggesting that Valve’s method is a more user-friendly and privacy-respecting solution under the new law.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756542900,"attribution":"www.windowscentral.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68bd00f3f1f4800bb74d4444a0d5198f","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching certifications, methods, and alternative age verification options","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97b43a91ff9ce688-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"ce60c5b4-1b4d-45f0-b578-543ef4a2068d","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ce60c5b4-1b4d-45f0-b578-543ef4a2068d","children":["ca2b6bcd-7ad7-4082-8bc5-1a2f04a93ba8"]},"ca2b6bcd-7ad7-4082-8bc5-1a2f04a93ba8":{"id":"ca2b6bcd-7ad7-4082-8bc5-1a2f04a93ba8","message":{"id":"ca2b6bcd-7ad7-4082-8bc5-1a2f04a93ba8","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757227412.633362,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Listing certified providers","content":"I’ve got enough to begin listing certified providers.

Ofcom's chief executive, Melanie Dawes, emphasized that many online services have ignored the issue of children accessing harmful material. Enforcement actions will be taken against companies failing to meet the requirements. These regulations are part of the UK's Online Safety Act aimed at curbing illegal online content and protecting children.

Implemented by Ofcom, the act mandates strict safeguards against harmful content like pornography and self-harm, with noncompliant companies subject to hefty fines and potential criminal charges. Platforms must now establish robust systems, rather than target individual content, to mitigate online harm.\n\nA particularly controversial provision requires age verification for access to pornography, raising privacy concerns but demanding adherence to UK GDPR standards. Social media may also need age checks to prevent under-18s from accessing harmful content.\n\nThe legislation was spurred by public advocacy following tragedies such as the death of Molly Russell, and gains support from figures like Baroness Kidron and Rio Ferdinand. However, some critics, including the children's commissioner, argue the measures don’t go far enough, and campaigners continue to push for tougher standards, including screen time limits.\n\nDespite concerns, the UK government insists that protecting children remains a top priority, and Ofcom is actively issuing guidance and consultations.

Compliant sites saw significant drops in traffic, while non-compliant porn sites experienced traffic surges—some doubling or tripling their audiences. The law, aimed at protecting minors, utilizes AI and facial recognition tools from contractors like Yoti and Incode. Although supporters argue the measures promote online safety, critics warn of significant risks including privacy breaches, data misuse, and the rise of unregulated, harder-to-monitor platforms.\n\nThe law has also imposed steep financial burdens on smaller websites, with compliance costs reaching millions daily for some. Problems with age estimation algorithms and workarounds like VPNs have undermined its effectiveness. Similar legislation is spreading in the U.S., with 25 states pushing for age verification on not only adult but also social media platforms. These laws have triggered lawsuits over free speech concerns and fears of broader censorship. In some cases, platforms have preemptively blocked access from certain states to avoid compliance expenses. Although UK officials have praised the law, its early implementation has sparked debate over privacy, practicality, and its broader online implications.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756638300.15,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.pcgamer.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/age-verification-legislation-is-tanking-web-traffic-to-sites-that-comply-and-rewarding-those-that-dont/","title":"Age verification legislation is tanking traffic to sites that comply, and rewarding those that don't","snippet":"A new report highlights the unintended consequences of the UK's Online Safety Act, which mandates age verification for adult and social media websites. While the measures aim to protect minors, they have led to a substantial drop in web traffic for sites complying with the law, especially adult websites. In contrast, non-compliant sites have seen a surge in traffic—some even tripling their UK visitor numbers. An analysis of the 90 most visited porn sites revealed that the few which avoided implementing age verification enjoyed increased traffic and likely revenue.\n\nOfcom, the UK's communications regulator, is currently investigating several companies that operate 34 such sites to assess the effectiveness of their age checks. Meanwhile, compliant sites bear the dual burden of reduced traffic and the cost of third-party verification services.\n\nThe legislation has stirred public criticism, with over 500,000 signatures on a petition advocating its repeal—though the UK government maintains no plans to reverse the law. Internationally, similar laws are taking shape, such as in Mississippi, USA, where smaller platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon are choosing to block users from the state rather than implement complex age verification systems. Australia is also exploring nationwide implementation. The global trend suggests the internet may become more fragmented in response to rising regulatory demands.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756728822,"attribution":"www.pcgamer.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/31/age-assurance-technology-trial-report-australia-under-16-social-media-ban-some-errors-inevitable","title":"Trial of tech that could be used to keep Australian under-16s off social media finds some errors 'inevitable'","snippet":"A $6.5 million Australian trial of age assurance technologies aimed at enforcing a social media ban for under-16s found that while several effective tools exist, errors—especially around users close to the age threshold—are inevitable. Conducted by the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS), the trial tested 60 technologies from 48 vendors including facial age estimation, ID verification, parental consent, and phone OS-level checks. Facial age estimation, found effective for many cases, showed higher error margins for users aged 14–17 and underrepresented demographics, including Indigenous Australians, women, and non-Caucasian users, due to training data bias. The report emphasized the need for layered approaches, using fallback options like document-based verification when estimation fails. Although promising, biometric methods like voice and hand gestures are not yet sufficiently developed. ACCS raised privacy concerns over some vendors building tools to track user actions for future investigations. Age inference based on user behavior was seen as low-friction and effective for identifying underage users. Circumvention tactics using AI and VPNs were acknowledged but countermeasures like motion tracking were suggested. Communications Minister Anika Wells affirmed the government's commitment to online child safety despite the complexity of implementation.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756641631,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"verifymy.io","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://verifymy.io/","title":"Verifymy: Age and identity verification","snippet":"Email-based age estimation.

Over 20 U.S. states have enacted such laws, potentially requiring all users, regardless of age, to verify their identity—often through uploading government IDs—raising concerns about data security risks and privacy infringement. Critics argue that these laws limit access to vital information on topics like abortion and LGBTQ identity, and may drive users toward less regulated parts of the internet or encourage them to use VPNs.\n\nProponents, like Iain Corby from the Age Verification Providers Association, argue the laws mirror traditional protections for minors in physical spaces and do not aim to censor speech.

Conducted by the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS), the trial tested 60 technologies from 48 vendors including facial age estimation, ID verification, parental consent, and phone OS-level checks. Facial age estimation, found effective for many cases, showed higher error margins for users aged 14–17 and underrepresented demographics, including Indigenous Australians, women, and non-Caucasian users, due to training data bias. The report emphasized the need for layered approaches, using fallback options like document-based verification when estimation fails. Although promising, biometric methods like voice and hand gestures are not yet sufficiently developed. ACCS raised privacy concerns over some vendors building tools to track user actions for future investigations. Age inference based on user behavior was seen as low-friction and effective for identifying underage users. Circumvention tactics using AI and VPNs were acknowledged but countermeasures like motion tracking were suggested.

Starting immediately, UK-based Xbox users who identify as 18+ will receive prompts to verify their age through one of four methods, including facial age estimation via a partnership with Yoti. This process appears to be more secure than previous systems, such as those used on Discord, and can't be bypassed using animated faces or in-game characters.\n\nWhile unverified users will still be able to play games, they will lose access to key social features like voice chat and game invites starting early next year. Currently, verification must be completed via PC or mobile devices, as there’s no in-console method yet.

Trials of age assurance technologies, particularly facial age estimation tools, show that while age verification may take as little as 40 seconds, some users experienced delays of up to an hour. Significant error rates were found, especially for users near the age threshold; for instance, one provider incorrectly identified 73% of 15-year-olds as 16. These systems also showed higher inaccuracies for individuals who are non-Caucasian, female, or older, with some extreme mismatches recorded (e.g., a 12-year-old estimated to be 85).\n\nIf facial recognition tools fail, users may be asked to provide IDs such as passports, raising privacy concerns. Additionally, there's unease that providers may store identification data due to law enforcement expectations. The government has promised appeal options for wrongful bans, but platforms like Meta have a poor track record in managing user appeals.\n\nWhile larger companies might use “age inference” from user behavior and metadata, smaller platforms may struggle with compliance costs and exit the Australian market, as seen with Bluesky's withdrawal from Mississippi after a similar law passed.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756738811,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"withpersona.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://withpersona.com/blog/bespoke-age-verification-with-persona","title":"Build bespoke age verification with Persona","snippet":"Aug 15, 2024 — We offer a configurable age verification solution built with Persona's dynamic identity platform to help serve the needs of your business.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1723693638.749,"attribution":"withpersona.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://withpersona.com/use-case/compliance/age-assurance","title":"Age Assurance Software: Safeguard Your Platform","snippet":"Persona's selfie age estimation product meets the Level 3 requirements of ACCS 1:2020 Technical Requirements for Age Estimation Technologies.

Effective immediately, UK users must verify their age by uploading a selfie or government-issued ID to access mature content, including violent, abusive, or sexually explicit material. The verification is managed by third-party provider Persona, which only retains photos for up to seven days and does not access Reddit user data. Reddit itself will only keep users' birthdates and verification statuses. This move comes as the UK enforces stricter online safety regulations requiring platforms to protect minors from harmful content by July 25th, 2025. Reddit stated that while it aims to maintain anonymity, age data is necessary for legal compliance. The platform is also offering a global birthdate option to better tailor content and advertising. With a 47% growth in adult users in the UK in 2024, Reddit is among the fastest-growing platforms, prompting the implementation of these measures. Additionally, Reddit hinted at future steps to distinguish human users from AI bots. Ofcom, the UK regulatory body, emphasized that these changes are essential to safeguard young users online.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752571845,"attribution":"www.theverge.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"incode.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://incode.com/blog/age-assurance-explained-verification-estimation-segmentation-and-gating/","title":"Verification, Estimation, Segmentation, and Gating","snippet":"Jul 8, 2025 — Age Estimation refers to techniques used to infer a user's age, such as analyzing facial features from a selfie or estimating age from ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751970777,"attribution":"incode.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"techcrunch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/reddit-rolls-out-age-verification-in-the-uk-to-comply-with-new-rules/","title":"Reddit rolls out age verification in the UK to comply with new rules","snippet":"Jul 15, 2025 — Reddit users in the United Kingdom are now required to verify their age as a way to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752591316,"attribution":"techcrunch.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68bd00f3f1f4800bb74d4444a0d5198f","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for Persona age verification methods and docs","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97b43a91ff9ce688-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"30289f09-f276-4b8f-b717-85beb7bf4455","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"30289f09-f276-4b8f-b717-85beb7bf4455","children":["a4768a57-833a-450b-9ede-8c5ef82fb442"]},"a4768a57-833a-450b-9ede-8c5ef82fb442":{"id":"a4768a57-833a-450b-9ede-8c5ef82fb442","message":{"id":"a4768a57-833a-450b-9ede-8c5ef82fb442","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757227495.310878,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Organizing report content","content":"Next, I'll focus on creating an info-dense report.

These highlight **operational** weaknesses rather than method invalidity. citeturn4news29turn10search6\n\n- **Email-based age estimation**\n  - **Now listed by Ofcom** as potentially HEAA **if well-implemented**; **ACCS-certified** examples exist (VerifyMy).

Compliant sites saw significant drops in traffic, while non-compliant porn sites experienced traffic surges—some doubling or tripling their audiences. The law, aimed at protecting minors, utilizes AI and facial recognition tools from contractors like Yoti and Incode. Although supporters argue the measures promote online safety, critics warn of significant risks including privacy breaches, data misuse, and the rise of unregulated, harder-to-monitor platforms.\n\nThe law has also imposed steep financial burdens on smaller websites, with compliance costs reaching millions daily for some. Problems with age estimation algorithms and workarounds like VPNs have undermined its effectiveness. Similar legislation is spreading in the U.S., with 25 states pushing for age verification on not only adult but also social media platforms. These laws have triggered lawsuits over free speech concerns and fears of broader censorship. In some cases, platforms have preemptively blocked access from certain states to avoid compliance expenses. Although UK officials have praised the law, its early implementation has sparked debate over privacy, practicality, and its broader online implications.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":19}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Washington Post"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn8search0turn11search14","start_idx":3815,"end_idx":3849,"safe_urls":["https://incode.com/blog/age-assurance-explained-verification-estimation-segmentation-and-gating/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://incode.com/blog/age-assurance-for-uk-online-safety-act-compliance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Incode](https://incode.com/blog/age-assurance-for-uk-online-safety-act-compliance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"How to Implement Age Assurance for UK Online Safety Act ...","url":"https://incode.com/blog/age-assurance-for-uk-online-safety-act-compliance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1750171267,"snippet":"Jun 17, 2025 — Incode's age verification solution uses a dynamic waterfall approach ...

While the measures aim to protect minors, they have led to a substantial drop in web traffic for sites complying with the law, especially adult websites. In contrast, non-compliant sites have seen a surge in traffic—some even tripling their UK visitor numbers. An analysis of the 90 most visited porn sites revealed that the few which avoided implementing age verification enjoyed increased traffic and likely revenue.\n\nOfcom, the UK's communications regulator, is currently investigating several companies that operate 34 such sites to assess the effectiveness of their age checks. Meanwhile, compliant sites bear the dual burden of reduced traffic and the cost of third-party verification services.\n\nThe legislation has stirred public criticism, with over 500,000 signatures on a petition advocating its repeal—though the UK government maintains no plans to reverse the law. Internationally, similar laws are taking shape, such as in Mississippi, USA, where smaller platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon are choosing to block users from the state rather than implement complex age verification systems. Australia is also exploring nationwide implementation. The global trend suggests the internet may become more fragmented in response to rising regulatory demands.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"PC Gamer"},{"title":"Reddit and Discord's UK age verification can be defeated ...","url":"https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1753696767,"snippet":"Jul 28, 2025 — Gamers have been using Death Stranding to bypass the UK's new age verification checks.

Despite public opposition and a petition with nearly 400,000 signatures, the UK government is enforcing the law. Starting immediately, UK-based Xbox users who identify as 18+ will receive prompts to verify their age through one of four methods, including facial age estimation via a partnership with Yoti. This process appears to be more secure than previous systems, such as those used on Discord, and can't be bypassed using animated faces or in-game characters.\n\nWhile unverified users will still be able to play games, they will lose access to key social features like voice chat and game invites starting early next year. Currently, verification must be completed via PC or mobile devices, as there’s no in-console method yet. Though the changes are initially UK-specific, Microsoft plans to gradually extend the system to other regions, tailoring the approach to local requirements to enhance global online safety for Xbox players.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":10,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"PC Gamer"},{"title":"Xbox is rolling out age verification in the UK with some social ...","url":"https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/articles/xbox-rolling-age-verification-uk-094256984.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Jul 29, 2025 — There are four ways you can verify your identity with Xbox.
