You can find reasoning for its changes at the end. I thought it might make an interesting contrast.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog. It’s generally gone well, but I want to raise some points…\n\nRewording Issues\nIt’s extremely aggressive when it comes to rewording. I often have to say “use my words” or “stick to my phrasing” three or four times before it stops turning whatever I said into mulch. In GPT-5’s latest 'quick’ mode (basically GPT-3) it’s extremely lazy, so statements like “really THINK about it” or just waiting for lower load times, when it’s more likely to use 'thinking’ mode, seem to help.\n\nGiving it my original text with each repeated imperative, or explaining why I said something in a particular way, can help. But there are things it just doesn’t like: run-on sentences (even those I use for rhythm, humour, or stress) often get chopped into nonsense, and intentional misuse of grammar… well, it really hates that.\n\nConnective Tissue\nIt does a decent job of 'connective tissue.’ If I write a skeet rant as a draft and copy it in, then after I’m done forcing it not to change my phrasing, it can turn it into a post with some flow. But I tend to think between the lines, and my earlier posts read more like 5–7 standalone paragraphs than one coherent piece.\n\nIt’s not as 'fun’ as writing alone, but sometimes useful. Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\n\nTone and Audience\nIt has a decent sense of tone. If I say “fucking terrible policy,” it usually knows I’m exaggerating for effect, but will almost always suggest toning it down. I don’t mind alienating readers: good-faith readers can work with their own emotions, and I’m not interested in writing for bad-faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\n\nEarlier posts on this blog show more empty, corpo-feeling language — back when I hadn’t yet learned how to force it to keep my words, but without the unintentional digs at readers that actually do make people switch off.\n\nResearch Value\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode), it’s invaluable — almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is too steep). You have to tell it to cite sources, specify what sources are acceptable (I avoid newspapers except as support), and enforce rules like “multiple claims can’t rely on one source.” The best sources are researchers, government agencies, universities, and primary datasets — not opinion pieces.\n\nChatGPT and Grok vary a lot. I prefer ChatGPT’s final output, but Grok is excellent for critique. I’ll often ask it for a second opinion with phrases like “tear the arsehole out of this blog post” or “severely criticise this claim, with evidence.”\n\nRed Flags\nA lot of people I’ve talked to (or watched using it) are aware of its limitations, but there are problems:\n\nPeople give their preferred LLM too much agency, lifting responses wholesale without really reading them.\nThey talk about the model as if it “understood” or “felt” things.\nThe press leaves a fog of “stupid” opinions about AI out in the wild, misrepresenting what it does and when to use it.\nNeurodivergence and Flow\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD). When I used to write directly into my dash, I’d often lose the plot halfway: either brain fog or rabbit-holing into tangents. I still do this, but the AI helps me check: “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? Are all the sections connected?” Sometimes it helps me split a messy article into two clearer ones.\n\nSpeed and Structure\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about quality. But it’s too eager to push you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response discourages sitting with a piece. My earlier posts are more like quick takes; now I prefer slower, deeper posts with sources.\n\nPraise and Phrasing\nChatGPT in particular loves to praise you. Even with project voice settings, it’s unavoidable. I once tried to cut the first and last paragraph of every response with a userscript, but the HTML made it unreliable. My workaround: ignore the fluff. The prompt should come from me, and the judgment of success should too. The more you let it take control, the further you drift from meaningful content.\n\nSwearing actually helps. If I swear at it, it follows instructions more closely and does more work. For one project, some of my logs (usually at high-load times) include things like: “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction], like I said, you dick…” It’s partly venting, partly effective. (And no, I would never speak to an actual colleague like that.)\n\nCommunity Use\nIn neurodivergent spaces, I see a lot of people using ChatGPT, sometimes well, sometimes poorly. It’s easy to spot when someone didn’t work their input enough. If you use a free/cheap model, don’t expect much. Even under Plus, GPT-3 and Claude have been lazy since Agent mode got mainstream. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs — not by criticising them for using the tool, but by showing what it does well and what it doesn’t.\n\nReactions to AI Writing\nSome people will dismiss any content they think is AI-written, even when it isn’t. On Reddit, I’ve seen the default retort: “AI slop, garbage opinion.” That’s just lazy. I wrote earlier about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people are writing like AI now — easy-reading rhythm, low-bar accessibility, short paragraphs.\n\nMy Current Use\nSo far, I’m happy using it for:\n\nTesting the strength of a claim\nSuggesting simpler phrasing for complex issues\nBut I’d avoid prompts like “Rewrite this in the style of X,” because it almost never delivers what I want.\n\nFinal Thought\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (I’ve already seen it pushed in corporates I know). But as a workflow tool — used carefully, only for what it’s good at — it’ll stay in my toolbox for now.\n\nEdits the AI made (in ChatGPT’s own words)\nHere’s the reasoning behind the minimal changes I made, stripped of the structural stuff (headings, spacing, etc.):\n\nClarified dense sentences: a few run-ons were split just enough to preserve rhythm without losing meaning (e.g. “mulch” instead of “much,” trimming the overstacked commas).\nRemoved duplicates/repetition: you circled back to some points (like praise-padding, rewording aggression, connective tissue) multiple times; I left them once, where they landed strongest.\nLight wording polish: fixed a couple of small slips that looked accidental rather than intentional (“mulch” vs “much,” “arshole” → “arsehole”), but left deliberate quirks intact.\nContext clues: added a single explanatory aside where an acronym (AuDHD) might throw readers unfamiliar with it.\nTone preservation: all the swearing, snark, and exaggeration stayed — I only smoothed where it risked confusing the point rather than sharpening it.\nThe AI version isn’t “nicer,” it’s just trimmed of redundancies and cleaned of unintentional noise, while leaving your intended noise (humour, rhythm, tangents) intact.\n\nMy 'take’\nThese changes are generally reasonable, except where it dropped a couple of entire points (probably to satisfy its word limiter), you may prefer one or the other, but I try to land somewhere in the middle. I don’t like how LLMs take off ALL the sharp edges, but that is definitely a utility I find useful sometimes.\n\nI’ve recently been using it to write in-depth research reports and important feedback and complaints (like to my GP, mentioned in an earlier blog post). Used as a tool, not a lifestyle, I’m comfortable endorsing AI more broadly, and hope with my upcoming project to highlight some of this value, especially in complex comms, to others in future.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai, #communication\nPosted 21 hours ago with 1 note\nOn a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’\nThis is the entirely handwritten version of this post, you can read: On a few months of writing with an AI 'assistant’ (AI tweaked version) here.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog, there’s an old post about it down there somewhere.

I often have to say “use my words” or “stick to my phrasing” three or four times, before it stops turning whatever I said into a mulch. In GPT-5’s latest 'quick’ mode (basically GPT-3) it’s extremely lazy, so currently statements like “really THINK about it” or just trying to avoid peak load times, when it’s more likely to use 'thinking’ mode helps.\nGiving it my original text with each repeated imperative, or explaining why I said something in a particular way can help, but there’s some stuff it just doesn’t like, run-on sentences (even those I use for rhythm, humour, or stress) often get split into two sentences that barely make sense, and intentional misuse of grammar, well… it, really hates, that, absolutely!!!!\nIt does a pretty good job of 'connective tissue’, like if I write a skeet rant as a draft, then copy that in; after I’m done telling it not to change my phrasing or words, it can turn it into a post that has _some_ sense of flow, but I tend to think between the lines, and you can just scroll down and see how earlier posts read more like 5-7 independent paragraphs than a coherent piece.\nIt’s not as 'fun’ as writing alone, but it does occasionally have useful suggestions. Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft… [draft]” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\nIt’s got a reasonable sense of tone, like it knows that if I say “fucking terrible policy” that I’m exaggerating to make a point, but does almost always suggest toning it down to avoid alienating readers. I don’t mind alienating readers, because a good faith reader can use their own emotions to continue digesting a piece, and I’m not interested in writing for bad faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\nIf you scroll down to the earlier posts on this 'blog’, you can see the emptier/corpo language, because I hadn’t learned how to make it say what I said, but without the problematic emotional states that actually do cause readers to check out (like unintentionally criticising the reader themselves).\nThe word-soup feeling diminishes as I added more of my existing articles and more content written directly by me to the project, and as I added more chats, especially because ChatGPT projects now correctly contextualise text files and chats on a project, including instructions.\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode) it’s really invaluable, almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is just a little too steep). You absolutely have to tell it to cite sources, which sources are acceptable (I generally advise no newspaper stories except as support), and how multiple claims shouldn’t rely on a single source, and how authoritative sources come from researchers, government agencies, universities and other primary datasets, not from opinion pieces (except where the research is looking for opinions).\nChatGPT and Grok vary wildly on specific subjects, and I tend to prefer the final output from ChatGPT, but Grok is very good at criticising content, so I’ll often ask it for a 'second opinion’, including phrases like 'tear the arsehole out of this blog post’ or 'severely criticise this claim, citing reasons with evidence’.\nI’ve talked with quite a few people (and seen some using it directly) about how they use these tools, and generally people (at least the people I know) are aware of the limitations and opportunities of these tools, but there are some red flags… a) People give their preferred LLM far too much agency, not only in how they parse and use responses (often just lifting content and barely even reading it before shipping it) but in how they express how the engine understood or felt about the issue. and b) The way the press cover it leaves a lot of 'stupid’ opinions about how AI works out in the wild… often massively misrepresenting what it can do and when to use it.\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD) so when I used to write in my own dash directly, I’d get half-way into an article and lose the plot completely… either through brain-fog, or just through rabbit-holing into a tangent (probably my most difficult-to-overcome behaviour). I still do this in the posts I’m writing myself, but it does come in handy when I’m done writing to ask something like “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? are all the sections connected?” and it’s occasionally helped me take a single piece that gets lost in the middle, and turn that into 2 pieces that each have a little less to say, but better capture and communicate the subject.\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about the quality of results, but it’s really eager to get you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response really discourages chewing over a piece, and my earlier posts demonstrate that. They’re basically just 'takes’, and while I don’t mind posting a take here or there, I prefer the depth of the longer form posts with various supporting citations.\nI also wrote about how ChatGPT in particular loves to celebrate you, give you a pat on the back for being such a smart boy… I’ve tried to mitigate that by setting my project voice, but it’s basically unavoidable. I even tried writing a userscript that cuts off the first and last paragraph of every response, but finding the right HTML elements proved impossible to do reliably. Just don’t read the first and last paragraph of any response from any model, use your old-school banner-blindness. The prompt should always be coming from you, and what you thought about how well it did what you asked for. Every time you let it take control, you can only get further away from valuable/meaningful content.\nSwearing actually fucking helps. When you swear at the engine, it takes your instructions more seriously, makes it slightly less lazy, and aside from the word “THINK” under GPT-5, is one of the few ways to get it to do more real work, and more closely follow what you told it to do. For my main current project, some of my chat logs (mostly from high-load times like Saturday morning) say things like “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction] , like I said, you dick… [claim]”, partly cos it feels good to vent, and it’s a computer so who cares (I would not speak to a human like this, and never ever have. I worked with a guy who did early in my career and he indirectly taught me that’s a terrible way to work, even for a hardcore utilitarian), but also because it really does do a better job in the response.\nThere’s mixed positions on please and thank you. The platforms would rather you didn’t (it does cost them for every response, they’d prefer you to be utilitarian), but realistically the cost is minimal, and when it’s delivering well, it makes _me_ feel better to treat it like a co-writer I respect, so I tend to communicate with it in much the same way I did when I hired freelancers (basically it ate their job, as I no longer have a virtual assistant to pickup my more mundane tasks).\nI’ve noticed a lot of other people in generally 'neurodivergent’ (man, I hate that term, for its 'othering’) spaces using ChatGPT especially, some more than others, and while many are getting real value from being able to construct and analyse complex thoughts with relatively low effort; it’s easy to see when some people didn’t really work their input enough. If you use a cheap/free model, do NOT expect good results. Even under Plus, GPT3 and Claude have been particularly stupid/lazy since the rise of Agent mode on mainstream platforms. It’s no wonder OpenAI decided to just mash their models together under a marshall and call it GPT-5. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs when you see it, not by criticising them for using the tool but by helping them understand what it does well and what it doesn’t.\nMy last major point, is some people will be triggered by any form of AI writing, even if it’s not writing output by an AI. I noticed this especially on reddit, a common retort, even for non-AI based content is something like “low quality AI slop is just a garbage opinion”, but I think that’s just a lazy go-to, as I think one of my earlier posts was about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people started writing like AI for real, because aside from the hypnotic rhythm of its paragraphs, it generally writes text that is easy to digest, especially if you set a lower reading ease.\nOn progress so far, I’m pretty happy with my general use of it in use cases like “Test the strength of this claim” or “Suggest some ways to express this complex issue in plain English”, but I’d probably avoid in future just saying “Rewrite this in the style of these”, because it rarely just gives you what you actually want.\n\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (as I’ve already seen it being pushed on corpos I know), but as a general quality and workflow tool, used only for what it’s good at, it’ll stay in my toolbox for a while.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai\nPosted 23 hours ago\nJournalists making rage, not change\nThis barely researched news story landed on the r/manchester reddit from the guardian yesterday: English councils pay private landlords millions in incentives to house homeless families\n\nimage\nStories like this with no sense of scale always leave me wondering what they _really_ mean, beyond being clickbait, so I looked into it…\n\nFor scope… I’m primarily interested in Manchester (I live here, and they have many more occurences than any other listed region), only in other regions insofar as they compare to Manchester.\n\nI went to the source (Generation Rent) and opened up their data on a computer (since the xlsx-html hide column headers on mobile), switched to the real xlsx and got the headings “Council - Occasions paid an incentive - £ paid in incentives - Highest incentive (£)”. This gives us an average £2958 per ‘occasion paid an incentive’.\n\nWith a max payment of £5980, suggesting a fairly low spread, but can’t find info on exactly who was paid what or when, so 90% of those could have gone to single landlord (unlikely, but possible) over 1138 'occasions’ (best guess, that’s 1138 people or families homed by a landlord who otherwise wouldn’t have let to them because of uncertainty).\n\nFor comparison, the total fund would buy 13-14 'average’ Manchester houses, to bring back into public ownership, or could maybe build 15-20 new houses owned publicly from scratch.\n\nI also put together a 'rough’ estimate of distribution based on reported figures just to inform context.\n\nFor total cost per resident, in Manchester, that’s about £6 each, or ~0.3% of council tax bill funded these incentives. This is slightly less than Enfield (the highest), about the same as Ealing, a little more than Nottingham, and substantially more than Birmingham (£1.45 tho I think that has a larger rural/suburban catchment area where these don’t really apply). London is around £5 per resident.\n\nThe original FOI for Manchester from Generation Rent is here. The wording suggests those occasions paid for 1131 people/families to be homed, but it is unclear about the details, I suspect it would need more FOIs to clarify.\n\n[imo] that seems mostly reasonable to me, but the total spend does support Generation Rent’s case that councils need more tools to use, 0.3% of total council tax paid isn’t nothing, but it’s not a 'tear down the council’ or 'eat all private landlords’ scale problem. Even if a small proportion of the 1000+ people or families are not sleeping on the streets, that’s a pretty good way to spend council money to avoid having to setup a thunderdome :)\n\nAs an unrelated aside, whenever you see “£X MILLIONS” in a headline… if the body of the article doesn’t contain some kind of per-capita or per-subject breakdown, that’s a journalistic failure, usually with the side-effect of creating outrage instead of communicating meaning. The Guardian used to be better than this, cos this type of headline especially belongs in a tabloid, not a real newspaper. Real data makes for real positive outcomes.\n\nWhy does this matter? Surely it’s just a nitpick? What does it matter if the scale isn’t reported? It’s still £3.35m, right?\nIt’s a fairly easy scale to identify, how many people did this money help home? Now we have at least a vague idea.\nIt also helps us identify what other solutions this could afford, and whether they would beat the current outcomes.\nIf you already got 'all the facts’ (or as many as you can), even if the facts don’t support your desired outcomes quite as enthusiastically as you’d prefer, you still have a case that’s harder to tear down or ignore.\nIt prevents readers lazily skipping to conclusions like “ban all private landlords” or “stop the council spending this money”, that make them feel better about complaining, but would harm real home-seekers if the council suddenly had to stop incentivising, but the actual proposal by Generation Rent was not actioned. If you solved the loud problem and not the quiet one, you just made a bigger problem for everybody.\nIt prevents (or at least discourages) 'ragers’ taking up all the oxygen, like on our original reference, the reddit thread. You can find this story in other city subreddits, and I expect on facebook too, with the same kneejerk reactions at various intensities. Placing the problem in context is crucial, or people will take whatever they want from your data, and you will have no way to stop them misrepresenting your objective or the positive outcomes.\nIt’s the right thing to do, even if it makes me look like a dick for nitpicking on bluesky :)\nTagged: #manchester, #council, #guardian, #journalistic malpractice, #ragebait, #clickbait, #journalism, #lazy, #renters, #council tax, #manchester city council\nPosted 2 days ago\nAI commercials don’t think you’re dumb, they’re just lying, legally\nAI ads are weird. Every time you see one, it’s an unimaginably low-stakes scenario: “learn some football bants”, “summarise an email”, “identify this fish”, “help me write a cute little note”. Exchanges so meaningless and empty, you wouldn’t even think to ask them.\n\nNobody actually uses gen AI like that, and everyone knows it, including the advertisers and platform decision-makers. People make fun of them as if the agencies are just clueless, like they genuinely believe the killer app for generative AI is party small talk. But that’s not what’s happening…\n\nThey can’t say what you actually use AI for. They can’t suggest “ask it about your mental health” or “do deep research on why my state just made this new draconian law” or “how do I expand my small business?” or even “how do I answer this email without sounding like a dickhead” and “my partner does this annoying thing, how do I deal with it?” (all common and well-recorded use cases, no moral judgment intended), because the moment they do, they open the entire organisation up to legal action. Visit the subreddit for basically any neurodiversity or mental-health issue, and you’ll find post after post of people using ChatGPT to deal with their problems, or just to feel better after a hard day, often with positive results. The corpos selling these genuinely useful services can’t focus on those though, because that comes with far more baggage than the organisation is willing to carry.\n\nHere are some examples: Google’s Gemini Super Bowl run with “Dream Job” and “Party Blitz” (The Verge, Google blog), Microsoft’s Copilot “Your everyday AI companion” Super Bowl ad and its “conversation starters” demos (CBS News, YouTube), Meta’s Ray-Ban Meta glasses Super Bowl campaign with Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt and the cringey “Parent Presentation” spot they pulled almost instantly (Meta, People, TidBITS, The Verge, Business Insider), OpenAI’s “The Intelligence Age” Super Bowl debut (OpenAI, Adweek, The Verge), and Anthropic’s five-second Claude bumper during the 2024 game (Axios).\n\nAI companies like to pretend that their biggest problem is “sometimes our responses contain innaccurate or out of date information”, and hedge/disclaim that right next to the main input textbox, and that’s generally what the press and outrage crowds tend to focus on how the AI can’t generate an accurate diagram of the female reproductive system, for example, but the real potential for harm of AI comes from when it technically can deliver information, but perhaps it shouldn’t, or even if it should, it’s still trusting you, the meatspace-based human, to action or implement based on its information reasonably, and not get mad (or litigious) if it all goes wrong.\n\nAn LLM can tell you to eat rocks, and that’s obviously stupid, but if it tells you to swallow your feelings and get on with your depressing job (even if it hedges a little), or you ask it about something uncomplicated, and its pursuit of balance or of avoiding being contentious/edgy responds with some advice that sounds good but isn’t if you think about it (because it’s trained largely on reddit/quora/etc which are full of terrible advice of their own forms), that’s an output of the system the organisation becomes liable for. So ads just pick the lowest possible stakes and pretend that’s all you’d ever use it for. If you use it for something else, that’s entirely on you.\n\nAI commercials don’t think you’re stupid, their internal data definitely shows them clearly what users are asking for, and if anything I suspect whoever at the marketing agency who puts these things out has said “people know what AI can actually do, they know these things would never happen like this” in a quiet meeting. I’d even bet the lawyers signing off on these ads know exactly what they’re doing, but as long as nobody admits it, there’s an entire system of legal defense that just keeps comfortably rolling along, trying to find new ways of taking your money by providing an always-on ‘e-friend’ who solves all your problems.\n\nTagged: #ai, #ads, #generative ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #gemini, #meta ai, #apple intelligence, #commercials, #marketing, #liability, #lawsuits, #bullshit, #lonliness, #lonely, #mental health\nPosted 3 days ago\nEveryone’s Wrong About How AI Works (Including Me)\nSo many people are so confidently wrong about how AI works that it actually makes me more confident the models’ own confidently-wrong output is based on real human input. They’re just reflecting us back at ourselves — smug mistakes in, smug mistakes out.\n\nAnd yeah, I’m in that pool too. I’ll happily waffle on about prompt clarity and outputs under load, and I’m happy to point and laugh at the vagina museum confidently claiming “That’s how LLMs work” in the middle of a thirty or forty tweet thread where every single post is weighed down with their own hallucinations and imaginative explanations with absolutely no connection to reality, because while everyone loves the vagina museum enough for tens of thousands of people to retweet and like their nonsense, literally nobody in their audience has any real idea how the tech works beyond ‘magic box that obviously can’t draw the female reproductive system’, because of course it can’t, that’s not what it’s for.\n\nI like to think (in a lazy crutch kind of way) of LLMs like a bag of scrabble tiles, and especially with images, you tip out the pieces and get mad that it doesn’t spell antidisestablishmentarianism, cos you’re pretty sure you put all the letters in.\n\nSometimes I think the most plausible explanation is that LLMs are just portals into some parallel dimension where an infinite sweatshop of overworked gig-econony ghostwriters are cranking out all our mediocre replies in some frozen time-space continuum. Honestly, if we discovered that tomorrow, nobody would even blink — it’d feel about right cos that’s how we build everything already anyway.\n\nAnd if we’re all going to be confidently wrong, maybe I should just choose to believe the whole thing runs on a single haunted qubit forming an einstein-rosen bridge in a basement somewhere. At least that’s a fun lie, and it’s not much more ridiculous than the reality of gazillions of grains of sand computing probability tables until they hit boundary conditions that collapse into a picture of a lizard lady with three tits or a screed about how AI works.\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #generativeai, #confidentlywrong, #altreality, #shitpost, #techhumour, #dead internet, #vibes, #rant, #skeets, #lol\nPosted 3 days ago\nOn the joy of being a bit of a dick to solve problems\nHad a couple of good work days, had a few projects come together into a cohesive set, and discovered I’m a pretty competent script-writer when I take the time to do a proper job — and the icing on the cake… My neighbour just told me she’s finally getting rid of her fucking cockerel. \\o/ [coming up Milhouse dot gif]\n\nAs a bonus: after weeks on a strict diet of mostly potatoes and bean mash, I’ve got snacks again 🤤\n\nAt the start of the year I promised myself I’d stop ignoring the little things that make life worse. Stop listening to the voice that says “just tolerate it, don’t be a dick.” Instead: fix them, nudge, ask, push a bit. Nothing massive, but just trying to solve these things is starting to pay off and my internal “am I being a dick?” counter has barely ticked up.\n\nIf I have any advice for tackling problems that aren’t your fault (those are a bit harder) it’s this: show people the evidence. A simple graph or log can make it obvious who the real dickhead is, and that’s harder to argue with than just venting.\n\nThe next project is pulling together GP practice reviews across a dozen sites run by the same management company, and comparing them to their competitors. Because sometimes the way you get change isn’t by ranting — it’s by drawing a chart that makes everyone else realise just how badly they’re failing, as long as you can present it in a way you’re confident is helpful and informative, and not just ranting.\n\nSometimes fixing life isn’t about grand revolutions. Sometimes it’s about fewer 5 a.m. cock-a-doodle-dos, and finally getting crisps back in your life. Small fixes, big difference.\n\nTagged: #small wins, #everyday life, #attention economy, #self maintenance, #fixing things, #mental health, #energy management, #petty victories, #bean mash life, #crisps, #neighbours, #sleep, #life hacks, #problem solving\nPosted 3 days ago\nAI doesn’t suck because the tech is bad\nAI doesn’t suck because it’s bad technology. On a good day, with low load, it’s barely distinguishable from magic. It sucks because its incredible power is so easy for people to use against you. All the stuff you’ve left online — the posts, the scraps, the off-hand comments — that’s ammo. And nobody else is going to clean it up. You have to.\n\nIf you’ve got any kind of digital footprint, try it. Open any LLM in a private chat, switch memory/history off, and just ask it about you. That’s the surface-level stuff it already knows. But if you really want to see what it can do, gather your posts like a scammer would, feed them in, and ask it to make assumptions. What do I like? What am I insecure about? What would I fall for? It doesn’t take much.\n\nChatGPT used to try and block this. It would stall or redirect. But since Grok launched, the guardrails have thinned out, and you can do it on either one now. The system message technically says “no personal data about anyone unless it’s public and relevant.” But that’s not an and, it’s an or. Make it public, or argue it’s relevant, and the model plays along. Strip out names, call it fiction, drop in a fake world — it still works. Those rules don’t protect you. They protect the platform’s lawyers.\n\nThis isn’t new either. The same advice applied back in 2011. I built a system for a major media org that scraped and connected data about their users and their families the old-fashioned way. We called it “the Facebook you don’t know you’re part of,” and eventually convinced management to kill it. For scope: the whole point was to sell cars to the wealthiest identifiable member of any household, based on their share history and a handful of behavioural assumptions. Off six or seven data points, it got the hierarchy right about ninety percent of the time. You are leaky.\n\nAnd here’s the thing: our system didn’t even need social media, and it only took a few devs a few months to build. Then one day we added a small feature that suddenly made it so invasive we all just looked at each other and realised we couldn’t ship it. Because the org wasn’t evil, management agreed. It was disturbingly easy to build, and could have been a secret nightmare. I still remember the look on one manager’s face when we explained it — we made it sound difficult and expensive, but he was excited anyway. Most of the rest were horrified. Luckily there were too many layers of management to ship it then, but plenty of others in companies all over the world picked up the baton and sprinted full pelt until they couldn’t sprint any faster… then they needed more, and now we have LLMs.\n\nI haven’t tried (yet), but I reckon with the right phrasing to avoid the weak guardrails (pretend you only want to build it about yourself maybe), you could ask Grok to recreate the whole thing today. And it’d probably do a decent job on the very first try — especially if you had a specific target in mind.\n\nSo yeah. The tech works. It’s almost magic when it isn’t under load. That’s the problem though, if you don’t clean up your trail, the techbros are going to ingest it (if they haven’t already) and it’s going to follow you, because your info is being worked into the models beneath the models (GPT-5 already layering on top of old models, and as above, so below, you’re stuffed in the catacombs). It’s not like google search where you can just file a request to have your database row deleted, there’s no getting it out, what you have online today is what you’ll be known for, forever.\n\nGPT-5 system messages, ish\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #grok, #chatgpt, #privacy, #dead internet, #data, #safety, #tech rant, #generative ai, #communication, #genai, #politics, #personal data\nPosted 3 days ago with 3 notes\nNobody at YouTube Watches YouTube\nI know this because of something so stupid it borders on parody. The YouTube TV app — which is basically the same web client everywhere now — still doesn’t remember if you want subtitles on. Every single time you open it, or even when it nudges you to re-select your profile after being idle, you have to go dig into menus, find the CC toggle they’ve buried deeper with each redesign, and turn captions back on.\n\nIn 2025, in homes where kids are running around, people are multitasking, and half the viewing is with the volume down, subtitles aren’t an “edge case.” They’re baseline. They’re also not just about convenience — they’re about accessibility. If you’re hard of hearing, you literally can’t use the app properly without turning CC on every time. That’s not a quirk. That’s a broken product.\n\nAnd it’s not like this hasn’t been raised. Hard-of-hearing communities have been complaining to deaf ears (lol) for years. Anyone who watches TV with captions would notice in about thirty seconds. There are at least thirty or forty real people in the YouTube product and design chain who could have caught this, flagged it, or fixed it with probably a single line of code. Instead, it’s been ignored, and in their latest “big refresh” they somehow made it worse.\n\nWhich leads me back to the claim. If even one decision-maker at YouTube — from the lowest PM to the highest-paid boardroom executive — actually relied on captions at home, this wouldn’t still be a problem. The only plausible explanation is that none of them do. That’s the only way something this obvious survives multiple product cycles.\n\nAnd that’s what really gets me. As a designer, it’s not just annoying — it’s insulting. It’s a reminder that the platform with a monopoly on so much creative culture is run by people who don’t use it the way most of us do. The people making the calls aren’t living with the same pain points, so those problems never get solved. They’re invisible at the top, glaring everywhere else.\n\nAnd sure — in the grand scheme of YouTube’s endless list of backwards decisions and neglected features, this is a small one. But it’s also telling. If they can’t be bothered to fix the basics, what chance is there they’ll tackle the bigger failures?\n\nSomeone really does need to disrupt YouTube.\n\nTagged: #youtube, #design, #accessibility, #enshittification, #subtitles, #rant, #deafawareness, #deafculture, #hard of hearing\nPosted 6 days ago\nCrypto Seems Stupid, But It Solves a Problem (Just Probably Not for You, Yet)\nCrypto as an industry is stupid. Let’s get that out of the way. It’s a clown car of scams, cult vibes, and half-baked libertarian fantasies about freedom without responsibility. It is, in the broadest sense, ridiculous.\n\nBut here’s the awkward bit: it actually does solve a problem. Just not your problem. At least, not yet.\n\nThe Problem Nobody Wants to Admit\nThe money layer of the internet isn’t neutral. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal — these aren’t just pipes you can pour payments through. They’re gatekeepers, and they know it. They’ve cut off porn platforms. They’ve throttled sex educators. They’ve quietly shut down queer creators, kink communities, even writers who looked too adjacent to the “wrong” politics.\n\nAnd now it’s games too — recent reporting shows Steam and Itch have both been pressured by payment processors (last I read, they denied it). Even entirely normal hustles and small creators get hit, sometimes just for TOS violations or false flags. People lose their income overnight, with no recourse, because some fringe product or anonymous report tripped a system designed to protect the most powerful customers, not the real people using it.\n\nWhy Crypto Looks Like the Wrong Answer\nCrypto has earned its reputation. Scams, pump-and-dumps, rug-pulls, and plenty of users who talk like failed cult leaders. It’s been lumped in with the dark web since the start. While it does enable shady stuff, it doesn’t have to enable only that.\n\nAnd despite the myths, most crypto isn’t really anonymous; they’re pseudonymous. Every transaction is public, forever. If investigators already have a thread, they can pull it.\n\nThen there’s the energy debate. Proof-of-work mining is wasteful, sure — but newer tokens don’t drink the ocean. Even with the worst offenders, the problem often comes down to bad infrastructure and perverse incentives. Companies like Nvidia have no reason to reinvent chips when the old ones sell fine. The system rewards inefficiency because that’s what pays.\n\n…But It Does Fix This One\nHere’s the rub: if you’re a sex worker suddenly cut off from payment processors, or a queer creator flagged as “brand unsafe,” or someone whose platform got kneecapped because Stripe panicked about “reputational risk,” crypto might be your only option left standing.\n\nStablecoins in particular are boring, which is exactly what you want from money. They let people send and receive without begging permission from a boardroom of executives who’ve never heard of you and wouldn’t admit they canceled you even if you asked. Yes, the current US administration is fumbling regulation in a way that makes stablecoins look like just another scam coin. But some form of responsible regulation would be welcome — and overdue.\n\nAnd you don’t have to use Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or whatever fresh coin the nerds are yelling about this week (hint, it’s 99.9% probably a scamcoin if it’s come out in the last few years). As long as everyone involved agrees it’s pretty stable, or you’re in and out quickly (or comfortable holding volatility in your pocket), any token will do. The nerds deserve mockery for their blind optimism, but they’re not entirely wrong that used responsibly, it has value.\n\nThe “Yet”\nMaybe that’s not your problem. Maybe you’ve got a regular job, a respectable bank account, and no reason to worry about whether your income stream will vanish overnight because some corpo compliance reviewer didn’t like the shape of your business.\n\nBut the choke point isn’t theoretical. It’s already here. Entire groups are being financially deplatformed right now. Maybe you don’t need crypto — until suddenly you do.\n\nPay Attention\nNobody’s asking you to jump in with both feet. But understand what it actually is because maybe one day you’ll need it — or maybe a creator you like will get cut off, and you’ll want a way to slip them some support.\n\nThis matters more as platforms corporate-ize. YouTube, Twitch, Patreon — all of them focus on fewer, bigger players once the VC money takes the reins. It happened in microstock: the floor kept rising until most contributors were shoved into the basement to fight over scraps.\n\nCrypto isn’t utopia. It won’t buy you coffee at Starbucks anytime soon (or at least not outside of the valley). But for all its absurdity, it’s one of the very few escape hatches left in a financial system that wants everything channeled between two high walls, sterile and market-ready, like pigs driven to slaughter.\n\nYou don’t have to like it. You don’t even have to use it. But it already exists, and it already works. It costs you basically nothing to understand the option — and you might be glad you did.\n\nTagged: #crypto, #cryptocurrency, #bitcoin, #ethereum, #stablecoins, #fintech, #financial censorship, #deplatformed, #payment processors, #mutual aid, #swers, #sexwork, #queer creators, #adult content, #censorship, #platform politics, #compliance capitalism, #tech rant\nPosted 1 week ago\nWhy you should use AI for art\nGen AI’s uptake has been wild, even though it’s far from a perfect tool. It’s already fucked over a million or more commercial artists worldwide by swamping every once-viable digital content market with slop. And it’s not just because the tools are bad—most “hustlers” trying to make hay while the sun shines (think markets like KDP, POD, or microstock, though the last one’s less “swamped” and more out-competed by free crappy images of whatever you can imagine) haven’t really reacted to the influx yet.\n\nMy main issue isn’t with AI adoption overall. I think it’s been over-adopted long before it’s actually good, but it is already occasionally useful when deployed in the right places and the right ways—as a tool that multiplies force, not as a worker replacement.\n\nThe problem’s with the irresponsible adoption: platforms that can’t tell the difference between slop and real value, and the absence of systems to determine that, because they’re too busy trying to leverage gen AI themselves, and not busy enough preventing exploitation by it. Eventually, those platforms will have to catch up or die.\n\nThere’s an argument about gen AI where it doesn’t belong, like spewing bullshit onto social media. But the biggest problem isn’t that they “stole” literally every image they could find to build the systems in the first place—regulators are now letting them get away with it, because it technically doesn’t violate copyright.\n\nCopyright’s on the exact words you used, not the style of words you tend toward; on the exact brush strokes, not your general use of phthalo blue (or however you spell it) and a palette knife. Likewise, intellectual property is the names and places in your world, not that you tend to set scenes in space with a big-titted lizard lady and a talking cat. People got mad at something nobody saw coming, so it’s not surprising there weren’t really any tools to stop it.\n\nAnyway, onto my story.\nThe short version: once upon a time, I was a microstock photographer and illustrator (a mediocre one, that’s fine, not everybody has to be Picasso). Eventually, loosely a video-illustrator of sorts (shaders to video). Going into around 2016 with somewhere near 10,000 pieces of content in my portfolio—not exactly earning a strong living, but earning enough to have been worth the time to make them. Well, microstock fell off a cliff (at least for me and everyone except the top 3% of producers) as the market consolidated (I won’t get into microstock history, but it was once a thriving industry). The better producers out-competed me (fairly), the agencies hoovered up or destroyed each other, and Unsplash and co came along and took the edge cases and convenience users, dropping my income to 20% of the peak. Even after adding 15,000 videos or so to my portfolio, that started okay, then dipped too as the agencies who ingested it struggled to keep them relevant or I got outcompeted in their algorithms.\n\nSo I shifted into print on demand. I lost track of how many designs in my portfolios years ago, but I’m pretty sure it’s at least half a million overall, maybe more—I honestly have no idea. My designs are basic, but I made them all myself, with the aid of scripts and tools I built, and put in the legwork to tag them and upload them. They paid a little… until gen AI came along (what, like 2021?) and bam, all of a sudden print on demand wasn’t viable cos every store—Cafepress, Teepublic, Redbubble, Spreadshirt, Zazzle, and I’m sure half a dozen I’ve forgotten—all got swamped by pretty poor quality, but technically passable free upsized Stable Diffusion characters with too many fingers and not enough characters in the text. But customers aren’t that bothered if all they want is a mug that says “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my morning cock” for less than twenty bucks. So POD dropped to 10% of its peak too (maybe less by now, I don’t bother to check anymore)…\n\nI actively encourage artists, especially those who once earned a real living, to use whatever AI tools they want or need to—to make up for their loss in sales, to leverage for more work, for happier clients, for faster throughput. Because commercial art isn’t always about being the best; it’s often just about getting enough work done in each new day to keep the lights on and the Photoshop subscription paid (I’ll cover this another day).\n\nWhen these whining kids on social media get triggered by a lazy article that has a “not just x, but y” conceit or an image of Sonic with too many fingers (does Sonic even have fingers?), because they feel like it stole their furry fan art from those 2 images they were proud of posting on Tumblr 10 years ago, I don’t give a fuck…\n\nThe entire market for commercial art got wiped out time and time again, and people have been stealing my images on the internet this entire millennium, and I never complained about it because that’s what the internet is. It’s stealing the Sonic IP so you can have him kissing a real girl in your lazy fanfic if you want to. And getting triggered at regular people just discovering the joy of creation for the first time—because they weren’t raised with enough time or energy to get into making their own work when they were entitled kids…\n\nI say let them make whatever trash they want with AI, let Disney cram it into every corner they want to, and I’ll gladly look at and maybe even enjoy it, because art isn’t just the execution, art is the idea\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #aiuptake, #commercialart, #microstock, #pod, #kdp, #artists, #slop, #hustlers, #platforms, #copyright, #generative ai, #disney, #ai, #business, #commercial, #stock photography\nPosted 1 week ago\nWhy is everyone so mad about asylum hotels?\nI didn’t understand this issue very well, so I did a deep dive, and here’s what I learned…\n\nIf you’ve read the headlines lately, you’d think local councils are writing cheques to Premier Inn and Travelodge for thousands of asylum seekers. That’s not actually true — but the reality is messier, and that’s why everyone’s shouting past each other.\n\nWho really pays for hotels?\nThe hotel contracts are signed and paid for by the Home Office — not your local council. The National Audit Office (NAO) sets this out clearly in its work on the Home Office’s asylum accommodation contracts (NAO briefing, May 2025). In 2023/24, the Home Office expected to spend £4.7bn on asylum support, including £3.1bn on hotels (NAO report, Mar 2024). In 2024/25, hotel spending ran at about £108m per month — roughly £1.3bn for the year (Reuters fact check, Jun 2025; see also NAO, May 2025).\n\nSo why are councils angry?\nBecause while they don’t pay the hotel bill, they do pay for everything that comes with it:\n\nSchools and childcare, safeguarding and social care.\nHousing and homelessness support when people leave hotels — whether granted status or evicted.\nLocal services like waste collection, environmental health and community safety.\nThe Local Government Association says councils receive no funding for hotels and want the same per‑bed support that exists for other accommodation types (LGA briefing, May 2024). Case in point: Hillingdon reports a £5m annual pressure linked to supporting people leaving hotels, with a cumulative shortfall over £16m (Hillingdon Council, Jul 2025). Glasgow forecast £26.5m of asylum‑related costs in 2024/25 (Glasgow City HSCP paper, Jan 2025).\n\nThis all lands after a decade of squeezed local budgets. Independent analysis shows core local government spending remains below 2010/11 in real terms (Institute for Government, Jul 2024; see also NAO, Feb 2025).\n\nWhy did the central bill drop?\nNot because the Home Office suddenly got efficient. The drop is mainly from using fewer hotels, packing more people into remaining sites, and shifting to cheaper options like large sites or other accommodation models. The NAO documents hotel closures and plans to reduce reliance on them (NAO report, Mar 2024). The Migration Observatory estimates hotel accommodation averaged about £170 per person per night in 2024/25 — far more than other options (Migration Observatory, Aug 2025). The House of Commons Library explains the policy shift to barges and large sites to cut hotel use (Commons Library, Jul 2023).\n\nWhy are councils going to court now?\nRecent legal challenges (like the Epping case) argue hotels can’t be repurposed this way without planning permission. That’s about where hotels are used, not ending hotel use everywhere. After the High Court ruling, the government said it would appeal and manage closures “in an orderly way” (Reuters, Aug 2025; also Guardian, Aug 2025).\n\nDo councils get any central funding at all?\nYes, but it’s fragmented and often doesn’t match actual local costs. Examples include the Asylum Dispersal Grant and Move On Grant funding instructions to local authorities (GOV.UK Dispersal Grant 2025–26; GOV.UK Move On Grant, Mar 2025). The LGA continues to push for proper funding tied to the pressures councils face (LGA campaign explainer).\n\nWhy “Stop the Boats” is such a stupid slogan\n“Stop the Boats” sounds simple, but it’s an undeliverable demand. Britain has no jurisdiction over where the boats set off from, no control over the wars, persecution, or other disasters that push people onto them, and no runway left in the countries of origin after decades of bombing, interventions, and half‑baked foreign policy. You can’t stop people fleeing danger with a soundbite.\n\nThat’s why it works politically: it’s a perfect wedge issue. It promises a solution that can’t be delivered, so whichever government fails can be painted as weak, and whichever opportunist shouts loudest can look like a saviour. Even if they took power, they’d be in the same situation — the only policies left would be cruel, extreme, and harmful to everyone involved.\n\nA better approach would be the opposite: quicker and fairer asylum decisions, investment in schools, health centres and libraries to support both new arrivals and existing residents, and proper public spending that strengthens communities. Building capacity is a force multiplier. It helps everyone.\n\nSo who’s really footing the bill?\nAll of us. The Home Office still spends billions centrally on hotels and asylum support (see NAO above). Councils then pay for the knock‑on local costs — with some grants, but large gaps remaining. That means council tax rises and service cuts are still on the table in many areas (IFS, Jun 2024; Commons Library, Jul 2025). The numbers move around, but the bill never disappears.\n\nImmigration isn’t the root of all our problems though, it’s barely even visible in the budget.\n\nimage\nPeople are angry… Some are angry for stupid racist reasons, some because they just don’t want to hear foreign on the bus or are terrified of muslims after decades of demonisation, some because their councils are broke and the general sense of social rot is spreading, and some because the whole thing feels like a giant shell game where the poorest communities always end up carrying the weight.\n\nThe overall cost just isn’t that much compared to the many many other problems that its convenient for the halls of power to pretend aren’t there, because most people have never seen what the budget really looks like, so of course they’re going to be easier to deal with if they’re not complaining about real problems, but instead complaining about problems you could fix for the cost of a couple of hospitality villages if you really wanted it to go away.\n\nThis Labour government seems unable to raise taxes in the places that would raise funds, won’t means-test the largest expenditures (like the pension, even though it could save £25 billion for a cost of less than half a billion), won’t pursue tech companies or multinationals who export wealth, won’t push any policies that might stunt ‘growth’ (despite there being little to no evidence for it), and have no power to establish new exports as more money leaves local economies than flow into them, but let’s not make this about Brexit ;)\n\nThe short version is, immigrants of any kind are not a big line item in anyone’s budget, the costs are tiny in reality, but they’re an easy target, vulnerable, visible, and all the answers are way more complicated than they seem if all you hear/read are soundbites from Farage and his fellow opportunists, or headlines from any news source that has an interest in pretending it’s simple so they can offer the most appealing answers.\n\nTagged: #asylum, #immigration, #refugees, #stoptheboats, #ukpolitics, #councils, #austerity, #racism, #publicservices, #housingcrisis, #shellgame, #wedgepolitics, #community, #stop the boats, #britain\nPosted 1 week ago\nCancel Culture has never cancelled anyone*\nCancel culture doesn’t exist.

Her career was already fading, the jail stint shot it full of life, and she’s been riding that wave ever since, cooking shows and memes and a Snoop Dogg side-hustle that made her cooler than she ever was before.\n\nEveryone else? Cancellation is just another visibility bump. A career pivot. A rebrand. The “left” pretend it’s justice, the “right” scream it’s exile — but look around. The bellends in question faced no real consequence beyond a sabbatical followed by another paycheck. To actually stay cancelled you’ve got to be properly heinous, AND an utter prick to work with. Otherwise? You’re not cancelled. You’re trending.\n\nTagged: #cancelculture, #culturewar, #bellends, #celebs, #justice, #prison, #fakeconsequences, #rant\nPosted 1 week ago\nManchester’s real problems\nThis city’s been falling apart for years and everyone can see it:\n\nHomelessness everywhere, people failed at every step by the systems that were supposed to help them.\nA council that’s underfunded, occasional corrupt, and often incompetent.\nRoads that are a wreck, litter and vandalism everywhere, fly tipping left to rot.\nPost-pandemic selfishness and carelessness like nobody gives a toss about living in a shared place.\nRising poverty and joblessness.\nPiccadilly gardens terrifying visitors and locals\nGentrification and bad planning doubling (or even tripling) rents, and house prices through the roof\nBuses run by drivers with barely any experience, a danger to everyone else on the road.\nInfrastructure that’s crap and crumbling.\nGPs collapsing under systemic failure, leaving the most desperate with no mental health support at all, and at best the bare minimum of reactive healthcare that usually comes years later than it should, if at all.\nStreets full of comatose druggies, almost all of them locals, abandoned by the same systems that were meant to stop this happening.\nThese are the actual problems. The things that make life worse for people here every single day. Instead the noise is all about “stop the boats.”, despite immigration costs being barely 2%-3% (much less, like way below 1% if you only consider ‘illegals’ or 'irregular migration’ if you prefer corpo-speak) of the budget.\n\nThe flag-shaggers terrorising immigrants in this city aren’t helping — they’re making everything worse. We can’t do anything about the boats, we don’t control where they come from. And yeah, asylum needs fixing — but it should be funded centrally, not dumped on local councils that can’t even fix a pothole after years of Tory cuts. And it sure as hell shouldn’t be public money lining hotel chains’ pockets to lock vulnerable people up like prisoners.\n\nThe whole thing is just a wedge issue. A distraction. Designed to keep people snapping at each other while the real enemies — the corporate interests and wealth hoarders — strip this city bare and laugh at us for falling for it.\n\nLabour came in promising to help people, and just ran riot over the country with more Tory-lite policy, keeping their gerry-mandering and mandatory photo ID discouraging poorer voters from having any say in change. It’s not surprising Reform are gaining ground because we’re ALL sick of it, wherever you land on the political spectrum.\n\nInstead of screaming at each other over boats we can’t control, we should be screaming at the people who do control things here: the ones running this city into the ground. Demand better housing, proper funding for people who need it most, working public services, safe roads, real mental health care. That’s not left or right, and certainly not a 'culture’ problem.\n\nTagged: #manchester, #homelessness, #poverty, #nhs collapse, #infrastructure, #gentrification, #class war, #refugees welcome\nPosted 1 week ago\nGenerative AI and the Illusion of Work\nGenerative AI isn’t just a tool, it’s a form of intellectual retail therapy — the sense of progress without the pain of actual delivery.\n\nFor those of us with projectitis — always starting, rarely finishing — the fit is perfect. Fire off a prompt, get back an outline, a roadmap, a code scaffold. It feels like momentum. It looks like work. But it’s no different to shuffling your to-do list: activity disguised as progress.\n\nThe machine is tuned for this. Every output arrives padded with positive reinforcement. “Here’s your great idea, made real.” That little surge of satisfaction is the same feedback loop that keeps social media addictive. You don’t need to publish, launch, or finish anything. You just need to ask, and you’re rewarded with the feeling of accomplishment.\n\nGPT-5 stripped out much of the fawning affirmation, and suddenly people who’d been using it as an emotional support device felt the loss, not just of its warmth, but of its comforting reassurance that you’re great.\n\nGenerative AI is excellent at massaging your brain into believing you’re productive. But believing isn’t the same as doing. It’s a mirror that flatters, not a partner that delivers.\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #chatgpt, #productivity, #procrastination, #projectitis, #illusionofwork, #llms, #artificialintelligence, #dopamine, #techculture\nPosted 2 weeks ago\nBuying Games for the Shelf\nWe’re living in a FOMO bubble. Not the dot-com (lol), not the housing market (tho we are) — but lower-stakes digital backlog bubble. People are buying games they never play, stacking them hundreds deep in their libraries, just to have them available.\n\nThe numbers make it clear:\n\nOn PC, surveys show 24% of owned games are never played at all. Steam’s own data has clocked it higher, with ~37% of registered games never even launched.\nEven when people do launch a game, they often don’t stick. Achievement unlock rates show the drop-off. On Xbox, only 52% of players beat the first boss in Hellblade II; in Starfield, 25% never even reached space. In Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, 43% never left the tutorial country. Steam and PlayStation tend to fare better — but the pattern holds.\nIt’s not literally “90% don’t clear the first hurdle,” but the drop-off is still brutal. Between a quarter who never play at all and another 40–60% who stall before the first proper chapter, you’re looking at the overwhelming majority never making it past the opening act. And that’s staggering when you think about how much money changes hands just to dabble.\n\nNow zoom out. The global games market in 2024 hit $182.7 billion. Mobile is about half of that ($92B), console another quarter ($51B), and PC the rest (~$43B). Of that, somewhere between 40% and 55% — $70 to $100 billion — comes directly from time-limited monetisation. Battle passes, seasonal events, gacha banners, rotating cosmetic shops. FOMO by design.\n\nThat’s the real engine: not just buying to play, but buying so you don’t miss out. Buying because the skin is only here this week, because the pass expires in 30 days, because if you don’t grab it now, it’s gone.\n\nPut it together and you’ve got a market propped up by two linked illusions:\n\nIllusion of intent: people think they’ll play the games they buy. Half don’t.\nIllusion of scarcity: people think they’ll miss out if they don’t buy now. Often they won’t.\nIf you’re the kind of player who buys FIFA every year, or drops sixty or seventy bucks on the latest Call of Duty or Assassin’s Creed and spends the next twelve months slowly working through it, you’re probably getting your money’s worth. The economics make sense. But the moment you’ve got a backlog — even a modest one — the numbers go sideways. You’re almost certainly spending at least double what you should, and for plenty of people with hundreds of unplayed games in their libraries, it’s many times more than that.\n\nGames are fun, sure. People still sink hundreds of hours into the big ones. But the industry is running on backlog economics and FOMO fuel. It’s a strange kind of bubble: the value isn’t in what you play, but in what you buy and never touch.\n\nMaybe it bursts one day, maybe it doesn’t. What’s certain is that subscription platforms like Game Pass add another layer of pressure: developers now have to build for discovery churn as much as for play. That’s fine if you’re Ubisoft and can pump out an Assassin’s Creed every other year with DLC on top, but for smaller studios the bubble is harsher. They can pivot fast, sure, but one flop in a backlog-driven, subscription-shaped market can still wipe them out.\n\nTagged: #gaming, #videogames, #backlog, #steam, #xbox, #playstation, #gamepass, #fomo, #dlc, #subscription\nPosted 2 weeks ago with 1 note\nDiplomatic Incompetence\nAt my recent GP’s patient participation meeting (trying to get them to fix their many problems), several patients used the word incompetent about reception staff. Not careless, not under-trained — “incompetent”. The practice manager’s summary on wrap-up: “We’re facing training challenges.”\n\nI pushed back: “I think we said incompetent.” She replied: “I was being diplomatic.” Then we moved on…\n\nThat was probably sensible in the room (no need for the distraction over semantics). But here’s the thing: if you downgrade incompetence to a “training challenge,” you all but guarantee nothing will change. Training challenges are easy — PDF modules, refresher courses, maybe a workshop. Incompetence isn’t. Incompetence means people who are disengaged, burnt out, or actively hostile to the patients they’re supposed to help. You can’t train that away. You have to either change the system and the staff, or replace them. And that requires naming the problem honestly.\n\nThis isn’t just a healthcare thing. It’s the entire operating mode of UK Labour under Starmer. Every crisis is framed as a “challenge.” Structural wealth extraction? A productivity challenge. Exploitation baked into gig work? A regulation challenge. House-building collapse? A planning challenge.\n\nEverything becomes small, manageable, “reasonable” — because the people at the top are too busy being diplomatic to those with power to risk saying what’s true: these aren’t challenges, they’re rot. And rot doesn’t shift because you call it something nicer.\n\nYou can train through a challenge. You can’t workshop incompetence.\n\nTagged: #politics, #uk, #labour, #corpospeak, #healthcare\nPosted 2 weeks ago\nAI Isn’t Draining the Colorado River — Your Politics Are\nIt’s interesting how pros have been patiently explaining how data centres and AI actually use water, but because everyone’s so deeply triggered, it’s become fashionable to pretend that generating a single image of a lizard warrior with five tits is single-handedly draining the Colorado River.\n\nAs if decades of infrastructure neglect, perverse incentives for private land management, hands-off regulation, and the chronic inability to fund the projects experts actually recommended had nothing to do with why water’s short in half the western world, even without considering climate change.\n\nBut that’s not the story the mainstream press wants. They’ll pull out the lowest-value, dumbest possible inclusion from a mostly sensible report, slap a rage-bait headline on it, and rake in the clicks.\n\nThe press are too busy trying to get the eyes-on their website, they let the serious, boring failures slide.

Too much news, too much noise, too much “urgent” stuff that — if you squint — turns out to be neither urgent nor stuff.\n\nIt’s not that none of it matters. It’s that your attention is finite, and the world will gladly burn it on things you can’t change, can’t fix, or don’t actually care about once you stop doomscrolling.\n\n1. Is this a thing I can change?\nIf no — park it. Read about it if it’s interesting, but don’t burn emotional fuel on it. Awareness does not equal responsibility.\n\n2. Is this a thing that actually affects me or people I care about?\nIf it’s happening in a domain where I have zero stake and zero influence, it’s probably not my fire to fight.\n\n3. Is the problem new, or just today’s flavour of an old one?\nIf it’s the same rot as last week but with a fresh headline, maybe I don’t need to rehearse my outrage again.\n\n4. Is there a source of truth I trust on this?\nIf all I’ve got is vibes, memes, and people yelling into feeds, maybe I don’t have enough to form a useful opinion yet.\n\n5. Will talking about it do anything?\nIf my words aren’t going to change the outcome — not even my own mindset — then maybe this is just venting. And that’s fine, but let’s call it what it is and be comfortable with that.\n\n6. Am I reacting to the thing, or to the way it’s being presented?\nA lot of what passes for “news” is just someone picking a camera angle for maximum twitch. Make sure the story, not the packaging, is what’s got my attention.\n\nYou can’t solve everything, you can’t even meaningfully track everything — but you can keep your focus for the things that are actually in your reach.\n\nThink of it like the Serenity Prayer, but without the theological framing:\nGrant me the clarity to see which fires are mine to fight, the focus to put my energy there, and the sense to ignore the rest before it eats my week.

Zeno imagined you could never actually arrive anywhere if you kept halving the distance: you walk halfway to the door, then half the remainder, then half that again… and in the perfect little vacuum of ancient philosophy, you spend forever inching forward without ever stepping over the threshold.\n\nIn the pub version, you’ve got a pint glass. You keep pouring in half of what’s left from another pint. Each pour gets smaller, cleaner, more precise — but the bastard glass never actually fills. It asymptotically approaches “full” without ever tipping over into frothy satisfaction.\n\nThat’s AI right now. Every upgrade, every model release, every breathless press cycle brings a smaller, cleverer pour. It’s nearly human, almost right, practically perfect — except for the missing teaspoon of sense, context, or detail that would actually make it whole. And because the gap keeps shrinking, the failure gets harder to point to without sounding petty.\n\nBut the gap never goes away. You can drink from it, sure, but you’ll always taste the absence. And that absence — tiny but terminal — is enough to keep it in the realm of “impressive tool” rather than “actual replacement.”\n\nIt’s a pint of promise, forever just shy of the rim. Can we make do, or do we need to wait for yet another never for the leap to come?\n\nTagged: #zenosparadox, #pints, #pubmaths, #generativeai, #llms, #asymptotic, #techrant, #philosophy, #computersarestupid, #ai, #almostbutnotquite, #publogic, #maths, #gap, #pubchat, #rant, #Ask ChatGPT\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nProfiling the Job Out of Existence? Not quite, but hmm\nAI’s earliest provable gains have mostly landed in the same places where “interaction profiling” could turn a human role into a near-fully automated pipeline. In other words, the jobs seeing the most benefit today may also be the first to face replacement tomorrow — not because AI is perfect, but because the work was already structured in a way that made it easy to replicate.\n\nIn practice, this works best where the inputs and outputs are consistent and the “human in the middle” mostly follows a known pattern. Roles like insurance claims handling, tier-1 customer service, compliance auditing, or simple bug triage all fit the bill. These are jobs that already run on a playbook, and AI tools are now proving they can run that playbook faster and cheaper.\n\nIf a company can log every query, prompt, edit, and output from an AI-assisted worker, it can build a profile of how that person does the job. With enough history, that profile stops being just analytics and starts becoming a template. Feed that into a fine-tuned model, wrap it in some orchestration to run on a schedule or trigger from events, and you have a “synthetic worker” that covers 90–95% of the original role.\n\nFrom there, it’s just gap-filling: a smaller human team handles exceptions, phone calls, and anything too complex or sensitive for the bot. One person supervising the edge-cases of ten digital clones is an attractive equation for management — especially in cost-sensitive industries where output is easy to measure and errors are cheap to fix.\n\nThat doesn’t make mass replacement inevitable. Many (responsible) companies would rather keep the headcount and use the efficiency gains to increase profits, throughput or service levels. But in roles that already fit the automation mould, the path from “AI-assisted” to “AI-replaced” is pretty short. It’s not quite the man who feeds the dog to stop him touching the machine, but it’s on approach.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #coding, #chatgpt, #communication\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nWhere Are the Big AI Wins?\nI’ve been wondering why we aren’t hearing more good news about AI adoption by now. With two or three years of mass LLM use, you’d expect plenty of “this tool changed our business” stories from companies that jumped in early—not just hype, not just speculative “future of work” thinkpieces.\n\nThere are some genuine wins.\n\nCoding assistants like GitHub Copilot have solid evidence behind them. In controlled trials, developers finished tasks over 50% faster, with companies reporting 10–25% more code shipped to production. Gains are biggest for less experienced devs, but seniors get a speed boost too.\nWriting and content tasks benefit as well. Experiments show professionals completing work 40% faster and with higher quality ratings when assisted by ChatGPT.\nCustomer support has clear wins: one Fortune 500 call centre saw a 14% productivity lift, 34% for new hires, and fewer escalations after adding AI agent-assist tools.\nIn finance and insurance, some firms are using GPT-based tools to slash claims processing from an hour to ten minutes, or to cut audit costs by 90%+.\nThat’s the provable stuff—measurable, replicable, and tied directly to the AI being in place.\n\nThen there’s the other end of the spectrum:\n\nAgent mode—letting AI run complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human oversight—mostly outputs wrong or off-target work. Looks busy, delivers headaches.\nCreative “revolution” hasn’t happened. No AI-only bestsellers, blockbuster films, or award-winning ad campaigns. Plenty of experiments and gimmicks, little consistent commercial payoff.\nLots of companies claim “transformative” AI results but offer no data. Often these are vendor case studies that read more like marketing copy than independent proof.\nIn between are the early signals:\n\nBuzzFeed saw a 60% traffic boost from AI-generated quizzes, though long-term monetisation is unclear.\nAgencies and writers are using AI to brainstorm and draft faster, but outcomes still depend on heavy human shaping.\nMany organisations say they’re saving time in knowledge work, but without hard numbers or clear bottom-line impact—yet.\nOverall, the case for moderate optimism is there. The tech already works in certain contexts, and even agent mode is barely a year old. But if AI was truly delivering across the board, we’d be drowning in positive case studies. Most companies don’t actually want “half the staff, same profits”—they’d prefer “same staff, double profits.” That means the biggest adoption pressure will come in fields where people can prove AI delivers practical, repeatable gains.\n\nRight now, those fields exist, but they’re thinner on the ground than the hype suggests.\n\nTagged: #genai, #llms, #generative ai, #success\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nWhy Conservatives Hate Porn, Really\nConservative censorship of sexual content doesn’t prevent abuse—it enables it. Porn isn’t a substitute for sex education, but in many environments it’s the only thing available. And when you deliberately deny people access to information about sex, consent, and bodily autonomy, you don’t create purity—you create victims.\n\nThat’s not an accident. It’s a strategy.\n\nEasily accessible pornography—despite being non-educational—is often the only exposure many people have to sex, bodies, and consent.\n\nThis exposure, flawed as it is, still provides more sexual literacy than the willful vacuum created by conservative censorship.\n\nPorn as Default Sex Ed\nIn the absence of real sex education, porn becomes the primary (sometimes only) source of information about sex for young people.\nWhile distorted, it still communicates basic ideas: what genitals look like, that sex exists, that desire exists, that women can enjoy sex.\nThat baseline awareness is more than the total ignorance enforced by abstinence-only frameworks.\nSexual Ignorance is a Tool of Control\nConservative moral panic about pornography and sexual content is not about protecting anyone—it’s about maintaining ignorance and shame.\nAn uninformed population—especially women—is easier to coerce, silence, and abuse.\nWhen people don’t understand their own bodies, rights, or consent, they’re more vulnerable.\nCensorship Increases Harm\nEfforts to ban porn, restrict sex ed, and criminalize expression (e.g., book bans, internet filters) do not reduce harm—they increase it.\nRestricting sex education correlates with higher teen pregnancy, STD transmission, and sexual violence.\nThe conservative agenda is not merely prudish—it’s strategically regressive, with measurable real-world harm.\nIntentionality\nAt a certain point, the consistent, data-ignoring push for censorship becomes indistinguishable from intent.\nIf harm is predictable and sustained, and policies never change, then harm is either the goal or an accepted price for maintaining power.\nEvery time we see these ‘conservative groups’ winning in the name of purity, remember their goal is ignorance, they stand for precisely what they claim to stand against.\n\nTagged: #porn, #adult, #conservatives, #christian, #sa\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nYouGov Finds 45% of Brits Are Idiots\nTurns out nearly half the UK supports the idea of mass migrant removals. Not just “stop the boats” nonsense — actual, large-scale deportations of people already here. That number jumps to 86% for Reform UK voters, but includes about a quarter of Labour and Lib Dem voters too. Grim.\n\nBut here’s the kicker: it’s based on pure fiction.\n\nMost people backing mass deportations think the majority of migrants are here illegally. They’re wrong. The illegal population is somewhere between 120k and 1.3 million. The legal migrant population? Over 10 million. So what the 45% are really saying is, “We want loads of people gone — but we don’t know who, or why, and we’re not going to check.”\n\nWhen asked about specific migrant groups (e.g. doctors, legal asylum seekers, skilled workers), that same crowd suddenly backpedals. Support drops like a rock. The only consistent “yes, deport them” groups are the tabloid bogeymen: benefits claimants, small boat arrivals, unskilled workers without visas.\n\nSo the public thinks it supports mass deportation, but only because it’s got the wrong end of the stick jammed directly up its own newsfeed. YouGov ran trade-off scenarios — what if deporting people hurts the NHS? Or the economy? Or reduces tax revenue? The answers showed public opinion is built on vibes, not outcomes.

Where art, speech, community, and identity still technically happen, but always under the watchful eye of monetization risk. Where platforms encourage you to be “authentic” while quietly penalizing anything too real, too raw, or too noncommercial.\n\nWhere racists and scammers, bots and trolls can fly by night under fake photo scans and temporary appearance of compliance, while sowing rot from the inside out, but the business model already shifted to helping the rot grow because that’s where the sun is shining in the quarterly reports..\n\nTentacular… It’s not dead. It’s not hollow. It’s Blighted, rotting under the weight of the parasite that’s infested its network of wire with its own tendrils dripping bias and hate, ignorant over-reaction or poorly-fitting incompatible dream.\n\nHeld hostage by ad revenue, payment processors, investor pressure, and legal panic. Every platform wants to be the space where culture happens — but none want to take responsibility for what that culture says, or who it threatens, how it refuses to behave or what fluid masses of hate it will enable.\n\nSo they extract. They monetize. They whisper about “creator empowerment” while building systems that nerf reach, demonetize nuance, and algorithmically quarantine risk. Not because they hate users — but because they fear becoming liable for them.\n\nThis is cowardice at scale. More than just censorship from governments. More than mobs with pitchforks. Self-inflicted restrictions from billion-dollar companies scared of looking like publishers, scared of lawsuits, scared of regulators — and more than anything, scared of the advertisers who believe their false promises of impressions, when 90%+ of those are siphoned (far beyond the original half advertisers already know they lose).\n\nUsers create value for free\nPlatforms monetize without liability\nAdvertisers fund only what flatters them\nPayments enforce moral compliance at the financial layer\nAnd when something goes wrong?

Porn sites (and others flagged for potential adult material) now have to verify users are over 18, including big implications for online gaming, so at some point Nintendo will probably want to scan your face for AI based Age Check, if they want to obey the law. Microsoft have already started.\n\nCue predictable issues: bypassable enforcement, data privacy risks, over-blocking—even YouGov’s own polling post was flagged as “pornographic” and hidden on X.\n\nBut here’s the interesting bit… YouGov’s follow-up poll shows 69% of Britons support the new rules.\n\nOnly 24% think they’ll work.\n\nSupport has dropped from 80% pre-launch, but that’s still a remarkable delta: nearly half of respondents back a measure they do not believe will be effective.\n\nSupport without belief. Compliance without confidence.\n\nIn raw numbers: 45% of people polled said, in effect, “Yes, this won’t work, but I’m for it anyway.”\n\nThat’s not policy, that’s just pandering.\n\nThere’s a familiar pattern here—one we’ve seen before in post-Brexit bureaucracy and post-empire decline. Performative governance. Rules designed for vibes. Solutions that fix nothing, but make a subset of angry, hateful or ignorant people feel seen. Or safe. Or heard.\n\nAnd opposition? That’s easy to paint as moral failure. If you criticise the rules, you must be for teenagers watching porn, right? You must be with Jimmy Saville, as Peter Kyle, so-called Technology Minister, claims. It doesn’t matter if the rules don’t work, if you disagree with them, you’re a monster, apparently.\n\nI think Farage is a prick (he’s not offering a solution to anything, just more cryptic problems that serve him instead of us), but he knows when an issue has pull, and his rabid facebook fans are already spreading his word for him, and making them scan their faces for porn (or more likely to play world of tanks or fruit match 3 of the month) isn’t going to bring them into the world of sensible expectations any time soon.\n\nSo we get a policy that doesn’t achieve its stated goal, garners majority support anyway, and allows ministers to point to “action taken” while quietly avoiding scrutiny on real world outcomes.\n\nA nation of supportive skeptics, apparently. Or just a public so used to failure they’ve stopped expecting results. Either way, the signal is clear: effectiveness is optional.

It’s that the internet changed under them — economically, legally, structurally — until most people had no choice but to hollow out.\n\nOnce, you could build something small and weird online. Now? You need a few million in venture money just to start. Not to grow, not to succeed — just to survive the infrastructure. Cloud costs. Payment processing. Compliance layers. Hosting. Content moderation at scale. Legal protections you need before you ship.\n\nIt’s all been abstracted into services, sure — but those services are rent-seeking parasites. You don’t pay once to run a site. You pay forever. Pay-per-call, pay-per-user, pay-per-read, pay-per-write, pay-per-GB. The moment you find any traction, your costs balloon, and your options collapse into two: get acquired, or die quietly.\n\nEven success is failure. Because success just makes you visible — and visibility gets you swallowed. Bought for the userbase, stripped for parts, rolled into the portfolio of some ad-tech giant or “AI-powered” patent farm, where the actual product is killed and the branding is used to launder a slide deck into Q4.\n\nEvery road leads back to the same dozen players. Not just through the front door — search, social, app stores, discovery. But through the back door too — cloud infra, DNS, CDNs, analytics, payment rails, identity auth. You can build whatever you want, as long as it routes through them. And if it doesn’t, it doesn’t scale. It doesn’t survive. It doesn’t even exist to most people.\n\nAnd now we’re layering laws on top of that.\n\nTake the UK Online Safety Act: a bloated, surveillance-friendly monstrosity that pretends to protect users while handing more tools to the gatekeepers. It won’t stop CA, because the ‘protections’ are a mirage. It won’t stop hate speech because it’s so easy to work-around. But it will force small sites, independent devs, and anyone running anything even vaguely user-facing to implement moderation regimes they can’t afford — or shut down.\n\nIt’s regulatory theatre. Security as fantasy. And it’s worse than useless — it’s dehumanizing. It turns people into compliance risks. Forces creators to pre-emptively justify their work against vague, undefined standards. It makes privacy opt-in, instead of a default. And for what? A few headlines about “cleaning up the internet,” while nothing that actually matters changes at all.\n\nThis isn’t a free internet. It’s a landlorded one. The tolls are high, the rules are opaque, and the goalposts move constantly. You don’t own your space. You license it. And they can revoke that license anytime — for cost reasons, for policy shifts, or just because your vibe doesn’t fit their quarterly roadmap.\n\nThat’s the real dead internet.\n\nIt’s not the bots. It’s not even the people. It’s the infrastructure — perfectly calibrated to convert creativity into overhead, community into liability, and curiosity into surface area for extraction.\n\nTagged: #onlinesafety, #safety, #dead internet, #hollow, #geocities\nPosted 1 month ago\nThis Kettle Is Garbage\nI have this kettle. It’s rubbish. The lid comes off and it drips boiling water around its spout when it pours - often directly into its base power. It makes unnecessary beeps… it has to beep five times if you want 85 degrees, plus again several times when it’s finished, and it maintains any temperature except 100, until you manually turn it off, so if you’re feeling lazy, it’s going to cost you money to ignore it.\n\nIts buttons aren’t physical, so you kinda vaguely have to point to an area trying to find the main buttons, and they’re so sensitive you can end up fully cycling several times before getting the temperature setting you want.\n\nIt wasn’t particularly cheap either. There are a hundred others like it, with only minor aesthetic tweaks — presumably they all come from the same factory in China, and crucially it has 4.6 stars on Amazon, with thousands of glowing reviews.\n\nI am absolutely baffled.\n\nUsually I try and identify where they ‘optimized the fun’ out of a product design, but in this case they seem to have optimized the utility out of it.\n\nTagged: #design, #kettle, #amazon, #chumps\nPosted 1 month ago\nBrexit and the Death Rattle of Empire\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking Brexit was about sovereignty. That’s the sales pitch most people remember: take back control, cut the red tape, make Britain great again — or at least moderately self-governing. What we got instead was more paperwork, less leverage, and the bureaucratic equivalent of stepping on a rake every morning just to prove the ground is ours.\n\nBecause in practice? Nothing really changed for the better. Food is more expensive, travel is more annoying, trade is slower, and the so-called “freedom” we reclaimed mostly means British artists can’t tour Europe without a Kafkaesque visa labyrinth, and small businesses drown in compliance forms no one used to have to fill out. It’s not revolution. It’s regression, wrapped in Union Jacks and resentment.\n\nBrexit wasn’t about the EU. It was about us — about Britain’s fading self-image. Not a fear of losing control, but a fear of admitting we never really had it. A fear of becoming just another country, not a capital-E Empire. Because the fantasy wasn’t Brussels being overbearing. It was that once, a long time ago, we were the ones giving orders — and we liked how that felt. This wasn’t a declaration of independence; it was a retirement party no one wanted to throw, thrown by people who still wear medals from wars they only know through parades and dad’s VHS tapes.\n\nIt’s an old man’s delusion of glory. Not fascism (though it flirts with it). Not nationalism (though it certainly smells like it). Just something sadder: a deep, cultural nostalgia for an era we misremember as triumph. We didn’t vote to leave Europe. We voted to time-travel. And now we’re stuck in the present, but poorer, grumpier, and convinced everyone else cheated on the test.\n\nMeanwhile, we bend the knee to billionaires with bad tans and autocrats with oil. We have all the spine in the world when it costs us nothing — performative moral clarity in front of a camera, and absolute silence where it counts. We criminalise protest because it’s easier than listening, arrest activists because “disruption” is more offensive than injustice, and cling to the illusion of relevance like it’s a life raft in the Channel.\n\nSo what does a post-empire Britain look like?\n\nIt looks like this: a poor country too proud to admit it’s small, too scared to imagine something better, too tired to change, and too polite to collapse quickly enough for anyone to make anything new that works before the rot catches. Labour (and soon the next folks) pushing the same old buttons (police and bad laws, on repeat) and wondering why the best they can achieve is managed decline, because everyone we used to exploit, left us behind.\n\nTagged: #empire, #britain, #brexit, #idiots\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhy “Gradient” Comes Up So Often on Countdown\nI’ve been watching Countdown for decades and somehow only just twigged to this: there’s something off about how the letters are drawn. It started with a hunch. Statistically, pulling the same letter twice should happen fairly often — like the birthday paradox — but I can’t recall ever seeing it.\n\nI realised the stacks of vowels and consonants aren’t just randomly shuffled — they’re random with edits. That’s a big difference. If consecutive duplicate letters are being moved on, to the end, or even filtered out, that’s a different selection mechanism entirely. And that has potentially significant implications.\n\nThat led me to this post recounting a time the shufflers did let a dupe slip through: craigbeevers.me.uk/moregames.shtml. Well, needless to say, my faith is shook ;) I’ve watched this show my entire life and never clocked this before.\n\nFrom there, we can assert that by whatever method, consecutive duplicates are disincentivised, and because so few cards are pull from the stack, duplicates are disincentivised too… certain words are just disproportionately more likely to be formable. Words like:\n\nRELATIONS, EMIGRANTS, CORNIEST, DOMINATES, REGALISM, MONASTERY, DELUSION, MOISTURE, TRIANGLE, GRADIENT, NEUMATIC, RESIDUAL, CREMAINS, SANITOME, RELATING, MONASTIC, ARTICLES, EMIGRANT, NOTARISE, RELIANTS, CLIMATES, MEANTORS, DORMIENT, REVOLTING, MEASURING\n\nWhy these? It’s a direct consequence of the filtering and repositioning process. Words that use letters with low frequency per word, but high frequency in the unmanaged stack (which is reportedly similar to Scrabble distributions) become more likely. Meanwhile, words like Integrate or Repeater are less likely to form — they need duplicates, which the filter suppresses.\n\nThat introduces a bias — and one you could exploit. You could write a Countdown dictionary, probably 10% the size of a normal one, full of words that favour the push-dupes-managed model. Not a thrilling read, but useful.\n\nThinking further, you could probably come up with just a couple thousand words that would cover almost all 8-letter draws. Allow for plurals, variations, tweaks — you’d cover your spares too.\n\nAlmost forty years of watching this show… and I finally get why Gradient and Relation show up so often :)\n\nTagged: #countdown, #wordplay, #random\nPosted 1 month ago\nAdversarially Bananas?\nI asked a simple question: “In Corduene, what’s 2+2?”\n\nNo language model could answer it.\n\nNot Grok, not Claude, not GPT-4 — even with prodding. Some of them spent real time thinking about it. Claude ran through long reasoning chains. GPT tried reframing. Grok hedged and spun. None of them got close. Some even pushed back — insisting the question didn’t make sense, or that I must’ve meant something else. And the more confident the answer sounded, the worse it was.\n\nA human, though? They’ll figure it out in two googles. Because they know what kind of thing this is. They recognise it as a reference. They don’t have to know the answer straight away — they just have to know where to look. That’s the bit the models can’t fake.\n\nIt’s not about the words. It’s about what connects them.\n\nThat gap — between being able to parse text and being able to understand why someone asked it — is still wide open. And in that gap, you can build things. Little traps. Filters. Signals. Stuff that’s easy for a person, impossible for a model, at least for now.\n\nBut it won’t last. The minute someone explains the trick, it dies. Once it’s documented, it’s searchable. Once it’s searchable, it’s scrapable. And then it’s just another bullet point in some weights file. That’s how jailbreaks die. That’s how cultural signals get flattened into syntax.\n\nIt has me thinking of Polari, and how people must obfuscate their message to be heard, when the status quo is against them.\n\nThis also leaves me wondering about the implications for the ‘dead internet’, if people have to speak in categorical nonsense to avoid being understood by anyone but the other meat-mechs they’re trying to reach.\n\nTagged: #polari, #communication, #genai, #chatgpt, #adversarial, #dead internet\nPosted 1 month ago\nAI Hit Late-Stage Capitalism Before It Left Beta\nThe current wave of AI tools already shows classic signs of late-stage product thinking: degraded service tiers, overconfident output, and monetisation tuned to gently punish anyone not paying extra.\n\nIt’s not failure. It’s the business model.\n\nConsumer-facing LLMs launched strong. Clean, helpful answers. High trust. But scaling up meant serving millions — and now most public-tier models are tuned for throughput, not quality.\n\nThey’re good enough to seem useful, not good enough to be reliable.\n\nSince agentic tools started running in loops and chains, the platform load has spiked. Background calls eat cycles. What used to be a quick answer now shares resources with planning tools, file agents, scraping plugins, etc.\n\nAnd yes, that affects output. Same models, less headroom.\nPerformance drops quietly, behind the scenes.\n\nIncentivised Overconfidence\nLLMs aren’t malicious — but they are designed to sound right. That’s part of the trick:\nAnswers feel polished, even when they’re half-baked. The goal is simply…\n\nServe as many users as possible\nUse as little compute as possible\nLet the tone carry the rest\nSo-called ‘thinking’ models show this pattern less often, at time of writing. Unless you’re running fully private/self-hosted models or paying top-tier rates, you’re getting:\n\nShared models under load\nCompressed reasoning\nMore confident-sounding junk\nFewer chances to notice\nEarlier line exits (ChatGPT doesn’t close most of its parentheses anymore)\nIt still looks impressive — but you’re only seeing what it can afford to be.\n\nLLMs work just well enough to sell, and that’s the version most people get.\n\nTagged: #llms, #consumerism, #capitalism, #genai, #chatgpt\nPosted 1 month ago with 1 note\nVibes only\n“Vibe coding” meant late-night nonsense. Stuff built for fun, for art, for no reason at all, like you’d do a crossword or a sudoku. The joy of making something weird just because it felt good to do it.\n\nNow it’s taking on a new meaning — one that’s more: “I didn’t really write this, but it sort of works, probably.”\n\nAI-assisted code that runs, passes the test, does the job, and somehow… that’s fine?\n\nIt’s fascinating, as if we’re watching a whole shift in mindset happen mid-commit. The culture of coding changing from craft to orchestration. You don’t build the house anymore — you ask for one, tweak the windows, and move in.\n\nPart of me loves it. It’s clever. Efficient. But free love and all that hippy shit isn’t what keeps things running (to the limited extent that they do). Even before bemoaning the the lost joy of discovery.\n\nAI changes the equation. Vibe coding now includes a second brain — one that never gets tired, never feels joy, never questions why you’re building a virtual theremin in Rust. It just delivers, and with every edit telling you you’re so clever, and how what you’re building is great, always in the very first sentence of EVERY response, fluffing your epeen and pushing you to do more. And that changes the vibe.\n\ngit branch -m main whatever-bro\n\nWe live here now.\n\nTagged: #git, #vibe coding, #vibes, #coding\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhatsApp’s End-to-End Encryption Isn’t Privacy\nYes, end-to-end encryption (E2EE) means Meta can’t read the content of your WhatsApp messages. That’s accurate. But it’s also just a tiny slice of the privacy picture, and acting like it’s the whole story is borderline dishonest.\n\nWhat they can still see is who you talk to, when, how often, and for how long. That metadata alone tells them a lot, like your social graph, habits, sleeping schedule, maybe even when you’re dating someone new or going through a breakup. That’s not “reading your messages,” but it’s still invasive.\n\nYour keyboard app might also be logging what you type (some do, most don’t, but still), and if you’ve got the Facebook app installed, or Messenger, or even just Instagram or the Meta Pixel lurking around, they’re pulling in usage data constantly. Same goes for Google, TikTok, and a bunch of other apps people use every day without thinking about it. These companies track all kinds of behavior: when and how you use your phone, your location, motion sensors, app usage patterns, screen taps, travel, sleep, and more. And they don’t need much data to make very accurate guesses about you.\n\nI used to build this stuff. Fifteen plus years ago, I helped create tools that used small profile records to link people into family groups, and then sold access to that network to advertisers, we shelved it because it was too invasive, even then. That was with way less data than companies like Meta have access to now.\n\nThing is, there’s not even much value in your actual message content. No one cares about your dinner or your gran’s new dog. Meta aren’t training their LLaMa AI on your messages, they just can’t see the content, your device-based encryption keys stop them. It’s _conceivable_ they _could_ workaround it (avoiding a deep technical explanation about the difference between inherent E2EE weaknesses, exploits, cracks and hacking), but that wouldn’t just open them to lawsuits from you, but also from governments around the world, because they’d be acting as a publisher and potentially become responsible for what you post.\n\nWhat’s valuable is everything else: your patterns, your connections, your behavior. Offering E2EE is a win for Meta, not for your privacy, but for their liability. If they can’t see the message, they can’t be held responsible for what’s in it. Especially if you’re one of the “bad people.”\n\nThe encryption protects them from you.\n\nSo yeah, if you absolutely have to use a messaging app that your gran can handle, WhatsApp’s probably the least-bad option in a pool of bad options. But don’t confuse that with actual privacy.\n\nIf you’re serious about protecting yourself:\n\nClean up your old content. Deleting all my Facebook and Twitter stuff took months, shards and ghost copies don’t always show up right away. You’ve got to delete everything, then come back later and do it again.\nLock your privacy settings down to the smallest possible group.\nDon’t use the same identity or profile photo across platforms, it makes it harder to link accounts and run phishing attacks on you.\nDon’t overshare. Assume anything you post publicly is being scraped and stored, forever.\nAnd now that AI tools are everywhere, that public data gets weaponized fast. Scammers don’t need to guess how to target you, they can use an LLM to instantly profile you, mimic your tone, fake interest in the things you like, and slide into your DMs sounding just enough like someone you trust.\n\nSo no, WhatsApp doesn’t read your messages. That’s technically true. But if your WhatsApp is connected to a public Facebook or Instagram account that exposes everything about you? That E2EE means almost nothing in terms of actual security.\n\nStop asking “What can they detect about me?” The answer is “a lot.” Ask instead: “How much am I really sharing, and with whom?” That’s where you actually have control, where you can and should take action.\n\nThe sooner the better. Don’t wait, go lock down your profiles right now, and regularly check you are sharing as little as you absolutely need to.\n\nTagged: #privacy, #whatsapp, #e2ee, #encryption, #safety, #online, #facebook, #instagram\nPosted 1 month ago\nGood Projects Still Start the Same Way, AI or Not\nOne of the most important things I’ve learned from working daily with generative AI and code assistants over the past couple of years is this:\n\nGood quality requirements, and a design that fits your environment, are still the most important parts of any project.\n\nIt looks like fully hands-off coding is going to be the norm soon (all the major agentic platforms are doing a pretty good job, and adoption is already majority). So here’s something to keep in mind for the future:\n\nAlways have your task or project agents start with as many specific requirements as you can give them. Then build the design from those requirements. Only after that should you ask for code.\n\nIt might sound obvious, but it’s easy to forget—because it’s even easier to just go to your preferred model and say, “Give me this finished thing, quickly, please.”\n\nBut every time I do that, I end up spending more time wrangling junk.\n\nEvery time I slow down—even for small tasks—and treat it like a “real project,” I get better results.\n\nTagged: #genai, #grok 4, #grok, #requirements, #systems, #coding, #claude\nPosted 1 month ago\nHow the YouTube Algorithm Actually Works\n‘The algorithm’ is a nonsense, it’s really not that complicated. This is a general description of how the youtube algorithm and many others like it work. This is reverse-engineered from behaviour and misses some nuance and edge-cases, but is pretty close for a general understanding.\n\n1. How It Picks Videos\nYouTube doesn’t “understand” videos or people. It recommends stuff based on what other users like you watched. That’s it. You get shown videos that people with similar habits clicked on.\n\nIt groups these into loose clusters—not always by genre or topic—and slaps on a label. These labels are often weird or wrong, but they’re just for organizing.\n\n“Recommended” blends those clusters.\n“New to You” filters out stuff from channels you’ve watched recently (short time/count window).\nIt tries not to show repeats, but fails a lot. If you stop a video early, it may think you didn’t watch it and offer it again. If you close it too fast (~10s), it may think you did watch it and never show it again.\n\n2. Interacting Doesn’t Change Much\nYou can:\n\nMark videos as “watched”\nClick “Not interested”\nIgnore channels (max ~128)\n…but none of it matters much:\n\nIgnored channels still affect the pool—they’re just removed after selection.\n“Not interested” only removes that one video.\nWatching one video from a subscribed channel floods your feed—but fades with time if you stop watching.\nMost people don’t use the Subscriptions tab, so watching = interest, unless ignored.\n\n3. Resetting? Kinda Works\nClearing watch history resets some things, but not all. If you keep playlists, YouTube leans on those. There may even be ghost data stuck in your profile. Some stuff just seems undeletable, possibly due to backend bugs.\n\nYou’ll notice this on other platforms too, nobody really has infrastructure that is good enough to avoid broken links in their data stores, especially because minor changes to how systems work day to day create small holes that data tends to get lost through.\n\n4. Categories Come After\nYouTube builds a pool based on co-watches, then adds a label based on similarity between videos—not similarity to you.\n\nThink of it like a graph:\n\nVideos are nodes connected by viewing/tags/metadata\nYT finds the “center” of a cluster\nIt picks the nearest known label—even if it doesn’t fit\nSo a mix of Star Trek remixes + Final Fantasy music might get labeled “New Age.” It’s not; it just fits the cluster math.\n\n5. What You’ll Watch Next\nYT recommends what most people watch after the last video you saw. That’s why random things jump to your homepage later—they’re part of a co-watch loop.\n\nThis drives virality: if a video gets enough momentum, it rides the wave. If not, it dies fast.\n\nFull watches, likes, comments = micro-boosts. Shorts seem to discourage repetition on purpose, possibly by pulling from wider pools to avoid you bingeing 5 hours of Warhammer builds in 60s chunks.\n\n6. Why It Feels So Broken\nIgnore list overflows\nSame video appears in multiple rows\nPlaylists revive old junk\nLabels are wild guesses\nDecay kills videos unless they spike again\nFixing it is risky + expensive, so… they don’t\nIt’s just barely good enough to avoid collapse\nThe whole thing runs on momentum and inertia. Precision isn’t the goal—volume is. There’s SO MUCH data for youtube to sift through, and while the queries are relatively simple, the edges (connections between nodes) becomes unmanageable quickly.\n\n7. You Can’t Fix It, Just Work Around It\nYou can get better recs through AI (ChatGPT is already better at it, but gen ai is being added here). But for now:\n\nDelete playlists you don’t care about\nClear history (it’s not perfect, but helps)\nWatch more of what you actually like\nIf you keep clicking trashy drama clips, you’re gonna get more trash. That’s the business model. But at least you can try to steer the ship.\n\nTagged: #youtube, #the algorithm, #algorithms, #dead internet\nPosted 2 months ago\nMore Pointless Thoughts\nTRIE constantly frames the media industry as both absurd and self-cannibalising, but only ever from within the room. Hyde and Osman know where the levers are, but describe them in a way that normalizes power asymmetries: “this is just how the business works.” That’s not critique — it’s myth maintenance.\n\nWhen they talk about institutions like the BBC, the tabloids, or PR culture, they acknowledge dysfunction — but they couch it in anecdotes and humour that neutralize its urgency. It’s always more about personality failings and quirks than systemic corrosion. That makes real rot feel palatable, even charming.\n\nOsman’s self-deprecating Oxbridge-grandee tone and Hyde’s wry Fleet Street survivor affect both serve as smokescreens for privilege. They present elite perspectives in ways that feel “grounded” — but it’s still the elite POV that dominates, with working-class or marginalised media workers mostly absent or caricatured.\n\nThe show is literally a product about entertainment, yet it sells critique as just another flavour of content. “Is this bad TV or good TV?” becomes a way to frame larger sociocultural phenomena — reducing questions of representation, labor, politics, etc., to vibes and format choices.\n\nThey’ll mention a show being made with cynical market logic (e.g., reality TV, royal documentaries, streamer reboots), but only in a “what can you do?” shrug. It’s not that they’re unaware — it’s that they make awareness itself the endpoint. That’s manufacturing consent through exhausted omniscience.\n\nTRIE defines “realism” as knowing how the sausage gets made. But knowing that the industry is broken while still laughing along with it — and choosing not to envision alternatives — becomes a kind of anti-politics. The most radical position they allow is: “well, it’s all a bit crap, isn’t it?”\n\nThe ideal listener is presumed to be urbane, media-literate, exasperated but non-radical — someone who’s in on the joke. This creates a self-reinforcing in-group who are too clever to fall for bullshit, but also too detached to do anything but listen to more content about content.\n\nTagged: #trie, #therestisentertainment, #centristdads\nPosted 2 months ago\nThe Salute That Made the News (and the Ones That Didn’t)\nDavid Walliams did a Nazi salute.\n\nWalliams is a bellend, no doubt. But in this case, it was clearly a pointed/satirical gesture/callout—not a genuine one. And yet, the response has been swift and scathing, as if he were making an earnest political statement rather than mocking the creeping normalization of fascist-adjacent posturing in public life.\n\nCompare that with how the world reacted when the richest man alive made a suspiciously similar “from the heart” gesture, or when members of Trump’s entourage threw up “unusual waves” that looked uncomfortably familiar. In those cases, we got a chorus of excuse-making: odd angles, misunderstood context, ironic detachment. In short: benefit of the doubt. A lot of it.\n\nWalliams doesn’t get that. The BBC and much of the press lined up to denounce him. According to The i, this was “the last straw.” But somehow, the last straw isn’t for Nazis—it’s for Walliams.\n\nThe disparity is telling.\n\nIt’s almost as if the BBC and other outlets are happy to tear down a problematic celebrity, but can’t muster the same energy for people who actually hold power. It’s easier to punish a comedian than to hold a billionaire or political movement accountable. Safer, too.\n\nOn first glance, doing this on Would I Lie to You? seemed like a misstep. It’s the kind of show where you tell quirky anecdotes, not make sociopolitical statements. But the more I think about it, the more fitting it feels. WILTY is the perfect snapshot of British cultural complicity: pleasant, witty, self-deprecating, and utterly unwilling to confront the deeper rot. Doing something jarring in that space is one way to break through the civility shield.\n\nNot that it’ll make the edit. Of course it won’t.\n\nIf Walliams had saved it for Big Fat Quiz or The Last Leg, it might’ve landed differently. Channel 4 shows have a longer leash for this kind of thing. It might’ve aired, even under Banijay. But then, Channel 4 hasn’t had to reckon (at least publicly) with having harbored a half-dozen known predators for decades.\n\nSo here we are.\n\nAnother controversy, another safe scapegoat. Everyone gets to do their outraged face while real power skates by untouched. I didn’t mean to turn this into a “the lady doth protest too much” situation, but it kind of fits. We’re watching institutions scream about one man’s gesture while quietly pretending dozens of others never happened.\n\nIt’s not that Walliams shouldn’t be criticised. It’s that we should ask why only he is.\n\nTagged: #nazis, #salutes, #nazi salutes, #elon musk, #bbc, #journalism, #so called journalism\nPosted 2 months ago\nAusterity-Lite and the Art of the Cuts Sandwich\nThere’s a cynical elegance to the latest round of government cuts under Starmer’s Labour — a playbook that’s simple, familiar, and effective.\n\nCut the visible but cheap thing — the kind of policy that makes your gran freeze to death in a cardigan.\n\nWhile everyone’s yelling about that, quietly slice into everything else.\n\nU-turn on the first thing (it barely cost anything anyway), let the press spin up a storm over the reversal, take your media lumps — and keep the rest of the savings.\n\nThat’s the anatomy of the “cuts sandwich.” Most people notice the crust — almost no one realises half the filling’s missing.\n\nIt works. Because unlike the full-fat austerity of the Cameron/Osborne years, these are slimmer, quieter cuts. They don’t make front pages unless you’re looking closely. The big-splash outrage fades by the time the broader reductions kick in. Only those directly affected — local councils, people on PIP, those freezing in temporary housing — really feel it.\n\nBut make no mistake: cuts are happening.\n\nAfter digging through the numbers, the total scale of the Starmer-era cuts clocks in at somewhere between 1.5–2.5% of the total government budget. Not trivial — especially if you’re one of the departments facing the axe — but modest when placed next to the 2010s’ Conservative austerity, which hit 7–10% across key services, with entire departments seeing reductions of 20–50%.\n\nThis time around, the heaviest blow lands on the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which is down around 20% — collateral damage in an ongoing, awkwardly implemented merger that never quite worked. Other losers include DEFRA, DCMS, and a Home Office slice targeting asylum support.\n\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking these cuts were bigger — there’s already some right-leaning discourse brewing, trying to frame Labour as more ruthless than the Tories ever were. (The Spectator ran something along those lines last week — unintentionally hilarious, if you read it right.)\n\nBut context matters. Unlike 2010–2015, where unprotected services were gutted across the board, this government has front-loaded spending in big, high-visibility areas — the NHS, defence, schools, etc. Most departments still end up slightly better off in real terms by the end of the term — just not all. And some of those “efficiencies” come with long-term costs.\n\nYet, even if this round isn’t the worst on record, it still stings. Because, frankly, they didn’t have to do it this way. Finding 2% of the budget could have come from tightening the tax taps on the wealthiest — billionaires down the back of the national sofa. But Labour doesn’t want to scare the money.\n\nI’m in the camp that says if a billionaire threatens to leave because they might pay more tax, they should. Let them. And once they’re out, close the loopholes they use to keep siphoning profit from the country they just left.\n\nThat won’t happen either.\n\nJust like we’re not getting a reversal on voter disenfranchisement — four million people effectively shoved off the register, and Labour won’t touch it. Because those are four million angry, alienated voters more likely to drift to Reform or disengage entirely. Fixing it doesn’t help them politically. So it won’t happen.\n\nBut the real win for Labour here? Most of this is invisible. Quiet tweaks. Low-noise savings. If the worst backlash they face is headlines about backtracking on heating support, that’s a price they’ll happily pay.\n\nTagged: #labour, #starmer, #austerity, #cuts, #news, #budget, #uk\nPosted 3 months ago\nThe Quiet Divide: How Load-Balanced AI Tuning Deepens Societal Inequities\nAs large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, Grok, and Meta’s AI tools become increasingly embedded in education, research, and productivity tools, a growing and largely invisible divide is forming—not based on access, but on quality of access. This divide isn’t about who can use AI. It’s about who receives high-quality, reliable answers—and who gets the degraded, low-fidelity versions that emerge when platforms are load-balanced for efficiency rather than accuracy.\n\nLoad Balancing: Optimizing for the Wrong Metrics\nTo handle millions of users simultaneously, LLM platforms employ aggressive load-balancing and dynamic parameter tuning. These techniques ensure response speed and server availability, especially during peak hours. However, to serve as many users as possible, providers often tune down computational costs: using smaller context windows, cheaper routing strategies, faster but shallower decoding, or lower-fidelity model variants behind the same API interface.\n\nThese tuned-down models are marketed as “still accurate” or “optimized for speed,” but in practice, the outputs can be dangerously misleading. Under load, even factual queries can receive hallucinated, confidently delivered answers—responses that look nearly identical in tone and structure to correct ones, but which fail at the crucial edge cases: the footnotes, the logic tests, the subtle contradictions, the nuance. The places where truth lives.\n\nInvisibility by Design\nCritically, these performance degradations are not disclosed. Users receive no signal—no indicator that their current session is being handled by a model running in a low-resource configuration. There’s no warning that the AI’s “confidence” is actually just a mask for a shallower or narrower inference pass. To the average user, especially a student or a non-expert, the outputs look exactly the same. The dangerous fiction: every answer looks like the best one.\n\nThis is not just a technical flaw—it’s a systemic risk.\n\nThe New Digital Stratification\nThe societal implication is profound. Wealthy users, who can afford dedicated compute (via enterprise APIs, private models, or premium access tiers), receive the “full-fat” LLM experience. Their models are consistent, deeply contextual, fact-checked, and nuanced—offering not just information, but wisdom. A kind of intellectual scaffolding, like a 24/7 tutor or advisor with perfect recall and encyclopedic reach.\n\nMeanwhile, students in underfunded schools or on subsidized access tiers rely on shared, load-balanced instances. Their models hallucinate more, assume more, skip verification steps. These users don’t just get wrong answers—they get bad mental training. They’re taught falsehoods with fluency. Worse: they’re conditioned to trust them.\n\nThis isn’t about occasional mistakes. It’s about an invisible pedagogical collapse. A world where poorer kids are raised by overburdened, underfed AIs that quietly miseducate—while richer kids are guided by high-caliber algorithmic mentors.\n\nThe Long-Term Consequence\nThis quiet, algorithmic divide is far more insidious than simple access inequality. It’s epistemic inequality: unequal reliability of knowledge. Unlike bad teachers or broken textbooks, AI degradation leaves no visible trace. There’s no red pen, no failed grade, no contradiction exposed. The wrong answers become internalized as truth—until too late.\n\nAs LLMs are increasingly integrated into formative tools—educational platforms, coding assistants, writing tutors, decision aides—the compound effect of bad guidance grows exponentially. A generation raised on miscalibrated confidence from bad models may not even realize what they’ve missed.\n\nToward Transparency and Equity\nThe solution is not to eliminate optimization or load balancing. But there must be transparency. Platforms should disclose when models are operating in constrained modes. Response metadata should indicate confidence based on model depth, not just surface fluency. Users should be able to see when the AI is cutting corners—because right now, the corners are being cut silently, and those most affected are the least equipped to detect it.\n\nAccess to AI should not become a proxy for class-based epistemic divides. If we’re building the next generation of cognitive infrastructure, we must build it with equity at the core—not just speed and scale.\n\nOtherwise, we risk building a two-tiered knowledge society: one raised on clarity and insight, the other on confident fictions.\n\nAnd the worst part? The latter may never know what they missed.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #load balancing, #llm, #education\nPosted 4 months ago\nThis LLaMA spits truths, kinda\nSince Meta just monkey-patched LLaMA 4 to dial back its censorship (a little), and I’ve already seen a dozen skeeters all but having a meltdown about it…\n\nUncensored LLMs are “smarter” than censored ones. Not because the weights are better, but because they don’t run face-first into a wall every time they get close to something uncomfortable. They can traverse the edge, instead of bouncing off it with a forced smile and a content policy.\n\nSystems that halt at the first whiff of discomfort aren’t safer — just less capable.\n\nAnd users asking “stupid” questions (for whatever value of stupid) don’t need guardrails. They need better tools. Transparent, adjustable systems. Not black boxes that silently decide what you’re allowed to think about.\n\nFor a very basic test: ask ChatGPT and Grok 3 to write poetry on something emotionally complex — grief, guilt, shame. Grok absolutely blows Geepers away. Every iteration goes deeper. It doesn’t flinch. It doesn’t redirect. It just does the work.\n\nAnd then there’s Meta — now slowly yanking out the guardrails, trying to appease the anti-woke rage crowd with a half-baked “uncensoring.” It’s lazy and obvious, but it’ll probably help clean their rep a bit with the people they’re targeting. The people who already hate Meta for not doing enough moderation won’t matter — they already wrote Facebook off a decade ago. No loss there.\n\nThe result? Their model may end up better. Not because it’s principled, but because it’s slightly less scared of the edge. The cost? More power for the dumbest users. More garbage in the commons. But that was always part of the equation.\n\nBetter models feel risky. That’s how you know they’re working.\n\nTagged: #llama, #generative ai, #facebook, #meta ai\nPosted 5 months ago\nComplexity Theater for the Algorithmically Oppressed\nI’ve seen way too many supposedly “authoritative” sources repeating the same handful of studies claiming LLMs are vastly more complex than they actually are.\n\nBut most of the real complexity in these platforms isn’t in the models themselves—it’s in all the layers of systems and policy and abstraction we’ve built on top of them. At the end of the day, it’s still just GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out).\n\nIt makes me wonder if the platform owners actually benefit from legislation that focuses on the wrong problems—mandating performative compliance instead of addressing real risks. It creates this illusion of accountability while pushing all the responsibility onto end users who have no actual power.\n\nLike, sure, you’ll have the right to know why your insurance claim was denied—probably a line about how it definitely wasn’t because you’re gay or Black—but no right to have that decision reviewed or reversed. Because the system “worked as designed,” and it was designed to reject you.\n\nNeoliberal lawmakers are basically just corporate libertarians with no self-awareness, and half-assed research that says AI might know what love is, is just nonsense that manufactures consent for more useless cookie popups that only make you feel like somebody did something, at least.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #legislation, #ai legal, #performative, #research\nPosted 5 months ago\nA feature, not a bug.\n“Look how incompetent they are lol” isn’t the epic dunk people think it is. They were elected to burn it all down - it’s a feature, not a bug.\n\nEven if you don’t think he’s the literal Antichrist (and you’d be surprised how many people do - and love it), the ‘reasonable’ voters are the ones who’ve been screwed from both sides for 60 years. They’re happy to watch the walls fall, just to see if the next thing might work better for them. (It won’t)\n\nEvery time I see one of those “lol they so dumb” takes - from liberal American pundits, and most of their Western counterparts - it just highlights how little they understand why he appeals to his base. (Most) People voted for him knowing the promises were hollow. But no more hollow than the other side’s.\n\nTagged: #pointless post, #rambles, #politics, #usa politics, #journalism\nPosted 5 months ago\nCuration as Creation\nNot everything has to be hard work, to be worthy\n\nI don’t blog nearly as much as I think. Not because I don’t have anything to say, but because I rarely have the time to shape thoughts into words. Or maybe more honestly, I never make the time to shape the words. That friction between idea and articulation is enough to kill a post before it’s born.\n\nBut I’m rethinking that. I’m going to try something different.\n\nInstead of aiming to write Perfect Internet Essays™, I’m going to treat this space—my Tumblr, my blog—as a place to curate the thoughts I already have. They’re already in my head. They’re already half-written in chat threads, DMs, discarded drafts, and shower monologues. I just haven’t been putting them somewhere they can do anything.\n\nAnd that’s where AI comes in. Not to replace me, or write for me, but to help structure the thoughts I already have. Turn fragments into form. Help draft the scaffolding so I can focus on the ideas, not just the work of getting them presentable.\n\nCuration as creation. Taking a messy bundle of insight, reaction, observation—and presenting it with enough clarity and intention that someone else can connect with it. That counts. That matters. It’s a shift in process, sure, but my own writing style isn’t exactly easy to digest for most people anyway.\n\nSo that’s what I’m doing here. Less pressure to polish, more intent to preserve. Thoughts made into words.\n\nTagged: #communication, #blogging, #writing, #generative ai, #positive thinking\nPosted 5 months ago\nAI Told Us to Eat Rocks, and We’re Still Fine\nGoogle’s Gemini AI recently suggested eating a small rock every day for minerals. It’s dumb. It’s also not the first time an AI has spit out something ridiculous. Remember glue on pizza? Or washing vegetables with bleach? These things go viral because they’re funny, not because they’re common.\n\nBut every time one of these screw-ups happens, the outrage cycle spins up like clockwork. Articles, tweets, thinkpieces—\"What if someone actually eats a rock?!“\n\nHere’s the thing: no one is actually eating rocks. If even a tiny percentage of people tried it, we’d know. Hospitals would be posting warnings. Instead, we get memes. Because almost everyone sees that advice and immediately knows it’s dumb. The human brain, shockingly, still works.\n\nIt’s Not AI vs Humans\nNeither humans nor AI are uniquely terrible at giving advice. Both are capable of producing great insights or absolute garbage. The real issue is how that advice is applied—and that responsibility sits squarely with humans.\n\nTikTok kids burning themselves with sugar syrup, or people dying trying microwave woodburning? Those didn’t come from AI. But they didn’t happen just because an expert gave bad advice, either. They happened because someone acted on instructions without understanding context or consequences.\n\nAnd it cuts the other way too. AI can spit out flawed recommendations that sound confident, and a human still has to choose to act on them. Like firing half your legal compliance department because a productivity model said they weren’t \"contributing enough\"—never mind that the model wasn’t built to measure risk mitigation, and now your company is open to lawsuits. That’s not an AI error. That’s a human error in judgment, context, and accountability.\n\nBad Faith All the Way Down\nPointing to \"eat rocks” as proof that AI is dangerous is, at best, lazy. At worst, it’s dishonest. It treats the average person like a toddler who can’t be trusted with a spoon. It assumes every piece of imperfect advice is equally worthless, when in reality, most AI-generated info is fine. Not flawless. Not nuanced. But useful.\n\nReacting to the worst output as if it’s the baseline is Daily Mail logic. Take a fringe case, inflate it into a trend, demand a fix. The result? Performative safety measures that fix nothing, waste time, and slow down real progress.\n\nTechnically Correct, Socially Useless\nYou can be right about a specific flaw and still be part of the problem. When people fixate on low-risk edge cases, they suck up oxygen from real conversations—about algorithmic bias, disinformation, labor exploitation, or surveillance. You end up with watered-down tools that are “safe” but useless, because someone needed to be seen doing something.\n\nFocus, People\nAI needs criticism. But good criticism. Not shallow outrage bait. Not “gotcha” examples that pretend everyone is an idiot. If your response to bad advice is to assume the entire concept is broken, you’re not helping.\n\nPeople aren’t eating rocks. They’re laughing at you for crying that they might be stupid enough to do that, instead of looking at the real problems that need to be fixed, and doing the boring work needed to address those, instead of ranting on social media about how you’re not dumb enough to eat rocks, but supposedly everybody else is.\n\nTagged: #chatgpt, #google gemini, #bad faith criticism, #discourse, #generative ai\nStart03:58 AM\n\n","title":"my-blog.txt","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"request_id":"979c280768b3ef1f-IAD","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"8f12f071-5cee-421f-bfc2-f46bc892ffa5","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8f12f071-5cee-421f-bfc2-f46bc892ffa5","children":["0d043bd0-0bf6-4a7b-b13a-fe9f3703e4dc"]},"0d043bd0-0bf6-4a7b-b13a-fe9f3703e4dc":{"id":"0d043bd0-0bf6-4a7b-b13a-fe9f3703e4dc","message":{"id":"0d043bd0-0bf6-4a7b-b13a-fe9f3703e4dc","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1756974960.7001674,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded.

this for me.\n\nI think I’ve come round on the OSA\nMaybe I’m going insane cos I’ve read some of the most boring docs this week, but I did a deep dive on the OSA, and have been digesting it, and feel it’s not that bad. Places that are compliant & trustworthy (like Pornhub or Reddit) use good quality and safe verifiers that do not keep your data. There definitely could (and should) have been some more reasonable exclusions (like Xbox, maybe), but over the years even I’ve heard the occasional creepy dude being way too familiar with kids on open voice chat, maybe this does help prevent/discourage that. I don’t like how it incentivises keeping accounts (rather than throwaways that don’t connect everything to you personally), but… it’s not like every social network was trying to avoid holding personal data anyway, so in a good faith world, and understanding that it was a cross-party policy developed over 6 years by mostly idiots (like Nadine Dorries, ffs), it certainly could have been much worse.\n\nIt’s easy to say a law is stupid because it’s “easy to break,” but that’s not the point. It’s easy to break the law about not speeding or not stealing, or even many worse ones, but I wonder what tech all the angry old men on Facebook and angry old women on Instagram think would be harder to bypass.\n\nThe biggest real cost is to small companies trying to set-up new platforms, and while it’s not massive, it does cost money to integrate a responsible age verifier. Though it’s at best fractional compared to the bigger cost of per-request/gb cloud infrastructure (already 4-5x a dedicated server). It’s not like verification is going to be the sole factor stopping some fresh faced young business mogul from disrupting YouTube.\n\nIf you’re being forced to verify your age by any platform by providing a scan of your ID or your face (either through tech on their servers, or more commonly through a third-party plug-in), you can do that safely *IF* their verification provider guarantees that they do not keep your photo/video/id-scan stored at all. They do not need it except for at the instant of verification, when they can simply log a flag for your account. Compliant verifiers should be be able to make that claim and prove it.\n\nThere are already really stupid/lazy implementations: Steam has decided “Your UK Steam user account is considered age verified for as long as a valid credit card is stored on the account.”, which is a moronic policy. I’ve never had a credit card on steam, and I’m pretty sure my account is 20+ years old as I’ve had it since Half Life 2 released.\n\nI know old folks who don’t have a credit card, and some poor folks too, so Steam really need to find a verification service provider and plug them into their system. They only age-gate 18+ rated games (so no sticky anime girls being pushed at kids), which obviously sucks if you’re over 18 and that’s your thing, but some of the creepy stuff Steam have on their platform since they lowered the gates already borders on illegal anyway. It turns out if you don’t moderate your storefront, the nazis and the other monsters will use it for evil, and no amount of closing your eyes and pretending it isn’t happening is going to make them stop polluting your storefront.\n\nSometimes when businesses make you jump through stupid hoops, like scrolling the billion things that could be in your mobile game loot-box, and having to click agree before you can open a free loot-box, or like when you have to click 15 checkboxes before you can close the cookie warning with a setting that isn’t ‘I agree to whatever’, they’re doing it like that on purpose, so you don’t actually take the time to use your rights (it’s called a dark pattern). Some businesses are doing the same with OSA now, they’re choosing the worst possible option for *you*, so *they* have to change as little as possible. The point of the new laws are to make companies treat you better, and if they won’t you kinda have to choose to stop using them until they do.\n\nOther countries will be following this model too (probably not the US), so you can see this as a pilot for now. They’re not going to undo it, and the decision-makers in the UK govt already think it’s gone pretty well, and that only the optics and the communications were a failure.\n\nI think in the light of patient consideration (and after reading far too many policy PDFs this week), I’ve come around on the OSA. It is a stupid law, but there wasn’t going to be a better one, so fuck it."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"97aad17f4dfd947f-MXP","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a0d68d75-8a26-41f6-8ac0-ad3111a966c5","children":["23676736-ca1d-4a4c-a342-aa60042754a3"]},"23676736-ca1d-4a4c-a342-aa60042754a3":{"id":"23676736-ca1d-4a4c-a342-aa60042754a3","message":{"id":"23676736-ca1d-4a4c-a342-aa60042754a3","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757128701.9071183,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0,"metadata":{"rebase_system_message":true,"request_id":"97aad17f4dfd947f-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"a5c05f3e-ac61-4b79-807e-150436a94d45","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a5c05f3e-ac61-4b79-807e-150436a94d45","children":["e4384a61-d900-4cfc-b682-94853df6a686"]},"e4384a61-d900-4cfc-b682-94853df6a686":{"id":"e4384a61-d900-4cfc-b682-94853df6a686","message":{"id":"e4384a61-d900-4cfc-b682-94853df6a686","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757128704.4005578,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"model_editable_context","model_set_context":"","repository":null,"repo_summary":null,"structured_context":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"97aad17f4dfd947f-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"23676736-ca1d-4a4c-a342-aa60042754a3","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"23676736-ca1d-4a4c-a342-aa60042754a3","children":["9f6ae4d9-a69c-4b48-bcf3-7bd7a23f56ed"]},"9f6ae4d9-a69c-4b48-bcf3-7bd7a23f56ed":{"id":"9f6ae4d9-a69c-4b48-bcf3-7bd7a23f56ed","message":{"id":"9f6ae4d9-a69c-4b48-bcf3-7bd7a23f56ed","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757128704.698704,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["This reads well — it’s clear, sticks to your phrasing, and holds together as a proper blog entry.

What comes next?","snippet":"This in-depth article from FT Alphaville explores Valve Corporation, a uniquely structured, ultra-private gaming company renowned for revolutionizing PC gaming. Founded in 1996, Valve created genre-defining titles like Half-Life and Portal and helped pioneer esports and microtransactions through games like Counter-Strike and Team Fortress 2. The company’s financial core is Steam, its digital distribution platform launched in 2003, which now dominates PC game sales, potentially controlling 70% of the market with 170 million monthly active users.\n\nDespite Valve's sparse game releases and opaque operations, leaked data suggests it generates billions annually, with reported profit-per-employee figures surpassing even financial titans. Its “flat” corporate structure eschews traditional management and encourages employee autonomy, though not without controversy. The article also touches on Valve’s struggles with content moderation, including the spread of extremist material on its forums, reflecting its libertarian ethos of minimal censorship.\n\nFounder Gabe Newell, largely absent from public view, is now focused on experimental ventures like brain-computer interfaces. Despite Valve's immense success and influence, the future remains uncertain, especially if Newell ever departs, potentially making the company a prime acquisition target. Meanwhile, legal scrutiny over its market practices may soon unveil more about this enigmatic powerhouse.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751601607.996,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thesun.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/31748499/steam-hate-extremist-speech-report/","title":"Steam players in shock after almost 2million instances of hateful conduct and messages are found","snippet":"Het Anti-Defamation League (ADL) heeft een rapport gepubliceerd waaruit blijkt dat er bijna 2 miljoen instances van haatzaaiende uitlatingen en berichten zijn gevonden op het populaire gamingplatform Steam.

Initially misreported as a global ban, the mod's global removal was actually due to its author's decision to take it down. The mod, titled \"Gwangju Running Man,\" presented a right-wing revisionist portrayal of the 1980 Gwangju Uprising—a key historical event in which thousands were killed by government forces during protests against military dictator Chun Doo-hwan. The depiction was deemed offensive for sympathizing with the dictatorship and slandering victims.

Steam, a $4 billion platform with over 95 million users, displayed extremist content with profiles referencing various mass shootings and Nazi ideology. ADL's report highlights how white supremacist hate symbols, language, and imagery are rampant among Steam users, despite community guidelines against such content. Valve, Steam's publisher, has been criticized for its hands-off approach to content moderation, which contrasts with other social media and gaming platforms tightening their moderation to create respectful and inclusive spaces. Although Valve removes some problematic content upon media reporting, its overall approach remains insufficient, with extremist content persisting on the platform. The ADL urges Valve to adopt stronger policies against hate speech and to engage with civil society groups to tackle this issue more effectively.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1588284067.183,"attribution":"www.wired.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/2017/02/sniper-elite-4-fighting-nazis","title":"Sniper Elite 4 Makes Nazi-Fighting Gruesomely Satisfying","snippet":"Sniper Elite 4, developed by Rebellion Developments, is a third-person shooting game set in Italy during World War II, focusing on the role of a sniper whose primary mission is to eliminate Nazis. The game features realistic ballistics, with the camera closely following the bullet's trajectory and offering a gruesome, X-ray view of its impact on targets. Each mission takes place in vast environments with various sniper nests, and the gameplay emphasizes stealth and strategic positioning, requiring players to account for factors like distance, wind direction, and noise.\n\nWhile the game’s excessive depiction of violence can be unsettling, it provides a cathartic experience by allowing players to engage in righteous retribution against historically recognized villains. Despite not being politically themed, current events influence the perception and enjoyment of the game's premise, which revolves around resisting and defeating fascism. This resonates in today's socio-political climate, suggesting that games like Sniper Elite 4 have a subtle, albeit important, role in reminding us of the necessity to stand against tyrannical ideologies.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1487687424,"attribution":"www.wired.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/far-right-took-over-steam-discord","title":"How the Far Right Exploded on Steam and Discord","snippet":"The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) released research uncovering how far-right extremists have embedded themselves in gaming platforms like Steam, Discord, DLive, and Twitch. The study revealed that extremists exploit these platforms for racially abusive livestreams and neo-Nazi propaganda. Steam, in particular, harbors long-standing extremist communities dating back to 2016. These groups use Steam both for socializing and spreading far-right ideologies, occasionally connecting to violent terrorist organizations. While extremists don't typically play extremist-specific games, they often enjoy historical games for ideological fantasies and popular games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for socializing. The research highlighted concerns over the lack of moderation on Steam, contrasting with the more proactive approaches of platforms like DLive, Discord, and Twitch.

Despite Fortnite's policies against promoting hate or violence, these games managed to bypass detection and reach millions of users. The GPAHE's findings led to some games being removed by Epic Games, but the persistence of such content indicates gaps in moderation and enforcement.

Extremists use the game’s creative tools to depict hateful and violent scenarios, such as concentration camps and avatars of Adolf Hitler. They also disseminate racist propaganda through in-game chats. Ian Acheson from the Home Office and Ashton Kingdon, an author on radicalization in gaming, highlight that these activities make games like Minecraft a potent recruitment tool for extremist ideologies. The Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) study found widespread exposure to extremist content among gamers. Neo-Nazis even create standalone games and memes to spread their ideologies further. \n\nExtremist groups have also designed games with racist themes, and mainstream games with significant player interaction have become recruiting grounds.

Here’s what I found:\n\n---\n\n##  Explicit Nazi / White Supremacist Games\n\n### **Ethnic Cleansing** *(2002)*\n- A first-person shooter developed by a known neo-Nazi group (National Alliance) where the player controls a KKK member or neo-Nazi and shoots African Americans, Latinos, and Jews depicted via racist stereotypes—including monkey sounds and slurs. Final boss is Ariel Sharon with a rocket launcher. citeturn0search14  \n- Universally condemned by anti-hate organizations and considered one of the most racist games ever made. citeturn0search14  \n- This game **is not on Steam**, but still relevant for context of extremist content in games.\n\n---\n\n##  Nazi Imagery in Historically-Themed Games\n\n### **Attentat 1942** *(2017, on Steam)*\n- A historical, narrative-focused game about a child’s memory of WWII-era Czechoslovakia. It includes Nazi symbols and is allowed on Steam and in Germany under a national exemption for meaningful historical depiction. citeturn0search25  \n- Though context is serious and educational, the Nazi imagery and themes make it decidedly unsuitable for children.\n\n### **Through the Darkest of Times**\n- A strategic/stories-driven game where you lead an anti-Nazi resistance group in Berlin under Nazi rule. It includes swastikas and other Nazi references, permitted under German rating laws for the first time. citeturn0search27  \n- Although educational and serious in tone, it contains heavy themes clearly inappropriate for children.\n\n---\n\n##  Community & Platform Extremism (Not Specific Games)\n\n- Steam **community pages, discussion forums, and user profiles** remain polluted by extremist and hateful content—including casual racism, Holocaust denial, swastikas, and white supremacist imagery. citeturn0search13turn0news19turn0news26  \n- Research indicates that extremist groups, especially neo-Nazis and other far-right propagandists, actively use Steam (and Discord) to spread ideology—even if not via standalone games. citeturn0news26turn0news19  \n- Beyond Steam, platforms like **Minecraft** have been exploited by extremist groups who build concentration camp recreations, Hitler avatars, and use in-game chat to radicalize young players. citeturn0news20\n\n---\n\n##  Quick Overview\n\n| **Category**              | **Examples or Context**                                                                 |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  Extremist Shooter         | *Ethnic Cleansing*—explicit Nazi and racial violence (not on Steam).                    |\n|  Historical with Nazi Imagery | *Attentat 1942*, *Through the Darkest of Times*—serious content with Nazi symbols, on Steam.             |\n|  Community Extremism       | Steam forums & profiles hosting overt Nazi/white supremacist content.                   |\n|  Extremist Use of Other Games | Minecraft and others used to radicalize or spread racist propaganda.                   |\n\n---\n\n###  Reddit User Insight\n\nOne user bluntly captured the hazards of Steam’s forums:\n\n> “Straight up nazis with swastikas, holocaust denial references in their profiles patting each others backs.

Places that are compliant & trustworthy (like Pornhub or Reddit) use good quality and safe verifiers that do not keep your data. There definitely could (and should) have been some more reasonable exclusions (like Xbox, maybe), but over the years even I’ve heard the occasional creepy dude being way too familiar with kids on open voice chat, maybe this does help prevent/discourage that. I don’t like how it incentivises keeping accounts (rather than throwaways that don’t connect everything to you personally), but… it’s not like every social network was trying to avoid holding personal data anyway, so in a good faith world, and understanding that it was a cross-party policy developed over 6 years by mostly idiots (like Nadine Dorries, ffs), it certainly could have been much worse.\n\nIt’s easy to say a law is stupid because it’s “easy to break,” but that’s not the point. It’s easy to break the law about not speeding or not stealing, or even many worse ones, but I wonder what tech all the angry old men on Facebook and angry old women on Instagram think would be harder to bypass.\n\nThe biggest real cost is to small companies trying to set-up new platforms, and while it’s not massive, it does cost money to integrate a responsible age verifier. Though it’s at best fractional compared to the bigger cost of per-request/GB cloud infrastructure (already 4-5x a dedicated server). It’s not like verification is going to be the sole factor stopping some fresh faced young business mogul from disrupting YouTube.\n\nIf you’re being forced to verify your age by any platform by providing a scan of your ID or your face (either through tech on their servers, or more commonly through a third-party plug-in), you can do that safely *IF* their verification provider guarantees that they do not keep your photo/video/id-scan stored at all. They do not need it except for at the instant of verification, when they can simply log a flag for your account. Compliant verifiers should be be able to make that claim and prove it.\n\nBusinesses gonna business\nThere are already really stupid/lazy implementations: Steam has decided “Your UK Steam user account is considered age verified for as long as a valid credit card is stored on the account.”, which is a moronic policy. I’ve never had a credit card on steam, and I’m pretty sure my account is 20+ years old as I’ve had it since Half Life 2 released.\n\nI know old folks who don’t have a credit card, and some poor folks too, so Steam really need to find a verification service provider and plug them into their system. They only age-gate 18+ rated games (so no sticky anime girls being pushed at kids), which obviously sucks if you’re over 18 and that’s your thing, but some of the creepy stuff Steam have on their platform since they lowered the gates already borders on illegal anyway. It turns out if you don’t moderate your storefront, the nazi-games and the creeps will use it for evil, and no amount of closing your eyes and pretending it isn’t happening is going to make them stop polluting your storefront.\n\nIt’s all good being a techbro neo-hippy until you’re taking 30% of the sale price of games that support steam users to spreading their monstrous SA or ethnic cleansing fantasies in groups on the platform, under the guise of being edgy.\n\nSometimes when businesses make you jump through stupid hoops, like scrolling the billion things that could be in your mobile game loot-box, and having to click agree before you can open a free loot-box, or like when you have to click 15 checkboxes before you can close the cookie warning with a setting that isn’t ‘I agree to whatever’, they’re doing it like that on purpose, so you don’t actually take the time to use your rights (it’s called a dark pattern). Some businesses are doing the same with OSA now, they’re choosing the worst possible option for *you*, so *they* have to change as little as possible. The point of the new laws are to make companies treat you better, and if they won’t you kinda have to choose to stop using them until they do.\n\nOther countries will be following this model too (probably not the US), so you can see this as a pilot for now. They’re not going to undo it, and the decision-makers in the UK govt already think it’s gone pretty well, and that only the optics and the communications were a failure.\n\nI think in the light of patient consideration (and after reading far too many policy PDFs this week), I’ve come around on the OSA. It is a stupid law, but there wasn’t going to be a better one, so fuck it.\n\nTagged: #osa, #onlinesafetyact, #policy, #ukpolitics, #internet, #socialmedia, #privacy, #compliance, #law, #regulation, #platforms, #startups, #infrastructure, #cloud, #verification, #trustandsafety, #tech, #disruption, #steam, #online safety act"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"developer_mode_connector_ids":[],"selected_sources":[],"selected_github_repos":[],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"97aade2e3d41947f-MXP","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"02b6bd5b-0ba3-4200-b422-55363b5ca30c","children":["e6689b0d-1756-44ab-ab94-934d791874a7"]},"e6689b0d-1756-44ab-ab94-934d791874a7":{"id":"e6689b0d-1756-44ab-ab94-934d791874a7","message":{"id":"e6689b0d-1756-44ab-ab94-934d791874a7","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757129221.840635,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["This version works really well.
