# B) What changes you actually see (user‑visible)

<details>
<summary><strong>Why am I hitting age walls now?</strong></summary>
Two reasons: (1) services used by or likely to be accessed by children must show “highly effective” age assurance around adult or harmful categories; (2) Ofcom’s timelines kicked in through 2025, so platforms shipped changes together. The law expects services to evidence their choices, not guess.

<summary><strong>Do I need to upload my passport everywhere?</strong></summary>
No. Services can choose among several methods. Better implementations offer privacy‑preserving options first (for example, facial <em>age estimation</em> that doesn’t identify you), then fall back to stronger checks (photo‑ID + liveness, bank‑sourced “over 18”, mobile‑network checks) if confidence is low. Good flows delete images after the check and only keep an “age OK” token.

<summary><strong>Why does Reddit ask for a selfie but Steam wants a card?</strong></summary>
Different risk choices. Reddit uses a verifier offering selfie age estimation or ID as a fallback, which can be both quick and privacy‑respecting when deletion is enforced. Steam’s UK policy marks you “verified” if a valid credit card is on file—simple, but weaker against misuse (parent card) and exclusionary for people without credit cards. The regulator treats card checks as acceptable only when they meaningfully bind to the actual user.

<summary><strong>Can I avoid checks with a VPN? Is that safer?</strong></summary>
You can route around some gates, but a shady VPN may see a lot more of your traffic than a certified verifier sees of your face/ID (which should be deleted on the spot). If you choose a VPN, understand the trade‑off: you’re swapping a one‑time, certifiable check for continuous exposure to a network you don’t control.

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I don’t have a smartphone or I fail a face check?</strong></summary>
Services should provide alternatives: ID+live via webcam, bank‑sourced age attribute, mobile‑network check, PASS (digital proof of age), or email‑based estimation where appropriate. If estimation fails because of lighting or camera quality, you should be able to retry or switch methods without losing access unfairly.

<summary><strong>What will I notice beyond age checks?</strong></summary>
- Clearer reporting and complaints routes in apps.
- Safer defaults for teen accounts (limited recommendations, tighter contact settings).
- More consistent takedowns of clearly illegal content (terrorism, child sexual abuse material, fraud, revenge porn).
- For adults: optional filters to reduce exposure to abusive or otherwise legal‑but‑unwanted content.
