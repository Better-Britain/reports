<summary><strong>Why did age verification become the story?</strong></summary>
It’s visible and deadline‑driven: ordinary adults meet it at point‑of‑use. The harder work (risk assessments, safer defaults, audits) happens out of sight. Media and creators naturally amplify what people can feel right now (see Ofcom’s phased [roadmap](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/roadmap-to-regulation)).

<summary><strong>Manufactured disconsent: why gamer spaces ignite</strong></summary>
Frustration with clumsy implementations is real. Some actors redirect that into rejecting governance itself (“all rules are tyranny”). Gaming communities have long had the tools for fast mobilisation (raids, brigades, review‑bombs). That makes them fertile ground for turning “bad design choice” into “law is illegitimate.” Our sourced notes trace this pattern through earlier cycles (e.g., Gamergate coordination) and show how platform choices can fuel it.

<summary><strong>What should platforms do to avoid backlash?</strong></summary>
Design for privacy first (deletion, non‑ID options), give a choice of methods, explain plainly, and provide fast appeals. Don’t shift the burden onto users. People will still grumble, but the temperature drops when the friction feels respectful and optional (mirroring Ofcom’s outcomes‑not‑one‑tool approach in the [children’s codes](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/statement-protecting-children-from-harms-online)).

<summary><strong>Follow‑up: why do some companies over‑comply?</strong></summary>
Incentives: legal uncertainty, fear of large fines, and tight timelines push legal teams toward blunt, audit‑friendly choices. A single gate (e.g., “card on file”) is easier to evidence than nuanced, targeted design. But it’s also more exclusionary and angers users—ironically fuelling the backlash. Ofcom’s approach leaves room for layered, privacy‑preserving methods; companies should use that room.
