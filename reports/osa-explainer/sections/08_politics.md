# Politics & perception

Policy meets people through headlines and hot takes. Age checks are the visible tip, so they soak up the attention; the quieter plumbing barely gets a mention. This section helps separate outrage at clumsy rollouts from bigger questions about how we want platforms—and rules—to work.

<summary><strong>Why did age verification become the story?</strong></summary>
It’s visible and deadline‑driven: ordinary adults meet it at point‑of‑use. The harder work (risk assessments, safer defaults, audits) happens out of sight. Media and creators naturally amplify what people can feel right now (see Ofcom’s phased [roadmap](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/roadmap-to-regulation)).

Coverage through mid‑2025 and beyond focused on Reddit’s selfie‑based rollout and Steam’s credit‑card approach, which sparked strong reactions across gaming and creator spaces. See, for instance, the BBC on Reddit’s UK rollout ([BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4ep1znk4zo)) and developer press on Steam’s card‑on‑file design ([Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/you-now-need-a-credit-card-to-access-mature-content-on-steam-in-the-uk)).

- What people see: age checks at login or when opening adult areas.
- What they don’t see: risk assessments, safer defaults for teens, audits and reporting.
- Why it spreads: media and creators focus on visible changes that affect everyday use.
- Examples shaping the narrative: Reddit’s selfie+ID fallback; Steam’s card‑on‑file design.

<summary><strong>Manufactured disconsent: why gamer spaces ignite</strong></summary>
Frustration with clumsy implementations is real. Some actors redirect that into rejecting governance itself (“all rules are tyranny”). Gaming communities have long had the tools for fast mobilisation (raids, brigades, review‑bombs). That makes them fertile ground for turning “bad design choice” into “law is illegitimate.” Our sourced notes trace this pattern through earlier cycles (e.g., Gamergate coordination) and show how platform choices can fuel it.

Polling in 2025 suggests broad support for protecting kids alongside scepticism about effectiveness. For example, a July 2025 YouGov poll reported high support for age verification but doubts about outcomes, and an August 2025 Ipsos study found many Britons back checks while questioning how well they work. Linking to such polls helps explain why public sentiment can be pro‑safety yet critical of clunky designs. ([YouGov poll results](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/society/survey-results/daily/2025/07/24/8b234/3), [Ipsos—Adults and age checks](https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/britons-back-online-safety-acts-age-checks-are-sceptical-effectiveness-and-unwilling-share-id)).

- Real friction: blunt designs (e.g., card‑only gates) annoy people and exclude some users.
- Amplification: organised groups can turn design anger into “the law is the problem.”
- Fast spread: gaming spaces are built for mobilisation (raids, brigades, review‑bombs).
- Public mood: support for protecting kids sits alongside doubts about real‑world results (YouGov; Ipsos).

<summary><strong>What should platforms do to avoid backlash?</strong></summary>
Design for privacy first (deletion, non‑ID options), give a choice of methods, explain plainly, and provide fast appeals. Don’t shift the burden onto users. People will still grumble, but the temperature drops when the friction feels respectful and optional (mirroring Ofcom’s outcomes‑not‑one‑tool approach in the [children’s codes](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/statement-protecting-children-from-harms-online)).

- Lead with privacy: delete images; avoid ID when not necessary.
- Offer routes: face, ID+live, bank, PASS—let users pick.
- Explain in‑product: simple language; no mystery steps.
- Fix mistakes quickly: retries and appeals that actually work.

<summary><strong>Follow‑up: why do some companies over‑comply?</strong></summary>
Incentives: legal uncertainty, fear of large fines, and tight timelines push legal teams toward blunt, audit‑friendly choices. A single gate (e.g., “card on file”) is easier to evidence than nuanced, targeted design. But it’s also more exclusionary and angers users—ironically fuelling the backlash. Ofcom’s approach leaves room for layered, privacy‑preserving methods; companies should use that room.

- Uncertainty + big penalties → “easy to prove” designs.
- Single, blunt gates are simple to audit but frustrate users and exclude some people.
- Better path: layered, privacy‑preserving methods that still pass audits.
- Regulator stance: Ofcom’s framework allows layered methods—use that space.
