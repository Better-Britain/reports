<summary><strong>Why did age verification become the story?</strong></summary>
It’s visible and deadline‑driven: ordinary adults meet it at point‑of‑use. The harder work (risk assessments, safer defaults, audits) happens out of sight. Media and creators naturally amplify what people can feel right now.

<summary><strong>Manufactured disconsent: why gamer spaces ignite</strong></summary>
Frustration with clumsy implementations is real. Some actors redirect that into rejecting governance itself (“all rules are tyranny”). Gaming communities have long had the tools for fast mobilisation (raids, brigades, review‑bombs). That makes them fertile ground for turning “bad design choice” into “law is illegitimate.”

<summary><strong>What should platforms do to avoid backlash?</strong></summary>
Design for privacy first (deletion, non‑ID options), give a choice of methods, explain plainly, and provide fast appeals. Don’t shift the burden onto users. People will still grumble, but the temperature drops when the friction feels respectful and optional.
