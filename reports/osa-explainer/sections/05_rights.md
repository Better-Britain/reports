# E) Your rights & routes

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens to my photo/ID? Can I make them delete it?</strong></summary>
Certified providers should delete images immediately after the check and keep only what’s needed (e.g., an “18+ OK” token tied to your account). Under UK data protection law (UK GDPR), you have rights to access, correction, and erasure where applicable. If a provider claims deletion, they should be able to show it.

<summary><strong>How do I complain about a bad implementation?</strong></summary>
First use the platform’s complaints route (required by the OSA). If you’re ignored or the design is unfair (e.g., only credit‑card verification), escalate to the regulator. Ofcom’s portal accepts complaints; we recommend Ofcom adopt a simpler, user‑first intake that aggregates patterns so individuals don’t have to write long dossiers.

<summary><strong>What if I don’t want to share ID at all?</strong></summary>
Ask for a non‑ID route: facial age estimation (with deletion), open banking (bank confirms “over 18”), mobile‑network checks, or a PASS digital proof of age. Services should let you pick from more than one method.

<summary><strong>Do small/federated communities have to do all this?</strong></summary>
Duties scale. Many small servers won’t hit the heavy thresholds. Still, publish a clear safety policy, run a basic risk assessment, and use low‑friction tools where needed (e.g., email estimation or PASS). Federated admins remain providers in law, but expectations are proportionate to size and risk.
