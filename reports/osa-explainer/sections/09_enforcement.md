# I) Enforcement reality & what to watch next

<details>
<summary><strong>What will Ofcom actually do in 2025–26?</strong></summary>
- Require risk assessments (illegal content; children’s risks) and review them.
- Audit systems and request data where needed.
- Issue guidance/codes and check designs match the risks claimed.
- Use penalties when providers won’t fix issues (fines up to 10% global revenue; in rare cases, blocking orders).

See Ofcom’s phased [roadmap](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/roadmap-to-regulation) and the government’s [OSA explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer).

<details>
<summary><strong>How does a case usually progress?</strong></summary>
Informal engagement → information notices/audits → improvement steps → penalties if refusal or repeated failure. Most cases end with fixes, not fines, but credible penalties focus minds.

<details>
<summary><strong>Early wins vs misfires to track</strong></summary>
- Wins: faster removal of clearly illegal material; safer teen defaults; multiple age‑assurance routes shipped by large platforms.
- Misfires: one‑route gates (e.g., credit‑card only), poor appeals, slow deletion practices, or policies that shift the burden onto users.

<details>
<summary><strong>What might change under this government?</strong></summary>
Strategic priorities (e.g., safety‑by‑design, violence against women and girls) will shape Ofcom’s focus. Expect more consultations and iterative codes—so feedback from users and smaller providers matters.

<summary><strong>Follow‑up: how can users/SMEs prepare?</strong></summary>
- <strong>Users</strong>: keep screenshots and links when a design is unfair; use platform appeals first; escalate to Ofcom for systemic issues; use ICO if the issue is data handling/retention.
- <strong>SMEs</strong>: document a short risk assessment; pick proportionate age‑assurance options (offer a non‑ID route); publish a plain‑English safety page and appeals; keep deletion/tokenisation minimal. See Ofcom’s [online safety hub](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety).
