# I) Enforcement reality & what to watch next

Rules only matter if they change what services do. Enforcement is the unglamorous engine: audits, questions, fixes—and fines when needed. It won’t make the internet perfect, but it can push platforms toward safer, clearer designs. Here’s what action looks like in practice and how to track progress.

<details>
<summary><strong>What will Ofcom actually do in 2025–26?</strong></summary>
- Require risk assessments (illegal content; children’s risks) and review them.
- Audit systems and request data where needed.
- Issue guidance/codes and check designs match the risks claimed.
- Use penalties when providers won’t fix issues (fines up to 10% global revenue; in rare cases, blocking orders).

See Ofcom’s phased [roadmap](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/roadmap-to-regulation) and the government’s [OSA explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer).

<summary><strong>What are the penalty caps and disruption tools, exactly?</strong></summary>
Ofcom can fine up to <strong>£18m or 10% of qualifying worldwide revenue</strong> (whichever is greater) and, in severe cases, seek <strong>court‑ordered business disruption</strong> measures (e.g., payment/ads withdrawal or ISP access restrictions). See Ofcom’s enforcement guidance and the government explainer: [Ofcom—Enforcement guidance (PDF)](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/illegal-harms/online-safety-enforcement-guidance.pdf?v=391925), [gov.uk OSA explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer).

<details>
<summary><strong>How does a case usually progress?</strong></summary>
Informal engagement → information notices/audits → improvement steps → penalties if refusal or repeated failure. Most cases end with fixes, not fines, but credible penalties focus minds.

<details>
<summary><strong>Early wins vs misfires to track</strong></summary>
- Wins: faster removal of clearly illegal material; safer teen defaults; multiple age‑assurance routes shipped by large platforms.
- Misfires: one‑route gates (e.g., credit‑card only), poor appeals, slow deletion practices, or policies that shift the burden onto users.

Ofcom provides periodic bulletins and statements tracking progress—use these as primary sources when citing trends and outcomes (see Ofcom’s [online safety industry bulletins](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/online-safety-industry-bulletins/online-safety-industry-bulletin-september-2025)).

<details>
<summary><strong>What might change under this government?</strong></summary>
Strategic priorities (e.g., safety‑by‑design, violence against women and girls) will shape Ofcom’s focus. Expect more consultations and iterative codes—so feedback from users and smaller providers matters.

<summary><strong>Follow‑up: how can users/SMEs prepare?</strong></summary>
- <strong>Users</strong>: keep screenshots and links when a design is unfair; use platform appeals first; escalate to Ofcom for systemic issues; use ICO if the issue is data handling/retention.
- <strong>SMEs</strong>: document a short risk assessment; pick proportionate age‑assurance options (offer a non‑ID route); publish a plain‑English safety page and appeals; keep deletion/tokenisation minimal. See Ofcom’s [online safety hub](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety).
