# I) Enforcement reality & what to watch next

<details>
<summary><strong>What will Ofcom actually do in 2025–26?</strong></summary>
- Require risk assessments (illegal content; children’s risks) and review them.
- Audit systems and request data where needed.
- Issue guidance/codes and check designs match the risks claimed.
- Use penalties when providers won’t fix issues (fines up to 10% global revenue; in rare cases, blocking orders).

<details>
<summary><strong>How does a case usually progress?</strong></summary>
Informal engagement → information notices/audits → improvement steps → penalties if refusal or repeated failure. Most cases end with fixes, not fines, but credible penalties focus minds.

<summary><strong>Early wins vs misfires to track</strong></summary>
- Wins: faster removal of clearly illegal material; safer teen defaults; multiple age‑assurance routes shipped by large platforms.
- Misfires: one‑route gates (e.g., credit‑card only), poor appeals, slow deletion practices, or policies that shift the burden onto users.

<details>
<summary><strong>What might change under this government?</strong></summary>
Strategic priorities (e.g., safety‑by‑design, violence against women and girls) will shape Ofcom’s focus. Expect more consultations and iterative codes—so feedback from users and smaller providers matters.

<details>
<summary><strong>Watchlist (living)</strong></summary>
- Platform method changes (who adopts privacy‑preserving routes vs blunt gates).
- Transparency reports that actually show outcomes, not just volumes.
- Appeals/complaints data: do users get fixes without jumping through hoops?
- Bias/fairness updates from independent testing, plus practical fallbacks.
