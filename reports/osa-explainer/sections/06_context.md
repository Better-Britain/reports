# Context: cookie law → GDPR → OSA

We’ve tried “make the user click more buttons.” It didn’t fix much. GDPR moved some of the work backstage, where it belongs. The Online Safety Act keeps pushing in that direction: less banner theatre, more responsibility on the people who design the systems we use every day.

<summary><strong>Why did cookie law feel rubbish?</strong></summary>
It pushed the burden onto users: endless banners and dark patterns to click through, while many sites kept tracking. It delivered lots of friction and little systemic change.

Context: the UK’s “cookie law” obligations came via PECR (Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations) implementing the EU ePrivacy Directive (early 2010s) alongside consent guidance; over time many sites implemented maximally annoying prompts rather than reducing tracking.

<summary><strong>What did GDPR improve?</strong></summary>
It forced more backend changes (lawfulness, purpose limits, data‑minimisation), gave regulators sharper teeth (fines), and created user rights (access/erasure). Still imperfect, but harder to “banner‑wash” away.

Timing: the EU’s GDPR applied from May 25, 2018, and the UK retained it as “UK GDPR” after Brexit. GDPR pushed controllers to redesign data flows, document decisions (DPIAs), and justify retention—shifting effort from user clicks to service systems.

<summary><strong>Where should OSA land?</strong></summary>
Squarely on <em>business systems</em>. The goal is not to make you click more pop‑ups, but to make services run safer designs: better defaults for kids, real reporting and appeals, and age checks that don’t hoard data.

That’s why Ofcom’s codes are method‑agnostic but outcome‑focused (robustness, reliability, fairness), and why the law empowers auditing rather than “make every adult show ID” edicts (see [gov.uk OSA explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer) and Ofcom’s [children’s codes](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/statement-protecting-children-from-harms-online)).

<summary><strong>How does this compare internationally?</strong></summary>
The EU’s <strong>Digital Services Act (DSA)</strong> pushes platforms to assess and mitigate risks, adds data access for vetted researchers, and strengthens transparency (fully enforced across 2024). The US debate around the <strong>Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)</strong> emphasises design duties and age‑assurance but faces constitutional challenges and a patchwork of state approaches.

The direction is similar: less banner friction, more systemic obligations. The UK’s OSA is part of that shift—child safety and illegal harms up front, transparency and audits on the back end.

<summary><strong>Offline analogies?</strong></summary>
Seatbelts, food hygiene, workplace safety: rules target the people who design and operate the systems, not the end user who has the least control.

That framing helps: you shouldn’t have to do all the work to be safe online. The obligations sit primarily with the services.

<summary><strong>Practical takeaway</strong></summary>
If a platform makes you jump through hoops, that’s usually an implementation choice. Ask for privacy‑preserving options (deletion, non‑ID routes). The law doesn’t require making your life harder; it requires the service to take responsibility .
