# F) Context: cookie law → GDPR → OSA

<details>
<summary><strong>Why did cookie law feel rubbish?</strong></summary>
It pushed the burden onto users: endless banners and dark patterns to click through, while many sites kept tracking. It delivered lots of friction and little systemic change.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What did GDPR improve?</strong></summary>
It forced more backend changes (lawfulness, purpose limits, data‑minimisation), gave regulators sharper teeth (fines), and created user rights (access/erasure). Still imperfect, but harder to “banner‑wash” away.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where should OSA land?</strong></summary>
Squarely on <em>business systems</em>. The goal is not to make you click more pop‑ups, but to make services run safer designs: better defaults for kids, real reporting and appeals, and age checks that don’t hoard data.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Offline analogies?</strong></summary>
Seatbelts, food hygiene, workplace safety: rules target the people who design and operate the systems, not the end user who has the least control.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Practical takeaway</strong></summary>
If a platform makes you jump through hoops, that’s usually an implementation choice. Ask for privacy‑preserving options (deletion, non‑ID routes). The law doesn’t require making your life harder; it requires the service to take responsibility.
