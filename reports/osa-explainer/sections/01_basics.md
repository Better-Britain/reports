# A) Basics & origin

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the Online Safety Act (OSA)?</strong></summary>
A UK law that puts duties on online services (not on users) to reduce illegal harms and protect children. Separate parts of the law create or update offences for individuals (e.g., cyberflashing), but the core of the OSA is about what <em>services</em> must do.

In practice, the OSA sets out who is in scope, requires risk assessments and safety systems, and empowers Ofcom to enforce compliance. See the primary Act for the full structure and definitions: <em>Online Safety Act 2023</em> on legislation.gov.uk. ([legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50))

<summary><strong>Who created it and who pushed it over the line?</strong></summary>
The policy started as the UK’s <em>Online Harms</em> programme (2019), the Bill was introduced to Parliament in March 2022, the Act received Royal Assent on 26 October 2023, and the current government accelerated delivery from mid‑2024.

- <strong>Origins (2019)</strong>: The UK Government published the <em>Online Harms White Paper</em> in April 2019 under then‑Prime Minister Theresa May, proposing a duty of care and a regulator to oversee online safety. ([gov.uk—White Paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper))
- [TODO: What happened here?]
- <strong>Introduction to Parliament (2022)</strong>: Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries introduced the <em>Online Safety Bill</em> to the Commons in March 2022. ([gov.uk—Press/Parliamentary materials](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-bill))
- <strong>Royal Assent (2023)</strong>: The Bill became the <em>Online Safety Act 2023</em> on 26 October 2023. ([legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/contents))
- <strong>Acceleration (2024→)</strong>: From July 2024, the government prioritised fast implementation via Ofcom’s phased codes and guidance rather than reopening the statute. Ofcom is the regulator responsible for writing codes, auditing, and enforcement. ([Ofcom—Roadmap to regulation](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/roadmap-to-regulation))

<details>
<summary><strong>Why did Labour keep/accelerate it after 2024?</strong></summary>
It was already law, public support for child protection is high, Ofcom’s roadmap was running, and ministers can shape delivery through strategic priorities and secondary measures rather than re‑legislate.

The government’s own explainer emphasises platform duties and phased commencement, which made delivery the pragmatic path. In May 2025 ministers also issued strategic priorities to guide Ofcom’s approach. See: the official <em>Online Safety Act explainer</em> ([gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer)) and Ofcom’s online safety hub/roadmap ([Ofcom](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/roadmap-to-regulation)).

<summary><strong>What services are in scope?</strong></summary>
<strong>User‑to‑user services</strong> and <strong>search services</strong> with a UK link. Duties scale with size, functionality and risk.

- <strong>User‑to‑user services</strong>: services where content a user generates, uploads or shares can be <em>encountered by other users</em>. This can include public posts and features like group chats/DMs where content is shared beyond a single user. See the definition in Part 2, <strong>s.3</strong>. ([legislation—s.3](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/section/3))
- <strong>Search services</strong>: services that search multiple websites/databases and present results. Part 2, <strong>s.4</strong>. ([legislation—s.4](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/section/4))
- <strong>UK link</strong>: a service is in scope if it has a link with the UK (e.g., UK users or targeting). Part 2, <strong>s.5</strong>. ([legislation—s.5](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/section/5)) [TODO: Lacks detail, expand on what constitutes UK links]

For a plain‑English overview, see the government explainer (which also notes private messaging can be in scope where content is shared): ([gov.uk—OSA explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer)).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is <em>out</em> of scope?</strong></summary>
Certain service types and limited‑functionality features are exempt (e.g., standard email/SMS; one‑to‑one live audio/video calls; internal business services). [TODO any more exclusions specified?]

See <strong>Schedule 1</strong> and <strong>Schedule 2</strong> of the Act for the detailed exemption lists and conditions. Examples include one‑to‑one live a/v communications and basic email/SMS. ([legislation—Schedule 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/schedule/1), [legislation—Schedule 2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/schedule/2))

<details>
<summary><strong>What the OSA <em>doesn’t</em> do</strong></summary>
- It doesn’t impose a general “ID for everyone.” The law is risk‑based and method‑agnostic; self‑declaration doesn’t count, but several privacy‑preserving methods do. ([Ofcom—Protecting children online (codes)](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/statement-protecting-children-from-harms-online))
- It doesn’t ban end‑to‑end encryption (E2EE). Powers exist but only “if technically feasible,” and the government has stated they won’t be used until that bar is met. ([gov.uk—OSA explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer))
- It doesn’t create blanket bans on legal speech for adults. Instead, services must apply their own terms consistently and offer tools/appeals. ([gov.uk—OSA explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer))
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What the OSA <em>does</em> require from services</strong></summary>
- <strong>Assess risks</strong> (illegal content; and for kids, content likely to harm) and keep assessments up to date. (Part 3 duties; Ofcom guidance and templates in its online safety hub.) ([Ofcom—hub](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety))
- <strong>Design and operate systems</strong> that reduce those risks (moderation, reporting, user controls, safer defaults for children). ([Ofcom—codes](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/statement-protecting-children-from-harms-online))
- <strong>Use “highly effective” age assurance</strong> where needed (several methods are acceptable; self‑declaration is not). ([Ofcom—codes](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/statement-protecting-children-from-harms-online))
- <strong>Be transparent</strong> (clear terms, complaints/appeals) and cooperate with Ofcom audits and information requests. (Part 7 powers; see Ofcom roadmap.) ([Ofcom—roadmap](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/roadmap-to-regulation))
- <strong>Face penalties</strong> if they won’t fix issues: Ofcom can fine up to <strong>10% of qualifying worldwide revenue</strong> and, in rare cases, seek business‑disruption (blocking) measures. ([gov.uk—OSA explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer))

- <strong>Mar 2025</strong>: Illegal‑harms duties begin to bite; Ofcom starts enforcing. ([Ofcom—industry bulletin / roadmap](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/roadmap-to-regulation))
- <strong>Jul 2025</strong>: Children’s codes and age‑assurance expectations go live for services likely to be accessed by children; porn sites must gate access. ([gov.uk—OSA explainer](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer))
- <strong>Through 2026</strong>: Phased codes, audits, transparency reporting and reviews continue. ([Ofcom—online safety hub](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety))
