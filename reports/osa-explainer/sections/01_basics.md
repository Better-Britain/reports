# A) Basics & origin

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the Online Safety Act (OSA)?</strong></summary>
A UK law that puts duties on online services (not on users) to reduce illegal harms and protect children. Separate parts of the law create or update offences for individuals (e.g., cyberflashing), but the core of the OSA is about what <em>services</em> must do.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Who created it and who pushed it over the line?</strong></summary>
Conceived under Conservatives since around 2019 [TODO: when? why? influences?](Theresa May → Dorries/Donelan/Sunak), 

The law passed (TODO: after what levels of review and feedback cycles from conception to delivery?, deeper question) in 2023. Labour supported the principle in opposition and accelerated implementation from 2024. 

Ofcom (the UK communications regulator) writes the codes and enforces them. TODO which are what, and what are the expected punishments for violating organisations? TODO: Another question on timeline for punishments after future reviews. 
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why did Labour keep/accelerate it after 2024?</strong></summary>
Manifesto pledge, strong public support for child protection, and a running Ofcom roadmap. It was faster to deliver and tune than to reopen the law (already received Royal assent in 2023 (TODO: Confirm [citation needed])). 

Labour also set strategic priorities to guide Ofcom’s approach TODO: which include what?.

<details>
<summary><strong>What services are in scope?</strong></summary>
Two main kinds:
- <strong>User‑to‑user services</strong> (places people can post or share content others can see, including DMs that can reach more than one person). [citation needed] TODO: 'more than one person would rule out DMs except group chat', define/investigate
- <strong>Search services</strong> (services that index and present results).
A service is in scope if it has a UK link (UK users, targets the UK, or is accessible here with material risk). Duties scale with size, features and risk.

TODO: Cite exact text from the law
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is <em>out</em> of scope?</strong></summary>
Exemptions include: basic one‑to‑one communications like standard email/SMS, internal business tools, and some limited‑function features. (Edge cases still have to check whether they’re truly exempt.) 

TODO 'limited-functions' defined please [citation needed]
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What the OSA <em>doesn’t</em> do</strong></summary>
- It doesn’t impose a general “ID for everyone.”
- It doesn’t ban end‑to‑end encryption (E2EE). Powers exist but only “if technically feasible,” and are not being used now. [citation needed]
- It doesn’t create blanket bans on legal speech for adults. Platforms must apply their own rules consistently and provide sensible controls and appeals.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What the OSA <em>does</em> require from services</strong></summary>
- <strong>Assess risks</strong> (illegal content; and for kids, content likely to harm) and keep those assessments up to date.
- <strong>Design and operate systems</strong> that reduce those risks (moderation, reporting, filters, safer defaults for kids).
- <strong>Use “highly effective” age assurance</strong> where needed (several methods are acceptable; self‑declaration is not).
- <strong>Be transparent</strong> (clear terms, complaints/appeals) and cooperate with Ofcom audits and information requests.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Key dates (high level)</strong></summary>
- <strong>Mar 2025</strong>: Illegal‑harms duties begin to bite; Ofcom starts enforcing.
- <strong>Jul 2025</strong>: Children’s codes and age‑assurance expectations go live for services likely to be accessed by children; porn sites must gate access.
- <strong>Through 2026</strong>: Phased codes, audits, transparency reporting and reviews continue.
