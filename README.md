# Better Britain Bureau — Project overview

This repo builds the [Better Britain Bureau site](https://betterbritain.org.uk/): a mix of longer reports and smaller “side‑quest” microsites that try to communicate one idea well. Content is mostly Markdown rendered with `markdown-it`, coordinated by a small site orchestrator. GitHub Actions build and deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Latest content update (13 Feb 2026)

The Year of Labour dataset was refreshed to cover the Sep 2025 → Feb 2026 period, adding/updating major items across energy (GBE delivery milestones, Local Power Plan, CfD AR7, grid connections/investment), water reform (Defra white paper direction), housing/planning (Renters’ Rights Act + commencements, Planning and Infrastructure Act, homelessness plan), labour market enforcement (Employment Rights Act + Fair Work Agency), borders/asylum (Border Security Act + asylum/returns statement), justice (Sentencing Act), digital regulation (DVS statutory regime, Online Safety enforcement milestones, digital assets property act), fiscal architecture (Budget 2025 / Finance Bill / CBAM draft regs), plus selected media/culture and governance events. The completed checklist is tracked in `TODO_NEW-POLICIES.md`.

## Run locally

1) Install deps: `npm i` (or `yarn`)
2) Dev server: `npm run dev` (serves `docs/` and live‑reloads)
3) Rebuild everything: `npm run build` (writes to `docs/`)

Other useful commands:
- `npm run coming-soon` — build a “coming soon” homepage (handy for staging)
- `npm run build:report:year` — build just the Year of Labour report

## Structure

- [`site/`](./site/) — site template/assets + build tooling (start at [`site/build-orchestrator.js`](./site/build-orchestrator.js))
- [`site/site.config.json`](./site/site.config.json) — registers reports and microsites (titles, descriptions, images, disabled flags)
- [`docs/`](./docs/) — build output (what Vite serves + what GitHub Pages deploys)
- [`pages/`](./pages/) — standalone pages in Markdown (e.g. [`pages/about.md`](./pages/about.md), [`pages/ai-policy.md`](./pages/ai-policy.md))
- [`posts/`](./posts/) — dated Markdown posts with front‑matter (built to `docs/posts/` + RSS)

Reports (built HTML pages, typically longer‑form):
- [`reports/year-of-labour/`](./reports/year-of-labour/) — live
- [`reports/osa-explainer/`](./reports/osa-explainer/) — live
- [`reports/gaming-and-radicalisation/`](./reports/gaming-and-radicalisation/) — placeholder / in progress
- [`reports/opening-all-the-windows-prison-reform/`](./reports/opening-all-the-windows-prison-reform/) — placeholder / in progress
- [`reports/manchester-fly-tipping/`](./reports/manchester-fly-tipping/) — placeholder / in progress
- [`reports/manchester-gp-practices-reviews/`](./reports/manchester-gp-practices-reviews/) — placeholder / in progress
- [`A Year of Labour/`](./A%20Year%20of%20Labour/) — source Markdown/dataset for the Year of Labour report

Microsites (small “side‑quests”, usually one page each):
- [`site/assets/microsites/immigrants-vs-billionaires/`](./site/assets/microsites/immigrants-vs-billionaires/)
- [`site/assets/microsites/labour-screw-ups/`](./site/assets/microsites/labour-screw-ups/)
- [`site/assets/microsites/billionaire-database/`](./site/assets/microsites/billionaire-database/)
- [`site/assets/microsites/what-brexit-costs/`](./site/assets/microsites/what-brexit-costs/)
- [`site/assets/microsites/woke-vs-antiwoke/`](./site/assets/microsites/woke-vs-antiwoke/) (currently disabled)
- [`site/assets/microsites/trickle-down-supply-chain/`](./site/assets/microsites/trickle-down-supply-chain/) (prototype folder; not wired into `site.config.json` yet)

## Authoring notes

- Write pages/posts in Markdown with optional front‑matter:
  - `title`, `date`, `description`, `image`
- Reports are generated by their builders and registered in `site/site.config.json`.
- The template outputs a body class per page type: `page-home`, `page-generic`, `page-posts-index`, `page-report` (used for background/theming in CSS).
- On the homepage, report cards can be flagged as placeholders or disabled in `site.config.json`. Disabled items remain clickable but render with a subtle “Not yet available” badge.

## Handy scripts

Some helper scripts live in [`scripts/`](./scripts/):
- [`scripts/chatgpt-export-to-md.js`](./scripts/chatgpt-export-to-md.js) — turn ChatGPT exports into Markdown
- [`scripts/find-missing-citations.js`](./scripts/find-missing-citations.js) — spot likely missing citations in Markdown content
- [`scripts/remove_stub_citation_dupes.js`](./scripts/remove_stub_citation_dupes.js) — clean up duplicated stub citations
- [`scripts/summarize-policies.js`](./scripts/summarize-policies.js) — rough summarisation helper for policy text
- [`scripts/retag-labour-screw-ups.py`](./scripts/retag-labour-screw-ups.py) — retag/normalise the Labour screw‑ups dataset
