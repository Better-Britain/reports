# Better Britain Bureau — Project overview

This repo powers the [Better Britain Bureau site](https://betterbritain.org.uk/) and the Broken Britain Briefing starting with the [Year of Labour Report](https://betterbritain.org.uk/year-of-labour.html). Content is mostly Markdown rendered with `markdown-it`, coordinated by a small site orchestrator. GitHub Actions build and deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Latest content update (13 Feb 2026)

The Year of Labour dataset was refreshed to cover the Sep 2025 → Feb 2026 period, adding/updating major items across energy (GBE delivery milestones, Local Power Plan, CfD AR7, grid connections/investment), water reform (Defra white paper direction), housing/planning (Renters’ Rights Act + commencements, Planning and Infrastructure Act, homelessness plan), labour market enforcement (Employment Rights Act + Fair Work Agency), borders/asylum (Border Security Act + asylum/returns statement), justice (Sentencing Act), digital regulation (DVS statutory regime, Online Safety enforcement milestones, digital assets property act), fiscal architecture (Budget 2025 / Finance Bill / CBAM draft regs), plus selected media/culture and governance events. The completed checklist is tracked in `TODO_NEW-POLICIES.md`.

## Run locally

1) Install deps: `npm i` (or `yarn`)
2) Dev server: `npm run dev` (serves `docs/` and live‑reloads)
3) Rebuild content: `npm run build` (writes to `docs/`)

## Structure

- `reports/` — per‑report builders (e.g. `reports/year-of-labour/build.js`)
- `A Year of Labour/` — source Markdown for the Year of Labour report
- `pages/` — standalone pages (About, Style Guide, AI Policy, …)
- `posts/` — blog posts (dated Markdown with front‑matter)
- `site/` — template, assets, and the orchestrator

## Authoring notes

- Write pages/posts in Markdown with optional front‑matter:
  - `title`, `date`, `description`, `image`
- Reports are generated by their builders and registered in `site/site.config.json`.
- The template outputs a body class per page type: `page-home`, `page-generic`, `page-posts-index`, `page-report` (used for background/theming in CSS).
- On the homepage, report cards can be flagged as placeholders or disabled in `site.config.json`. Disabled items remain clickable but render with a subtle “Not yet available” badge.

## Contributing

- Content is intended to be inspectable and reviewable.
- Scores are subjective but evidence‑led, critique scores with reasoning please.
- Pull Requests invited for substantive changes.
- File issues for tweaks with rationale.
