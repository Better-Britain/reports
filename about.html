<h2 id="who-we-are" tabindex="-1">Who we are</h2>
<p>BBB is Founded by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bobbigmac.bsky.social">Bob Davies</a> with the support of a small network of friends and advisors committed to practical, evidence‑led work.</p>
<h3 id="bobs-profile" tabindex="-1">Bob's profile</h3>
<p>I’ve worked in corporate problem‑solving/workflow and software engineering around the UK and in Manchester, and spent much of my time the last decade or so as a tech contractor working mainly on productivity and automation tools, usually through agencies working on infrastructure or civics projects.</p>
<p>I've been somewhat on the left and the right over the years, but don't think a simple spectrum captures any person or issue. I have no connections to any political party, significant/powerful business or people. Basically I'm <em>just some guy</em> who understands systems pretty well and has been on the internet long enough to recognise we're more divided than we've ever been. I think most people are decent and want things to work out for everyone, despite often not sharing priorities or perspectives.</p>
<p>When outcomes are bad, it’s <em>usually</em> the incentives and outcomes of bad systems at fault, rather than individuals. The aim is simple: cut through noise, learn about how new tools can help us, de‑radicalise with a focus on identifying the truth, and show where change can happen by sifting the noise to find the nuggets of data that can reasonably inform decisions, big and small.</p>
<p>I welcome feedback and contributors, either on the <a href="https://github.com/Better-Britain">Better Britain github repo</a> or via email to <a href="mailto:admin@betterbritain.org.uk">admin@betterbritain.org.uk</a>.</p>
