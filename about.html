<h3 id="bobs-personal-profile" tabindex="-1">Bob's personal profile</h3>
<p>I grew up in North Wales with a strong sense of Britishness. I’ve worked in corporate problem‑solving/workflows and software engineering around the UK and in Manchester, and spent much of my time the last decade or so self-employed as a tech contractor working mainly on productivity and automation tools, usually in agencies working for infrastructure or civics projects. I was diagnosed with Asperger’s early on, which means I tend to think in systems, but don't have much of a social sense, so in the early internet I spent time around nationalist and conspiratorial spaces, drawn to the anti‑authority tone. Friends’ real lives, my own experience working in complex projects, and what I saw of local policing and power kept me firmly in pragmatic reality.</p>
<p>I've been somewhat on the left and the right over the years, but don't think a single spectrum really captures any person or any issue. I think most people are decent and want things to work out for everyone, despite often not sharing priorities or perspectives. When outcomes are bad, it’s <em>usually</em> the incentives and outcomes of bad systems at fault, not individuals.</p>
<p>Better Britain Bureau is my way of turning my strengths into plain, useful reporting: clear facts, human impact, and accountability. I’m pro‑evidence, and open about using AI as a co‑editor/tool to improve clarity and increase throughput, not to replace judgement. The aim is simple: cut through noise, de‑radicalise by identifying the truth clearly, and show where change is possible by identifying the limitations and opportunities of the complex systems that rule our lives.</p>
