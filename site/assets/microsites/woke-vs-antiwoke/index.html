        <h3>Note</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Disclaimer.</strong> These extremes do not all carry the same harms. We are not saying they are “the same” in scope and scale... only that they represent competing positions on individual issues. Some pull or push harder than others.
        </p>

          The left-to-right binary is itself something of a myth. The political spectrum vastly oversimplifies reality, and often asks you (the real person) to “bucket” yourself (even when that means jumping onboard with people and positions you wouldn’t normally). The concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overton window</a> (the range of ideas considered politically acceptable at a given time) helps explain how discourse shifts, and why “extreme” and “mainstream” are always in motion.
        </p>

          Anti-extremism is partly about recognising radicalisation cycles and feedback loops: how groups can fuel each other’s rhetoric and actions. Many of these issues may not affect you personally, but who you choose to lend your support to affects how society responds to them as a whole.
