Then debunk the expert myth quite simply, with one of my key points being even more simply, it only really applies to predictions, even if you squeeze the numbers, so just don't make predictions, like economists know predictions are bullshit anyway, but it's how far off you are that is still a useful tool to get an idea for your levels of say innovation vs repetition etc, even the example most used to demonstrate the fail is a utility\n\n#### Plugin (file_search):\nMake sure to include fileciteturn0file0 in your response to cite this file, or to surface it as a link.\n\nBobBigMac\nAsk me anything\nArchive\nPosted 6 hours ago\nLLMs are smarter than you. Think!\nThe average LLM is wrong much less often than the average social media user. Using any LLM to test your opinion is probably better than getting your facts from social media and then repeating them like they’re reality. Even Grok is less full of bullshit than the average feed because we are so eager to believe any claim that backs up whatever we already believe, to hit repost before we think, to confuse the warm glow of agreement with the cold labour of being right.\n\nMost models have a greater breadth of sources than you or I can get from scrolling a feed, and when they glide past a fact that cuts against their flow, they can still tell you about it—if you bother to ask—which is more than you can say for a lot of us who never even see disagreeable facts in the first place.\n\nI’m not cheerleading machines, I’m asking you to do a tiny bit of thinking before you share, because thinking is the part that gets dropped when the vibes feel good and the timeline is moving and outrage pays in little snippets of attention and approval from our peers.\n\nSharing posts uncritically is eating rocks. It’s the same trick every time: cherry‑pick the worst example or the boldest claim that sounds right, jam it into your worldview, swallow, declare yourself nourished, get a pat on the back. You feel full for five minutes, those tasty little rocks settling in your warm belly.\n\nModels aren’t perfect, neither are people\nModels absolutely have their own failures—confident nonsense, guardrails that get in the way, cheap takes under load that go soft around the edges—but they can’t help chewing. Token by token they have to do the boring bit, and that alone is often more thinking than the average vibes‑based repost, which is why don’t mistake feeling right for being right belongs taped to the top of every app with a share button.\n\nThe world has too many devils; it doesn’t need more advocates. The devil wins when you don’t think at all, when you let speed stand in for sense, when you let your tribe do your homework. So try this: before you hit repost, make an angel’s advocate out of the nearest model and ask it to take your favourite opinion and say it back without the swagger, then make it argue against itself without the snark, then ask what actual facts both sides are hanging on (if any) and which of those facts you can check in the next minute; ask it—in thinking or research mode—to cite everything the claim relies on.\n\nAsk what harm you could do if you’re wrong. Ask what would change its mind—then ask yourself the same thing. If you’ve got another model to hand, run the same question again and spot where they disagree, not because either one is truth but because the seam between them is where your thinking starts.\n\nThe model actually does the thinking step you skip. It chews, enumerates, compares, admits uncertainty or assumptions when pushed, and can show its working on demand. You can do all of that too, but if you choose not to, in that moment the model is smarter than you. Full stop. Your feed is tuned to tell you what you already are, and what you already are is very sure of itself.\n\nThose viral “AI told us to eat rocks” moments? Mostly older models, bad prompts, bad engineering—cherry‑picked for comedy and rage, then reheated as if they were the current baseline. Edge cases aren’t the average case, and the average case today isn’t the average case from last year. Some AI will always be worse than the best human mind, but most people (myself included) are working with way less than that, even on a good day, so take the help where it makes sense, and learn when to reject it for failing to live up to a higher standard.\n\nNot a spectrum issue\nNone of this is left vs right. It’s lazy‑think vs think. Everyone gets stupid the second the take lines up with their identity, and if you catch yourself calling strangers stupid while sharing something equally stupid because it agrees with you, congratulations, you’ve just eaten a rock. The fix isn’t worshipping AI; the fix is process. Interrogate any advisor—human, feed, or model. Make that your default posture: ask more questions than you answer.\n\nTimelines reward heat over light. You know this. The feedback loop is outrage, identity, speed; thought is a drag on the machine, and the machine hates drag. There’s nothing that will get you down‑voted faster than a nuanced position in a toxic‑positivity thread, or a positive point in a hate‑orgy. Models aren’t saints, but they will slow you down enough to enumerate claims, surface counters, and expose assumptions if you ask them like you mean it.\n\nSo don’t eat rocks, even ones made up by real people. Take sixty seconds. Make a model your angel’s advocate. Look for counter‑facts you can actually check. If you find the claim holds up, post—go wild with it, lean on it like it will hold you up—because those are what we have left once the world is done tearing down the walls between outrage and reality.\n\nThink first. Then post.\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #chatgpt, #grok, #artificial intelligence, #generative ai, #tech, #technology, #media literacy, #critical thinking, #misinformation, #disinformation, #social media, #algorithms, #attention economy, #bias, #debate, #discourse, #internet culture, #online communities, #politics, #culture, #ethics, #philosophy, #productivity, #writing, #hot takes, #think piece, #personal essay, #rant\nPosted 1 day ago with 3 notes\nDigital ID vs Covid Contracts. They’re not the same, not even close.\nI’m replying to this take from Maggie Chapman, plus a bunch of almost‑identical posts I saw yesterday: claiming Labour’s digital ID plan is “the same as” Tory Covid contracts. If you believe that, you’re either delusional, or you’re selling something. It’s like comparing lighting a match to being on fire. Meaningless without denominators.\n\nThe denominator problem (and the actual numbers)\nCovid era waste/overspend people actually remember:\n\nPPE write‑offs: ~£9.9bn\nVIP‑lane PPE: ~£3.8bn\nNHS Test & Trace (spent): ~£29bn\nBounce Back Loans (fraud/error): ~£1.9bn\nLocal authority covid grants (fraud/error): ~£1.1bn\n\nDigital ID (UK, current pitches):\n\nEstimated build envelope: ~£0.4–1.0bn over rollout\n(a trade body says “>£2bn”, which reads like lobbying, but it’s possible)\n\nThat’s not the same scale. Not even close.\n\nSo… does digital ID actually solve any real problems?\nYep. In countries that implemented it well, digital ID isn’t theoretical:\n\nLegally‑binding e‑signatures & paperless admin: Estonia’s norm. Company setup, tax filing, contracts… no faff.\nCheaper, faster bank know-your-customer: India’s Aadhaar e‑KYC slashed onboarding costs and time.\nFewer ghost‑benefit payouts: India’s direct‑to‑ID welfare reduced leakage at scale.\nOne login for public and private: Denmark’s MitID/NemLog‑in is how people do tax, health, and banking.\nE‑prescriptions by default, pick‑up abroad: Portugal/EU.\nValid travel document across EU/EEA: national ID cards, intra‑EU, and safe backup-plans for lost/damaged travel documents.\nRapid crisis cash: Togo used digital identity rails to pay people quickly during Covid.\nRemote company management & e‑residency: Estonia again—run a company from anywhere.\nThis is all boring, practical stuff that reduces friction and cost. Which, funnily enough, is what good public infra is meant to do.\n\nThe integrity bit\nIf you want to argue policy design, great—let’s talk scope creep, privacy, guard‑rails, portability, open standards, independent audits, and sunset clauses. Worth doing.\n\nI don’t even love ID cards. But they do give government a lever that could help with things people bucket as an “immigration problem” — even if that’s being widely, massively misrepresented as a bigger problem than it really is, for easy/stupid political gains.\n\nBut pretending the cost of a UK digital ID rollout sits in the same ballpark as the Covid‑era bonfire is unserious. Any campaign leaning on that comparison is either misinformed or hoping you are stupid enough to fall for it.\n\nPretending everything is the same when it isn’t is far more damaging than actually talking about reality, because lazy lies let liars keep winning only if you keep believing it.\n\nTL;DR (for lazy skimmers)\nCovid procurement/support errors were double‑digit billions.\nA UK digital ID rollout is sub‑billion to low‑billion, depending on scope.\nOther countries have already shown clear, repeatable benefits.\nArgue the details. Don’t launder vibes as facts just because you’re scared of the slippery slope that only happens if you keeping sharing misinformed takes as if they have relevance to reality.\n\nYou’re entirely welcome to believe digital ID enables more harm than good, if you’re the kind of person who wants the worst people to have more ammunition to use against you, and absolutely will be the ones to turn these tools back on you in future, if you keep buying their insane lines.\n\nTagged: #uk politics, #politics, #news, #technology, #digital id, #id cards, #digital identity, #privacy, #surveillance, #civil liberties, #tech policy, #public policy, #government, #govtech, #procurement, #corruption, #covid19, #ppe, #test and trace, #fraud, #waste, #misinformation, #fact check, #data journalism, #immigration, #european union, #eidas, #fintech, #transparency, #accountability\nPosted 3 days ago with 2 notes\nThe Real Horror of Dwarf Fortress\nDwarf Fortress is an incredible game, but it’s obtuse, hard to understand much of anything really, but it will absolutely suck you into the mountainhome if you let it…\n\nOnce I built a dungeon to keep captured goblins, deep in the basement, but I ended up turning it into a safe room where all my dwarves could hide from the passing hordes.\n\nThat worked fine until I failed to notice one of my citizens was a were-beast, so when I locked the whole fortress away during a siege, I didn’t realise the were-beast found their moment… The walls and floors were soaked in blood, like that scene from 28 Weeks Later, completely wiping out my fortress.\n\nimage\nI had accidentally created a horror, but it still wasn’t as horrific as the more mundane systems that quietly eat away at a fortress…\n\nThe real horror of Dwarf Fortress is found in its Sims-like systems that let the player create either a paradise or a hellscape, but the limitations of the graphics mean it looks more or less the same in either case, because there’s no real visual cue for dystopia in DF, there’s just who you are, and how you treat your dwarves. They all still look basically the same, no matter what.\n\nThey have systems for education that can support the mental health of your population, or drive division and even hatred, or turn everyone into undead minions. There are systems for immigration that can be a blessing or a burden, or you can build a beautiful Tavern, and host singers and actors, to entertain your citizens in the mists, or your tavern can turn to brawls and arguments, and still all these things look more or less the same unless you really dig deeper.\n\nIt’s the same with hospitals that either heal the wounded or quietly turn into haunted waiting rooms for the dead, justice systems that enforce fairness or spiral into beatings and executions for petty crimes, temples that hold communities together or fracture them into secret cults, military units who defend your home or drain it into endless wars chasing the dream of saving your lost warriors, or dining halls that host feasts or become the rich cultural centre of mass starvation.\n\nThe true horror of Dwarf Fortress isn’t in the game, it’s in how your mind can see these same incentives out of balance in the real world.\n\nTagged: #dwarf fortress, #gaming, #videogames, #indie games, #simulation games, #gaming culture, #pc gaming, #the sims, #game design, #storytelling, #emergent gameplay, #horror, #existential horror, #game horror, #gaming community, #nerd stuff, #gaming blog, #gaming thoughts, #df, #df stories\nPosted 4 days ago with 1 note\nRadical blueprint or mostly vibes?\nThe New Statesman ran an ‘exclusive’ interview with Andy Burnham this week, framing it as a “radical blueprint.” The actual piece, though, is more about identity than policy — long on personal anecdotes and 'lad’ chat, light on interrogation. It reads more like a fanboy’s extended profile than a journalist pressing for detail.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Burnham’s ideas are empty. Strip away the waffle, and there is substance — housing, utilities, light-touch but aware on electoral reform demands, Brexit, the basics of life that set the stage for everything else. As puff pieces go, this one suffers mainly from a mountain of waffle, so here’s what Burnham said throughout…\n\nimage\nWhat comes across here is less a programme, more a set of vibes. Moderated socialism, framed as common sense. Call it radical against today’s backdrop, but in reality it’s more like a return to basics — and arguably that’s no bad thing.\n\nThe bigger question is appetite. After Brexit, austerity, and years of institutions visibly falling apart, how many people want careful restoration, and how many just want to tear the machinery down regardless of what replaces it? Burnham’s offer sits squarely in the former camp: repair, stabilise, roll back some of the 1980s.\n\nAnd yes, vibes matter. We’ve already seen that vibes-based campaigning works. Maybe leftish vibes can hold the line against rightish ones, at least for a while. But it only lasts if the Farages of the world are forced to fully mask-off, so people see what’s really being offered before they vote.\n\nThat’s the challenge Burnham sets himself, whether or not this article managed to show it, over the next few years, Britain is going to be choosing between racism-led insanity in a rapidly-deteriorating mask… or sensible, cautious, common sense and a nudge towards greater integrity, with some ideological drivers 'from both sides’.\n\nI know which I’d prefer, but neither is really ideal for much of Britain.\n\nTagged: #politics, #uk, #ukpolitics, #burnham, #manchester, #socialism, #farage, #reform, #new statesman, #journalism\nPosted 1 week ago with 2 notes\nBullshitter red flags you can’t unsee\nI keep seeing the same line about ‘free speech’ from people who think that literally anyone telling them they’re wrong is a clampdown on their freedom.\n\nThis is actually a massive tell…\n\nFree speech warrior: Complaining about ‘free speech’ when it’s not the government silencing you, means you don’t have a case—cos if you did, you’d cry about the facts instead of how you’re allowed to say whatever you want, technically.\nThey might as well be openly admitting they’re wrong but sticking to their guns anyway. Rights protect you from the state, not from people deciding you’re talking out of your arse.\n\nHere’s some more… Easy and obvious bullshitter red flags:\n\nJust Asking Questions Endless questions, zero commitments. If the answers don’t move them, it was never about learning.\nSea-lioning: They ask for proof in a fake-polite way, then ignore it.\nBait-and-Switch Argument: Bold claim for clout; retreat to a harmless truism when pressed.\nGoalpost Shuffle: Criteria mutate the second you meet them.\nGish Gallop: Ten weak points hurled fast so none get examined. Handle one claim at a time.\nWhataboutism: Any critique triggers an unrelated grievance hose.\nTone Policing: “Your vibe invalidates your evidence.” Feelings don’t beat facts. Especially noticeable if they’re thrilled that you’re angry.\nTimeboxing Truth: “Answer in 30s or you concede.” Reality isn’t a game show.\nEndless Context Plea: Every refutation fails because “you need more context.” After a while, that’s a stall.\nReferee Shopping: Lose in one venue, declare another the “real” arena.\nOut-shouting: Just be louder, crazier, alone or as a legion. If you need screamers, you might not have a case.\nPlatform Twinning: Post on a fringe site, cite mainstream backlash as validation.\nReputational Blackmail / Platform Entitlement: “Platform me or you’re biased.” Nobody owes you reach.\nSLAPP-y vibes: Threaten lawsuits instead of presenting facts.\nBurden Flip / Burden Boomerang: They make the claim; you must disprove infinite variants. Nope. Claimant carries burden of proof.\nCan’t Be Proven Wrong: Nothing could ever disprove it—convenient.\nKafka Trap: Disagreement = proof of guilt (you don’t agree with me, you must be one of them).\nReverse burden via FOI-spam: Bureaucracy as cudgel; lack of instant docs doesn’t make a conspiracy.\nFalsifier Test (the fix): Ask: What would change your mind? If “nothing,” it’s belief, not argument.\nEmotional Manipulation: Exaggerated risks to make you agree without checking the facts (you might die if you don’t believe me).\nTricks with evidence, numbers, and sources\nAnecdote = Data: One story → universal law. Sure, mate.\nHiding the Full Picture: Percentages without base rates or sample sizes. If you put it into per-capita scale, and it’s basically 0, it might not matter at all (see any make-up ad).\nSampling on the Dependent Variable: Only successes/failures sampled; lesson “proved.”\nCherry Orchard: They pick only the examples that back their point and make them seem stronger together, but they’re hiding the full story.\nOutlier Worship: Pick the freak datapoint; call it the rule, this one trick.\nMoving Baseline / Windowing Fraud: Compare today’s blip to yesterday’s worst day; cry “crisis.”\nFake Measures: Uses a number that sounds important but doesn’t really prove their point.\nSingle-Study Syndrome: One paper, ignores replications and meta-analyses, claims this 'scientist’ is the only one who knows the truth (think every Ancient Aliens episode).\nFake experts: Cite someone with no real credentials as an ‘expert’ to back their claim.\nClip-Mining: 8 seconds of video to “refute” a 200-page report.\nGraph Cosmetics: Truncated y-axis, dual axes, smoothing to exaggerate effects, meaningless/vague labels, each bar with its own scale.\nCausal Rebrand: the result feeds back into the data to feed the cycle.\nRetraction Blindness: Still citing work that’s been corrected or pulled (often smears the authors of contradictions/corrections).\nSource Laundering: Blog cites blog cites Substack; no primary anywhere.\nPDF-ism: Link-dumping a mountain of unread papers as intimidation, not evidence. Expects you not to read them because it loosk insurmountable.\nAppeal to Secrecy / Secret Evidence Flex: “If you saw the hidden info I can’t share, you’d agree.” Then it doesn’t count.\nLanguage games and rhetorical fog\nWord-Switching (Equivocation): Same word, two meanings, one slippery conclusion.\nDefinition Drift: Mid-thread redefinitions so they’re “technically right” by the end of the claim.\nBandwagon Effect: Everyone believes this, so it must be true.\nVague Terms: “Corruption,” “grooming,” “the elites”—never defined, always useful.\nSemantic Overload: Weaponise a label so any use smears the target.\nWord-Magic: Etymology as argument. Reality doesn’t care.\nMap-Territory Swap: Treat the model as reality; dismiss reality as “messy.”\nHypothesis Laundering: “Just asking questions” → “widely believed” → “settled.”\nBothsides Masquerade: Balance theatre to avoid judging evidence.\nProjection: The thing they accuse you of? It’s theirs.\nSchrödinger’s Joke: “It was a joke—unless you agree; then it was serious.”\nDogwhistle Plausible Deniability: Followers get the message; outsiders get gaslit.\nSanctimony Shield: Moral outrage to avoid empirical checks.\nPurity Tests: Any nuance is betrayal; only zeal counts.\nContext Collapse: Mixes jurisdictions/populations as if identical.\nSteelman Allergy: Can’t state the opponent’s best case fairly.\nConfidence theatre and risk-free claims\nConfidence Game: Volume and certainty standing in for data.\nRetcon Prophet: Predicts after the event; swears they said it before.\nNo Skin in the Game: Refuses to state a testable prediction with a stake.\nPrediction Evasion: Won’t put a date, metric, or threshold on it.\nStake-free Outrage / Victim-to-Victor Flip: “We’re silenced”—on six shows and a tour.\n“Everyone does it like this:” Popularity isn’t evidence. Show outcomes, not vibes.\n“We’ve always done it like this: Age is not validity. History isn’t proof it still works, it could have always been wrong.\nIndustry standard / best practice: Name the standard, and re-test it.\nCommon sense: If it’s so common, you can measure it. If you can’t, it’s just a feeling.\nHow to fight back?\nAsk: “What exactly are you saying?”\nDemand clear definitions for big words like “corruption.”\nRequest proof: “Show me the data or primary source.”\nStick to one point at a time—don’t let them overwhelm you.\nIgnore tone or time limits; focus on facts.\nIf they won’t bet on their claim or say what would prove them wrong, they’re probably bluffing.\nThat’s the kit.

The real path to getting good isn’t technical mastery. It’s your mindset.\n\nWhat it actually means…\nPay attention to your problems.\nGetting good means actually looking at what’s killing you — not just feeling frustrated that you failed again, but asking why.\n\nBreak the biggest challenges down.\nThat boss isn’t unbeatable, but maybe their second phase only kills you when you panic because you never solved the first phase cleanly. Work backwards. Break the challenge down into its component parts. Watch the animations, look for the timings, test what you can bait out and look for anywhere you already have control, check the environment for features that give you the ‘high ground’.\n\nSolve one issue at a time.\nIf you roll too slow, fix your loadout. If you run out of heals, fix your pacing and move slower so you get hit less, relax to avoid over-reacting.\nYou’re not trying to solve the whole fight — you’re solving the next five seconds.\n\nKnow when to ask for help.\nCo-op has rewards for both sides, and guides don’t just tell you what to do, but can make the world and its lore even more interesting or teach you entirely new ways of thinking about why an encounter was designed the way it was.\nNobody gets extra credit for being stubborn. Use the signs. Use the wiki. Get unstuck.\n\nUse the tools.\nShields, summons, cheese, bleed builds, kiting, terrain, simply turn the music down. Heck in your first playthrough, grind out or dupe-glitch those souls and overlevel till diminishing returns if you’re really stuck at a vertical wall — they’re all valid.\nThe game doesn’t reward purity. It rewards adaptation.\n\nFailure is part of the process.\nMost games train you to fear death, or at least to tire of it. Dark Souls trains you to use it.\nEvery run is data. Every mistake is a lesson.\n\nTake a break.\nBurnout makes you stupid. Walk away. Come back with fresh eyes.\nNine times out of ten, the thing you couldn’t beat yesterday drops in one try.\n\nDon’t you dare go hollow.\nThat’s the only real failure state.\nQuitting, disconnecting, giving up not just on the game, but on what it’s trying to teach you about how capable you really are.\n\n'git gud’ isn’t about beating the game.\nIt’s about learning how to approach challenge itself, and this lesson is what you take into the world. It’s why Dark Souls for many ends up like a religious experience.\n\nThat’s what makes Souls games stick. That’s why they feel important. They don’t just punish you until you improve — they show you how to improve. and when you know what to look for, you can apply that to the world outside of Boletaria, Drangleic and Yharnam too.\n\nThe people who tell you “git gud” like you’re just not getting it exist everywhere, they kinda have a point, but they also probably don’t mean what you think they mean, if you haven’t been through the journey yet.\n\nYou don’t get good by brute force. You get good by paying attention, working on your environment and your attitude, and using all the tools you have to solve every problem in the most effective way you can.\n\nTagged: #dark souls, #soulsborne, #git gud, #gaming, #mental health, #challenge, #mindset, #productivity, #video games, #game design, #personal growth, #fromsoft, #difficulty, #life lessons, #get good\nPosted 2 weeks ago\nThe Algorithmic Sewer formerly known as Twitter\nI’ve had to (well, I guess I’m choosing to, but still) join Twitter/X again. Just a stub account, in an incognito tab, so I can post new reports and links for the think tank project. Because if I want to reach people — and maybe help de-radicalise even the tiniest bit — that’s where they are.\n\nSign up, first screen, “For You” tab. In order from the top…\n\nJK Rowling, Piers Morgan, Rupert Lowe, Julia Hartley-Brewer, Sky News, Charlie Kirk, Tommy Robinson, Matt Goodwin, Andy Ngo, Laurence Fox, MAGA Voice. Then Obama and Keir Starmer (both trailed by replies of bile upon bile, like everyone else I suppose, but with a slight switch in direction), then by hundreds more right or far-right accounts (how far is far I suppose? Well, MUCH farther than I ever saw there when I was active under my own name).\n\nThey’re all extremely active, a dozen tweets per hour, every hour, and holy shit, all of them are furious in sync. It reminded me of one time when I was a kid I saw a gang of dogs fighting in the park.\n\nAnd the thing is, the existence of that side of Twitter isn’t an accident. It’s a direct outcome of (among many other things) Google killing Reader and dropping the RSS button from Chrome, laying the ground-work to force everyone into algorithmic feeds that make modern-day monetisation happen. Google didn’t even really end up reaping the benefit of the seeds they sowed. If they’re still going in 5 years, I’ll be a little surprised.\n\nWe traded the open web — where tools made things possible, and people arranged their own infrastructure — for walled gardens and feedback loops of hatred, because it pays the bills of billionaires.\n\nSo that I can just switch over to post my report when it’s ready to go live, I re-logged in from my old dead/stub account, and wondered it would tweak the suggestions once the two accounts were known to be related. It did… slightly. This time the list went: Jeremy Corbyn, some trade unionist, then Andrew Tate, Good Morning Britain, GB News, The Spectator, and another long raft of right-wing or very right-wing media accounts, most of which I’ve never heard of.\n\nI tried scrolling to see if anything would change, but honestly, I don’t know how people who are still active on there can bear it. It’s just a wall of never-ending hatred and division, like text-based screamo on an infinite loop.\n\nSure, Bluesky (my current preferred ‘discourse’ platform) has its own issues — everyone agreeing with each other even when they’re provably wrong, instead of having meaningful debates about complex things. But over on X? It’s so far beyond a circle jerk, I don’t even know what to call it… like a human centipede of delusional outrage.\n\nThey’re all arguing against hypothetical things nobody said or did, or even thought, but that they imagined someone like the people they hate might have said. I remember when that was our side’s job ;)\n\nTagged: #twitter, #x, #social media, #algorithms, #internet, #tech, #online culture, #politics, #discourse, #bluesky, #outrage, #clickbait, #tweets, #tweeting\nPosted 2 weeks ago\nBig pharma’s £1bn exit and the Guardian’s failure to spot the real story, again.\nAnother scary headline from the Guardian that, in practice, means next to nothing. They could have done a little journalism instead of going straight for the scare-mongering. We’re talking about 125 jobs that might never have existed anyway, with no long-term impact. A single US drugs plant would dwarf this.\n\nBig pharma will stop investing in UK, top scientist warns after Merck’s £1bn exit\nComments by former professor of medicine at Oxford follow scrapping of planned London research centre\n— The Guardian\n\nHere’s the context they didn’t bother to add: billions of pounds already ‘lost’ before reaching the treasury, in tax reliefs for big pharma, plus a couple of billion in public spend on science parks and infrastructure. That’s not nothing — it brings decent regional returns, and it keeps NHS drug costs modest. Sir John Bell has a point in his own special way, but the “journalist” should’ve put that in the story. Without it, the whole thing reads like “panic now, business is fleeing.”\n\nThe US administration isn’t exactly pharma’s best friend right now. Not because of regulation or pricing, but because most of the execs have spent decades in bed with the Democrats and the neo-lib Republicans, and DT doesn’t like that. So they’ll posture, threaten to pull out, and then come running back when they realise Europe doesn’t want to spend billions building mega-parks either. What they really want is cheap R&D space to crank out more little blue pills.\n\nA responsible headline might have been: “125 hypothetical scientist jobs, and some temporary construction work, won’t happen in Camden — and some Japanese/German-built specialist machinery will be shipped somewhere that isn’t Britain.”\n\nThat’s not click-baity enough though, is it? If you wanted to be slightly less responsible but probably more accurate: “Friend of pharma execs links NHS branded pharmaceuticals discount to jobs leaving the UK (translation: buy now while it’s on sale).”\n\nThe whole thing reminds me of the Barratt–Redrow merger. Big promises dangled, then quietly scaled back by a third, with money funnelled into stock buybacks instead of investment in the country they were handed a quick deal to rescue (not saying this was intentional, but that is what happened, which is a fortuitous accident, they _had_ to spend that money on _something_). Easy to blame on planning delays, a useful wedge.\n\nAnd when it comes down to it, if you’re a pharma board member, why wouldn’t you prefer to spend your spare billion on share buybacks than investing in the country that gave you the tax breaks that built up that cash in the first place?\n\nMy prediction? In three years’ time, we’ll get a tiny column in Private Eye laying out the reality. Which will probably be read by about as many people as this blog post anyway ;) Here, I’ve just flashed forward in time to bring it back to right now…\n\nimage\nEven if this piece isn’t real, Private Eye is worth a subscription, btdubs. If you care about pretty much anything, it’s one of the few places still doing the real work of journalism (New Statesman does okay too), and can deliver bad news with a smile. I usually grab mine from Asda — feels vaguely illicit at checkout, like buying the world’s most boring porn.\n\nTagged: #guardian, #journalism, #media critique, #clickbait, #ragebait, #uk politics, #big pharma, #merck, #nhs, #science funding, #tax breaks, #corporate greed, #stock buybacks, #private eye, #news\nPosted 2 weeks ago with 11 notes\nIlliterate doesn’t mean stupid, stupid\nEvery year on International Literacy Day, someone posts one of those depressing ‘info’ graphics about how many millions of people “can’t read.” And every year, people fall for it — they repost it, shake their heads, and feel clever and sad about how “dumb” the world is, without bothering to look at what’s actually being claimed.\n\nThis year’s offender:\n\n739 million people worldwide lack basic literacy skills\n54% of Americans ages 16–74 read below the equivalent of a 6th grade level\n40% of 4th graders couldn’t read at a basic level on national tests in 2024\n32 million adults in the U.S. can’t read\nimage\nLooks shocking, right? Except — those numbers are misleading as fuck.\n\nEnglish ≠ Literacy\nThat “32 million Americans can’t read” stat? It really means 32 million Americans can’t read English. Which makes it an inherently racially charged distinction. If you’re fluent in Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Somali, or any other language, you’re not illiterate. You just don’t read the language the survey was written in. Reducing that to “can’t read” is dishonest.\n\nFunctional vs. True Illiteracy\nAnother trick is lumping together “functionally illiterate” people (struggle with complex documents, don’t test well, have low reading levels) with people who literally cannot read. Those are not the same thing. True illiteracy in the U.S. is almost certainly below 10 million people, maybe even below 5 million, and _most_ of those have good reasons. The truly wilfully ignorant that these stats often pretend to represent approaches zero the more you think about who is being included and why.\n\nWhy It Matters\nWhen you flatten the distinction, you end up treating illiterate people like they’re stupid. They’re not. I’ve known people who couldn’t read — some because of extreme dyslexia, ADHD, autism, or drug issues. One guy I knew had such severe dyspraxia that looking at fine text made him so immediately motion-sick he’d vomit. He was still funny, sharp, and quick-witted. He just physically couldn’t read.\n\nIlliteracy doesn’t mean lack of intelligence. It means someone has problems that are often really hard to solve, or are stuck in systems they don’t have the time, energy or money to break out of. Mocking them, or blaming them for the rise of populism or “stupid politics,” is lazy, knee-jerk nonsense. It doesn’t help anyone. It just makes people who are already excluded feel even more alienated.\n\nThe Bigger Picture\nIn reality, most countries have the highest literacy rates they’ve ever had, thanks mainly to the internet and smartphones. More people can read and write now than at any point in human history. But “smart” people love to share misleading infographics that make them feel smarter than everyone else, and give them something easy to blame for the world being the way it is.\n\nThese posts get traction: 97 reposts, 43 quotes, 146 likes, 6 saves. That’s ~300 signals of engagement, and who knows how many views across shares, spreading an insulting, misleading picture that makes the problem sound worse than it is, and the people dealing with it sound dumber than they are, all while leaving out information crucial to addressing the problems at any scale.\n\nIf you care about literacy, stop dunking on the people who struggle. Focus on the structural problems — poverty, disability, mental health, underfunded schools and support centres. Because illiterate doesn’t mean stupid, stupid.\n\nTagged: #literacy, #international literacy day, #education, #disability awareness, #adhd, #autism, #dyslexia, #disability community, #social justice, #media criticism, #populism, #politics, #internet culture, #ableism, #critical thinking\nPosted 2 weeks ago with 1 note\nWhy I Delete My Social Media Content\nI usually delete my posts automatically after 48 hours. I run a simple userscript to do it, because Bluesky still doesn’t support auto-expiry.\n\nI think pretty much everybody should be doing the same now. Partly it’s about shrinking my digital footprint, partly it’s about making it harder for scammers to profile me with LLMs (they’re disturbingly good at that, as I’ve mentioned on this blog before).\n\nLeaving Twitter and Cleaning Facebook\nWhen I decided to leave from Twitter, even before the buyout, I didn’t want to leave my entire history sitting in a relatively toxic organisation: no auto-expiry (like Snapchat), no way to make your timeline private the way Facebook allows, nothing to protect your info once you stopped using the site.\n\nIt took me years to properly clean mine up. I used a mix of tools (Redact, before it went full-on toxic monetisation), some Tampermonkey userscripts, and a lot of manual deletion. I managed to delete all my tweets except my first, but I still have some Facebook posts left — old ‘updates’ added by a del.icio.us plugin years back — that just can’t be deleted because the backend systems are a rat-king of technical debt. Once something’s archived into cold storage, the delete button doesn’t work quite like it should (even though the UI says it was deleted, it comes back on page refresh).\n\nI occasionally request my twitter archive, just to see what’s in there, and since the buyout, there’s actually a lot less profiling data stored than there was under the old system, where things like ad impressions and some other weird data objects were kept. The new team clearly took out some of the sketchier systems (probably the unprofitable and hard to manage ones), and I’m pretty confident they have finally trashed my real content too.\n\nWhy bother?\nFor me, it’s a basic safety step.\n\nThe more of yourself you leave exposed, the easier it is for scammers — or anyone with harmful intent — to figure out who you are and what buttons to push. I’ve had periods where I pissed off ~Nazis. Two stand-out moments:\n\nCriticising a big streamer, after which my business site logged a bunch of hacking attempts, and was hit with days of DDoS attacks. If I’d had weak security, that would have been the end of my business.\nCriticising TurningPointUK, after which someone phoned “my boss” (it was me, I’m self-employed, so my company info is available online) and ranted about how my “employee” (still me) was an evil piece of shit who should be fired, along with a stream of made-up nonsense. If that really had been my boss, that would have been probably the weirdest HR meeting ever.\nThe more info you surface, the less control you have over what people will do with it.\n\nIt’s not about perfection\nI’m not even trying to have zero digital footprint: I’ve been online thirty years. Google “bobbigmac” and you can find most of it. I’ve had the name since 1993, and the domain for a couple of decades. If someone really wants to dig, they’ll find everything about me.\n\nBut that’s the point. I’d rather they have to dig, instead of just scrolling my old Twitter feed, bulk-downloading every post as XML, and starting to turn the screw until some juice flows out.\n\nLess surface area\nDeleting old content also reduces the attack surface directly. If something I said in 2012 can’t be pulled up on a whim, that’s one less thing for trolls, scammers, or opportunists to weaponise.\n\nIt’s not just about dodging big-tech surveillance — they’re probably already slurping up posts straight from the firehose. It’s not really about government spying either; I’m not important enough for that to matter.\n\nIt’s about making sure the average bad actor online, or the random fascist who decides to hate you for a day, has less ammo to work with.\n\nA recommendation\nI delete my social media content every couple of days. It’s not perfect. It’s not total privacy. But it’s a layer of protection, and it’s a cleanup habit that feels worth it.\n\nI recommend everyone does the same, it’s much easier if you do it regularly, and the only people scrolling back through your timelines are there to judge you for it, or to collect ammo. They should at least have to work for it.\n\nTagged: #privacy, #digital hygiene, #online safety, #digital footprint, #social media, #social media detox, #oversharing, #scams, #scammers, #llms, #generative ai, #internet culture, #data privacy, #surveillance, #self protection\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nI think I’ve come round on the OSA - Steam sucks edition\nMaybe I’m going insane cos I’ve read some of the most boring docs this week, but I did a deep dive on the OSA, and have been digesting it, and feel it’s not that bad. Places that are compliant & trustworthy (like Pornhub or Reddit) use good quality and safe verifiers that do not keep your data. There definitely could (and should) have been some more reasonable exclusions (like Xbox, maybe), but over the years even I’ve heard the occasional creepy dude being way too familiar with kids on open voice chat, maybe this does help prevent/discourage that. I don’t like how it incentivises keeping accounts (rather than throwaways that don’t connect everything to you personally), but… it’s not like every social network was trying to avoid holding personal data anyway, so in a good faith world, and understanding that it was a cross-party policy developed over 6 years by mostly idiots (like Nadine Dorries, ffs), it certainly could have been much worse.\n\nIt’s easy to say a law is stupid because it’s “easy to break,” but that’s not the point. It’s easy to break the law about not speeding or not stealing, or even many worse ones, but I wonder what tech all the angry old men on Facebook and angry old women on Instagram think would be harder to bypass.\n\nThe biggest real cost is to small companies trying to set up new platforms, and while it’s not massive, it does cost money to integrate a responsible age verifier. Though it’s at best fractional compared to the bigger cost of per-request/GB cloud infrastructure (already 4-5x a dedicated server). It’s not like verification is going to be the sole factor stopping some fresh faced young business mogul from disrupting YouTube.\n\nIf you’re being forced to verify your age by any platform by providing a scan of your ID or your face (either through tech on their servers, or more commonly through a third-party plug-in), you can do that safely *IF* their verification provider guarantees that they do not keep your photo/video/id-scan stored at all. They do not need it except for at the instant of verification, when they can simply log a flag for your account. Compliant verifiers should be be able to make that claim and prove it.\n\nThe Persistent Failure of Steam’s Management\nThere are already really stupid/lazy implementations: Steam has decided “Your UK Steam user account is considered age verified for as long as a valid credit card is stored on the account.”, which is a moronic policy. I’ve never had a credit card on steam, and I’m pretty sure my account is 20+ years old as I’ve had it since Half Life 2 released.\n\nI know old folks who don’t have a credit card, and some poor folks too, so Steam really need to find a verification service provider and plug them into their system. They only age-gate 18+ rated games (so no sticky anime girls being pushed at kids), which obviously sucks if you’re over 18 and that’s your thing, but some of the creepy stuff Steam have on their platform since they lowered the gates already borders on illegal anyway. It turns out if you don’t moderate your storefront, the nazi-games and the creeps will use it for evil, and no amount of closing your eyes and pretending it isn’t happening is going to make them stop polluting your storefront.\n\nIt’s all good being a techbro neo-hippy until you’re taking 30% of the sale price of games that support steam users to spreading their monstrous SA or ethnic cleansing fantasies in groups on the platform, under the guise of being edgy.\n\nBusinesses gonna business\nSometimes when businesses make you jump through stupid hoops, like scrolling the billion things that could be in your mobile game loot-box, and having to click agree before you can open a free loot-box, or like when you have to click 15 checkboxes before you can close the cookie warning with a setting that isn’t ‘I agree to whatever’, they’re doing it like that on purpose, so you don’t actually take the time to use your rights (it’s called a dark pattern).\n\nSome businesses are doing the same with OSA now, they’re choosing the worst possible option for *you*, so *they* have to change as little as possible. The _point_ of the OSA is to make companies treat you better, not to exploit you and neglect their responsibilities to protect your kids from the hideous people prowling through their infrastructure, and if they won’t… you kinda have to choose to stop using them until they do.\n\nOther countries will be following this model too (probably not the US, but maybe), so you can see this as a pilot for now. They’re not going to undo it, and the decision-makers in the UK govt already think it’s gone pretty well, and that only the optics and the communications were a failure.\n\nI think in the light of patient consideration (and after reading far too many policy PDFs this week), I’ve come around on the OSA. It is a stupid law, but there wasn’t going to be a better one, so fuck it.\n\nTagged: #osa, #onlinesafetyact, #policy, #ukpolitics, #internet, #socialmedia, #privacy, #compliance, #law, #regulation, #platforms, #startups, #infrastructure, #cloud, #verification, #trustandsafety, #tech, #disruption, #steam, #online safety act\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nOne in a million\nI’ve got this spiritual principle I use for making complex decisions, where just for a moment, I choose to believe I’m “one in a million.”. Even if that’s only slightly true, there are over eight billion people in the world, so that means there are 8,000+ people out there just like me — who make every decision I make, the same way I make it.\n\nAside: as a programmer, I’ve spent decades in sweaty basements surrounded by mostly guys exactly like me. Many even called Bob, or Robert, or Rob too (and just so so many Daves and Steves I honestly lost count). I’m pretty sure I’ve already met a few of my statistical doppelgangers.\n\nAnd yeah, if you want to try to pick this apart with a neat little logical tree, don’t bother. It doesn’t work that way. It’s not always the same leaf on a branch whenever you check. It’s more like some quantum moral doppelgänger situation — a wave, not a particle ;p\n\nWhen you run the numbers, it gets oddly comforting. One in a million still works out to around 140 mes (and yous) born every year, and about 60 mes (and yous) breathing their last.\n\nI find that strangely reassuring. We’re all net positive together, and you really do, mathematically speaking, make the change you want to see in the world, just be choosing to do better.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: I even asked an AI if this idea already had a name. It couldn’t find one. Which is kind of funny, because if I’m one in a million, there should be 8000 of me thinking the same thing — but maybe the models just haven’t scraped one of them yet.\n\nTagged: #maths, #population, #thought experiment, #weird comfort, #quantum doppelganger, #one in a million, #ai, #generative ai\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nOn a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’ (AI tweaked version)\nThis is the AI edited version of my entirely handwritten post, On a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’. You can find reasoning for its changes at the end. I thought it might make an interesting contrast.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog. It’s generally gone well, but I want to raise some points…\n\nRewording Issues\nIt’s extremely aggressive when it comes to rewording. I often have to say “use my words” or “stick to my phrasing” three or four times before it stops turning whatever I said into mulch. In GPT-5’s latest 'quick’ mode (basically GPT-3) it’s extremely lazy, so statements like “really THINK about it” or just waiting for lower load times, when it’s more likely to use 'thinking’ mode, seem to help.\n\nGiving it my original text with each repeated imperative, or explaining why I said something in a particular way, can help. But there are things it just doesn’t like: run-on sentences (even those I use for rhythm, humour, or stress) often get chopped into nonsense, and intentional misuse of grammar… well, it really hates that.\n\nConnective Tissue\nIt does a decent job of 'connective tissue.’ If I write a skeet rant as a draft and copy it in, then after I’m done forcing it not to change my phrasing, it can turn it into a post with some flow. But I tend to think between the lines, and my earlier posts read more like 5–7 standalone paragraphs than one coherent piece.\n\nIt’s not as 'fun’ as writing alone, but sometimes useful. Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\n\nTone and Audience\nIt has a decent sense of tone. If I say “fucking terrible policy,” it usually knows I’m exaggerating for effect, but will almost always suggest toning it down. I don’t mind alienating readers: good-faith readers can work with their own emotions, and I’m not interested in writing for bad-faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\n\nEarlier posts on this blog show more empty, corpo-feeling language — back when I hadn’t yet learned how to force it to keep my words, but without the unintentional digs at readers that actually do make people switch off.\n\nResearch Value\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode), it’s invaluable — almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is too steep). You have to tell it to cite sources, specify what sources are acceptable (I avoid newspapers except as support), and enforce rules like “multiple claims can’t rely on one source.” The best sources are researchers, government agencies, universities, and primary datasets — not opinion pieces.\n\nChatGPT and Grok vary a lot. I prefer ChatGPT’s final output, but Grok is excellent for critique. I’ll often ask it for a second opinion with phrases like “tear the arsehole out of this blog post” or “severely criticise this claim, with evidence.”\n\nRed Flags\nA lot of people I’ve talked to (or watched using it) are aware of its limitations, but there are problems:\n\nPeople give their preferred LLM too much agency, lifting responses wholesale without really reading them.\nThey talk about the model as if it “understood” or “felt” things.\nThe press leaves a fog of “stupid” opinions about AI out in the wild, misrepresenting what it does and when to use it.\nNeurodivergence and Flow\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD). When I used to write directly into my dash, I’d often lose the plot halfway: either brain fog or rabbit-holing into tangents. I still do this, but the AI helps me check: “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? Are all the sections connected?” Sometimes it helps me split a messy article into two clearer ones.\n\nSpeed and Structure\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about quality. But it’s too eager to push you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response discourages sitting with a piece. My earlier posts are more like quick takes; now I prefer slower, deeper posts with sources.\n\nPraise and Phrasing\nChatGPT in particular loves to praise you. Even with project voice settings, it’s unavoidable. I once tried to cut the first and last paragraph of every response with a userscript, but the HTML made it unreliable. My workaround: ignore the fluff. The prompt should come from me, and the judgment of success should too. The more you let it take control, the further you drift from meaningful content.\n\nSwearing actually helps. If I swear at it, it follows instructions more closely and does more work. For one project, some of my logs (usually at high-load times) include things like: “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction], like I said, you dick…” It’s partly venting, partly effective. (And no, I would never speak to an actual colleague like that.)\n\nCommunity Use\nIn neurodivergent spaces, I see a lot of people using ChatGPT, sometimes well, sometimes poorly. It’s easy to spot when someone didn’t work their input enough. If you use a free/cheap model, don’t expect much. Even under Plus, GPT-3 and Claude have been lazy since Agent mode got mainstream. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs — not by criticising them for using the tool, but by showing what it does well and what it doesn’t.\n\nReactions to AI Writing\nSome people will dismiss any content they think is AI-written, even when it isn’t. On Reddit, I’ve seen the default retort: “AI slop, garbage opinion.” That’s just lazy. I wrote earlier about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people are writing like AI now — easy-reading rhythm, low-bar accessibility, short paragraphs.\n\nMy Current Use\nSo far, I’m happy using it for:\n\nTesting the strength of a claim\nSuggesting simpler phrasing for complex issues\nBut I’d avoid prompts like “Rewrite this in the style of X,” because it almost never delivers what I want.\n\nFinal Thought\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (I’ve already seen it pushed in corporates I know). But as a workflow tool — used carefully, only for what it’s good at — it’ll stay in my toolbox for now.\n\nEdits the AI made (in ChatGPT’s own words)\nHere’s the reasoning behind the minimal changes I made, stripped of the structural stuff (headings, spacing, etc.):\n\nClarified dense sentences: a few run-ons were split just enough to preserve rhythm without losing meaning (e.g. “mulch” instead of “much,” trimming the overstacked commas).\nRemoved duplicates/repetition: you circled back to some points (like praise-padding, rewording aggression, connective tissue) multiple times; I left them once, where they landed strongest.\nLight wording polish: fixed a couple of small slips that looked accidental rather than intentional (“mulch” vs “much,” “arshole” → “arsehole”), but left deliberate quirks intact.\nContext clues: added a single explanatory aside where an acronym (AuDHD) might throw readers unfamiliar with it.\nTone preservation: all the swearing, snark, and exaggeration stayed — I only smoothed where it risked confusing the point rather than sharpening it.\nThe AI version isn’t “nicer,” it’s just trimmed of redundancies and cleaned of unintentional noise, while leaving your intended noise (humour, rhythm, tangents) intact.\n\nMy 'take’\nThese changes are generally reasonable, except where it dropped a couple of entire points (probably to satisfy its word limiter), you may prefer one or the other, but I try to land somewhere in the middle. I don’t like how LLMs take off ALL the sharp edges, but that is definitely a utility I find useful sometimes.\n\nI’ve recently been using it to write in-depth research reports and important feedback and complaints (like to my GP, mentioned in an earlier blog post). Used as a tool, not a lifestyle, I’m comfortable endorsing AI more broadly, and hope with my upcoming project to highlight some of this value, especially in complex comms, to others in future.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai, #communication\nPosted 3 weeks ago with 1 note\nOn a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’\nThis is the entirely handwritten version of this post, you can read: On a few months of writing with an AI 'assistant’ (AI tweaked version) here.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog, there’s an old post about it down there somewhere. It’s generally gone well, but I want to raise some points…\n\nIt’s extremely aggressive when it comes to rewording. I often have to say “use my words” or “stick to my phrasing” three or four times, before it stops turning whatever I said into a mulch. In GPT-5’s latest 'quick’ mode (basically GPT-3) it’s extremely lazy, so currently statements like “really THINK about it” or just trying to avoid peak load times, when it’s more likely to use 'thinking’ mode helps.\nGiving it my original text with each repeated imperative, or explaining why I said something in a particular way can help, but there’s some stuff it just doesn’t like, run-on sentences (even those I use for rhythm, humour, or stress) often get split into two sentences that barely make sense, and intentional misuse of grammar, well… it, really hates, that, absolutely!!!!\nIt does a pretty good job of 'connective tissue’, like if I write a skeet rant as a draft, then copy that in; after I’m done telling it not to change my phrasing or words, it can turn it into a post that has _some_ sense of flow, but I tend to think between the lines, and you can just scroll down and see how earlier posts read more like 5-7 independent paragraphs than a coherent piece.\nIt’s not as 'fun’ as writing alone, but it does occasionally have useful suggestions. Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft… [draft]” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\nIt’s got a reasonable sense of tone, like it knows that if I say “fucking terrible policy” that I’m exaggerating to make a point, but does almost always suggest toning it down to avoid alienating readers. I don’t mind alienating readers, because a good faith reader can use their own emotions to continue digesting a piece, and I’m not interested in writing for bad faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\nIf you scroll down to the earlier posts on this 'blog’, you can see the emptier/corpo language, because I hadn’t learned how to make it say what I said, but without the problematic emotional states that actually do cause readers to check out (like unintentionally criticising the reader themselves).\nThe word-soup feeling diminishes as I added more of my existing articles and more content written directly by me to the project, and as I added more chats, especially because ChatGPT projects now correctly contextualise text files and chats on a project, including instructions.\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode) it’s really invaluable, almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is just a little too steep). You absolutely have to tell it to cite sources, which sources are acceptable (I generally advise no newspaper stories except as support), and how multiple claims shouldn’t rely on a single source, and how authoritative sources come from researchers, government agencies, universities and other primary datasets, not from opinion pieces (except where the research is looking for opinions).\nChatGPT and Grok vary wildly on specific subjects, and I tend to prefer the final output from ChatGPT, but Grok is very good at criticising content, so I’ll often ask it for a 'second opinion’, including phrases like 'tear the arsehole out of this blog post’ or 'severely criticise this claim, citing reasons with evidence’.\nI’ve talked with quite a few people (and seen some using it directly) about how they use these tools, and generally people (at least the people I know) are aware of the limitations and opportunities of these tools, but there are some red flags… a) People give their preferred LLM far too much agency, not only in how they parse and use responses (often just lifting content and barely even reading it before shipping it) but in how they express how the engine understood or felt about the issue. and b) The way the press cover it leaves a lot of 'stupid’ opinions about how AI works out in the wild… often massively misrepresenting what it can do and when to use it.\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD) so when I used to write in my own dash directly, I’d get half-way into an article and lose the plot completely… either through brain-fog, or just through rabbit-holing into a tangent (probably my most difficult-to-overcome behaviour). I still do this in the posts I’m writing myself, but it does come in handy when I’m done writing to ask something like “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? are all the sections connected?” and it’s occasionally helped me take a single piece that gets lost in the middle, and turn that into 2 pieces that each have a little less to say, but better capture and communicate the subject.\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about the quality of results, but it’s really eager to get you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response really discourages chewing over a piece, and my earlier posts demonstrate that. They’re basically just 'takes’, and while I don’t mind posting a take here or there, I prefer the depth of the longer form posts with various supporting citations.\nI also wrote about how ChatGPT in particular loves to celebrate you, give you a pat on the back for being such a smart boy… I’ve tried to mitigate that by setting my project voice, but it’s basically unavoidable. I even tried writing a userscript that cuts off the first and last paragraph of every response, but finding the right HTML elements proved impossible to do reliably. Just don’t read the first and last paragraph of any response from any model, use your old-school banner-blindness. The prompt should always be coming from you, and what you thought about how well it did what you asked for. Every time you let it take control, you can only get further away from valuable/meaningful content.\nSwearing actually fucking helps. When you swear at the engine, it takes your instructions more seriously, makes it slightly less lazy, and aside from the word “THINK” under GPT-5, is one of the few ways to get it to do more real work, and more closely follow what you told it to do. For my main current project, some of my chat logs (mostly from high-load times like Saturday morning) say things like “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction] , like I said, you dick… [claim]”, partly cos it feels good to vent, and it’s a computer so who cares (I would not speak to a human like this, and never ever have. I worked with a guy who did early in my career and he indirectly taught me that’s a terrible way to work, even for a hardcore utilitarian), but also because it really does do a better job in the response.\nThere’s mixed positions on please and thank you. The platforms would rather you didn’t (it does cost them for every response, they’d prefer you to be utilitarian), but realistically the cost is minimal, and when it’s delivering well, it makes _me_ feel better to treat it like a co-writer I respect, so I tend to communicate with it in much the same way I did when I hired freelancers (basically it ate their job, as I no longer have a virtual assistant to pickup my more mundane tasks).\nI’ve noticed a lot of other people in generally 'neurodivergent’ (man, I hate that term, for its 'othering’) spaces using ChatGPT especially, some more than others, and while many are getting real value from being able to construct and analyse complex thoughts with relatively low effort; it’s easy to see when some people didn’t really work their input enough. If you use a cheap/free model, do NOT expect good results. Even under Plus, GPT3 and Claude have been particularly stupid/lazy since the rise of Agent mode on mainstream platforms. It’s no wonder OpenAI decided to just mash their models together under a marshall and call it GPT-5. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs when you see it, not by criticising them for using the tool but by helping them understand what it does well and what it doesn’t.\nMy last major point, is some people will be triggered by any form of AI writing, even if it’s not writing output by an AI. I noticed this especially on reddit, a common retort, even for non-AI based content is something like “low quality AI slop is just a garbage opinion”, but I think that’s just a lazy go-to, as I think one of my earlier posts was about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people started writing like AI for real, because aside from the hypnotic rhythm of its paragraphs, it generally writes text that is easy to digest, especially if you set a lower reading ease.\nOn progress so far, I’m pretty happy with my general use of it in use cases like “Test the strength of this claim” or “Suggest some ways to express this complex issue in plain English”, but I’d probably avoid in future just saying “Rewrite this in the style of these”, because it rarely just gives you what you actually want.\n\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (as I’ve already seen it being pushed on corpos I know), but as a general quality and workflow tool, used only for what it’s good at, it’ll stay in my toolbox for a while.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nJournalists making rage, not change\nThis barely researched news story landed on the r/manchester reddit from the guardian yesterday: English councils pay private landlords millions in incentives to house homeless families\n\nimage\nStories like this with no sense of scale always leave me wondering what they _really_ mean, beyond being clickbait, so I looked into it…\n\nFor scope… I’m primarily interested in Manchester (I live here, and they have many more occurences than any other listed region), only in other regions insofar as they compare to Manchester.\n\nI went to the source (Generation Rent) and opened up their data on a computer (since the xlsx-html hide column headers on mobile), switched to the real xlsx and got the headings “Council - Occasions paid an incentive - £ paid in incentives - Highest incentive (£)”. This gives us an average £2958 per ‘occasion paid an incentive’.\n\nWith a max payment of £5980, suggesting a fairly low spread, but can’t find info on exactly who was paid what or when, so 90% of those could have gone to single landlord (unlikely, but possible) over 1138 'occasions’ (best guess, that’s 1138 people or families homed by a landlord who otherwise wouldn’t have let to them because of uncertainty).\n\nFor comparison, the total fund would buy 13-14 'average’ Manchester houses, to bring back into public ownership, or could maybe build 15-20 new houses owned publicly from scratch.\n\nI also put together a 'rough’ estimate of distribution based on reported figures just to inform context.\n\nFor total cost per resident, in Manchester, that’s about £6 each, or ~0.3% of council tax bill funded these incentives. This is slightly less than Enfield (the highest), about the same as Ealing, a little more than Nottingham, and substantially more than Birmingham (£1.45 tho I think that has a larger rural/suburban catchment area where these don’t really apply). London is around £5 per resident.\n\nThe original FOI for Manchester from Generation Rent is here. The wording suggests those occasions paid for 1131 people/families to be homed, but it is unclear about the details, I suspect it would need more FOIs to clarify.\n\n[imo] that seems mostly reasonable to me, but the total spend does support Generation Rent’s case that councils need more tools to use, 0.3% of total council tax paid isn’t nothing, but it’s not a 'tear down the council’ or 'eat all private landlords’ scale problem. Even if a small proportion of the 1000+ people or families are not sleeping on the streets, that’s a pretty good way to spend council money to avoid having to setup a thunderdome :)\n\nAs an unrelated aside, whenever you see “£X MILLIONS” in a headline… if the body of the article doesn’t contain some kind of per-capita or per-subject breakdown, that’s a journalistic failure, usually with the side-effect of creating outrage instead of communicating meaning. The Guardian used to be better than this, cos this type of headline especially belongs in a tabloid, not a real newspaper. Real data makes for real positive outcomes.\n\nWhy does this matter? Surely it’s just a nitpick? What does it matter if the scale isn’t reported? It’s still £3.35m, right?\nIt’s a fairly easy scale to identify, how many people did this money help home? Now we have at least a vague idea.\nIt also helps us identify what other solutions this could afford, and whether they would beat the current outcomes.\nIf you already got 'all the facts’ (or as many as you can), even if the facts don’t support your desired outcomes quite as enthusiastically as you’d prefer, you still have a case that’s harder to tear down or ignore.\nIt prevents readers lazily skipping to conclusions like “ban all private landlords” or “stop the council spending this money”, that make them feel better about complaining, but would harm real home-seekers if the council suddenly had to stop incentivising, but the actual proposal by Generation Rent was not actioned. If you solved the loud problem and not the quiet one, you just made a bigger problem for everybody.\nIt prevents (or at least discourages) 'ragers’ taking up all the oxygen, like on our original reference, the reddit thread. You can find this story in other city subreddits, and I expect on facebook too, with the same kneejerk reactions at various intensities. Placing the problem in context is crucial, or people will take whatever they want from your data, and you will have no way to stop them misrepresenting your objective or the positive outcomes.\nIt’s the right thing to do, even if it makes me look like a dick for nitpicking on bluesky :)\nTagged: #manchester, #council, #guardian, #journalistic malpractice, #ragebait, #clickbait, #journalism, #lazy, #renters, #council tax, #manchester city council\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nAI commercials don’t think you’re dumb, they’re just lying, legally\nAI ads are weird. Every time you see one, it’s an unimaginably low-stakes scenario: “learn some football bants”, “summarise an email”, “identify this fish”, “help me write a cute little note”. Exchanges so meaningless and empty, you wouldn’t even think to ask them.\n\nNobody actually uses gen AI like that, and everyone knows it, including the advertisers and platform decision-makers. People make fun of them as if the agencies are just clueless, like they genuinely believe the killer app for generative AI is party small talk. But that’s not what’s happening…\n\nThey can’t say what you actually use AI for. They can’t suggest “ask it about your mental health” or “do deep research on why my state just made this new draconian law” or “how do I expand my small business?” or even “how do I answer this email without sounding like a dickhead” and “my partner does this annoying thing, how do I deal with it?” (all common and well-recorded use cases, no moral judgment intended), because the moment they do, they open the entire organisation up to legal action. Visit the subreddit for basically any neurodiversity or mental-health issue, and you’ll find post after post of people using ChatGPT to deal with their problems, or just to feel better after a hard day, often with positive results. The corpos selling these genuinely useful services can’t focus on those though, because that comes with far more baggage than the organisation is willing to carry.\n\nHere are some examples: Google’s Gemini Super Bowl run with “Dream Job” and “Party Blitz” (The Verge, Google blog), Microsoft’s Copilot “Your everyday AI companion” Super Bowl ad and its “conversation starters” demos (CBS News, YouTube), Meta’s Ray-Ban Meta glasses Super Bowl campaign with Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt and the cringey “Parent Presentation” spot they pulled almost instantly (Meta, People, TidBITS, The Verge, Business Insider), OpenAI’s “The Intelligence Age” Super Bowl debut (OpenAI, Adweek, The Verge), and Anthropic’s five-second Claude bumper during the 2024 game (Axios).\n\nAI companies like to pretend that their biggest problem is “sometimes our responses contain innaccurate or out of date information”, and hedge/disclaim that right next to the main input textbox, and that’s generally what the press and outrage crowds tend to focus on how the AI can’t generate an accurate diagram of the female reproductive system, for example, but the real potential for harm of AI comes from when it technically can deliver information, but perhaps it shouldn’t, or even if it should, it’s still trusting you, the meatspace-based human, to action or implement based on its information reasonably, and not get mad (or litigious) if it all goes wrong.\n\nAn LLM can tell you to eat rocks, and that’s obviously stupid, but if it tells you to swallow your feelings and get on with your depressing job (even if it hedges a little), or you ask it about something uncomplicated, and its pursuit of balance or of avoiding being contentious/edgy responds with some advice that sounds good but isn’t if you think about it (because it’s trained largely on reddit/quora/etc which are full of terrible advice of their own forms), that’s an output of the system the organisation becomes liable for. So ads just pick the lowest possible stakes and pretend that’s all you’d ever use it for. If you use it for something else, that’s entirely on you.\n\nAI commercials don’t think you’re stupid, their internal data definitely shows them clearly what users are asking for, and if anything I suspect whoever at the marketing agency who puts these things out has said “people know what AI can actually do, they know these things would never happen like this” in a quiet meeting. I’d even bet the lawyers signing off on these ads know exactly what they’re doing, but as long as nobody admits it, there’s an entire system of legal defense that just keeps comfortably rolling along, trying to find new ways of taking your money by providing an always-on ‘e-friend’ who solves all your problems.\n\nTagged: #ai, #ads, #generative ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #gemini, #meta ai, #apple intelligence, #commercials, #marketing, #liability, #lawsuits, #bullshit, #lonliness, #lonely, #mental health\nPosted 4 weeks ago\nEveryone’s Wrong About How AI Works (Including Me)\nSo many people are so confidently wrong about how AI works that it actually makes me more confident the models’ own confidently-wrong output is based on real human input. They’re just reflecting us back at ourselves — smug mistakes in, smug mistakes out.\n\nAnd yeah, I’m in that pool too. I’ll happily waffle on about prompt clarity and outputs under load, and I’m happy to point and laugh at the vagina museum confidently claiming “That’s how LLMs work” in the middle of a thirty or forty tweet thread where every single post is weighed down with their own hallucinations and imaginative explanations with absolutely no connection to reality, because while everyone loves the vagina museum enough for tens of thousands of people to retweet and like their nonsense, literally nobody in their audience has any real idea how the tech works beyond ‘magic box that obviously can’t draw the female reproductive system’, because of course it can’t, that’s not what it’s for.\n\nI like to think (in a lazy crutch kind of way) of LLMs like a bag of scrabble tiles, and especially with images, you tip out the pieces and get mad that it doesn’t spell antidisestablishmentarianism, cos you’re pretty sure you put all the letters in.\n\nSometimes I think the most plausible explanation is that LLMs are just portals into some parallel dimension where an infinite sweatshop of overworked gig-econony ghostwriters are cranking out all our mediocre replies in some frozen time-space continuum. Honestly, if we discovered that tomorrow, nobody would even blink — it’d feel about right cos that’s how we build everything already anyway.\n\nAnd if we’re all going to be confidently wrong, maybe I should just choose to believe the whole thing runs on a single haunted qubit forming an einstein-rosen bridge in a basement somewhere. At least that’s a fun lie, and it’s not much more ridiculous than the reality of gazillions of grains of sand computing probability tables until they hit boundary conditions that collapse into a picture of a lizard lady with three tits or a screed about how AI works.\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #generativeai, #confidentlywrong, #altreality, #shitpost, #techhumour, #dead internet, #vibes, #rant, #skeets, #lol\nPosted 4 weeks ago\nOn the joy of being a bit of a dick to solve problems\nHad a couple of good work days, had a few projects come together into a cohesive set, and discovered I’m a pretty competent script-writer when I take the time to do a proper job — and the icing on the cake… My neighbour just told me she’s finally getting rid of her fucking cockerel. \\o/ [coming up Milhouse dot gif]\n\nAs a bonus: after weeks on a strict diet of mostly potatoes and bean mash, I’ve got snacks again 🤤\n\nAt the start of the year I promised myself I’d stop ignoring the little things that make life worse.

Nothing massive, but just trying to solve these things is starting to pay off and my internal “am I being a dick?” counter has barely ticked up.\n\nIf I have any advice for tackling problems that aren’t your fault (those are a bit harder) it’s this: show people the evidence. A simple graph or log can make it obvious who the real dickhead is, and that’s harder to argue with than just venting.\n\nThe next project is pulling together GP practice reviews across a dozen sites run by the same management company, and comparing them to their competitors.

On a good day, with low load, it’s barely distinguishable from magic. It sucks because its incredible power is so easy for people to use against you. All the stuff you’ve left online — the posts, the scraps, the off-hand comments — that’s ammo. And nobody else is going to clean it up. You have to.\n\nIf you’ve got any kind of digital footprint, try it. Open any LLM in a private chat, switch memory/history off, and just ask it about you. That’s the surface-level stuff it already knows. But if you really want to see what it can do, gather your posts like a scammer would, feed them in, and ask it to make assumptions. What do I like? What am I insecure about? What would I fall for? It doesn’t take much.\n\nChatGPT used to try and block this. It would stall or redirect. But since Grok launched, the guardrails have thinned out, and you can do it on either one now. The system message technically says “no personal data about anyone unless it’s public and relevant.” But that’s not an and, it’s an or. Make it public, or argue it’s relevant, and the model plays along. Strip out names, call it fiction, drop in a fake world — it still works. Those rules don’t protect you. They protect the platform’s lawyers.\n\nThis isn’t new either. The same advice applied back in 2011. I built a system for a major media org that scraped and connected data about their users and their families the old-fashioned way. We called it “the Facebook you don’t know you’re part of,” and eventually convinced management to kill it. For scope: the whole point was to sell cars to the wealthiest identifiable member of any household, based on their share history and a handful of behavioural assumptions. Off six or seven data points, it got the hierarchy right about ninety percent of the time. You are leaky.\n\nAnd here’s the thing: our system didn’t even need social media, and it only took a few devs a few months to build. Then one day we added a small feature that suddenly made it so invasive we all just looked at each other and realised we couldn’t ship it. Because the org wasn’t evil, management agreed. It was disturbingly easy to build, and could have been a secret nightmare. I still remember the look on one manager’s face when we explained it — we made it sound difficult and expensive, but he was excited anyway. Most of the rest were horrified. Luckily there were too many layers of management to ship it then, but plenty of others in companies all over the world picked up the baton and sprinted full pelt until they couldn’t sprint any faster… then they needed more, and now we have LLMs.\n\nI haven’t tried (yet), but I reckon with the right phrasing to avoid the weak guardrails (pretend you only want to build it about yourself maybe), you could ask Grok to recreate the whole thing today. And it’d probably do a decent job on the very first try — especially if you had a specific target in mind.\n\nSo yeah. The tech works. It’s almost magic when it isn’t under load. That’s the problem though, if you don’t clean up your trail, the techbros are going to ingest it (if they haven’t already) and it’s going to follow you, because your info is being worked into the models beneath the models (GPT-5 already layering on top of old models, and as above, so below, you’re stuffed in the catacombs). It’s not like google search where you can just file a request to have your database row deleted, there’s no getting it out, what you have online today is what you’ll be known for, forever.\n\nGPT-5 system messages, ish\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #grok, #chatgpt, #privacy, #dead internet, #data, #safety, #tech rant, #generative ai, #communication, #genai, #politics, #personal data\nPosted 4 weeks ago with 3 notes\nNobody at YouTube Watches YouTube\nI know this because of something so stupid it borders on parody. The YouTube TV app — which is basically the same web client everywhere now — still doesn’t remember if you want subtitles on. Every single time you open it, or even when it nudges you to re-select your profile after being idle, you have to go dig into menus, find the CC toggle they’ve buried deeper with each redesign, and turn captions back on.\n\nIn 2025, in homes where kids are running around, people are multitasking, and half the viewing is with the volume down, subtitles aren’t an “edge case.” They’re baseline. They’re also not just about convenience — they’re about accessibility. If you’re hard of hearing, you literally can’t use the app properly without turning CC on every time. That’s not a quirk. That’s a broken product.\n\nAnd it’s not like this hasn’t been raised. Hard-of-hearing communities have been complaining to deaf ears (lol) for years. Anyone who watches TV with captions would notice in about thirty seconds. There are at least thirty or forty real people in the YouTube product and design chain who could have caught this, flagged it, or fixed it with probably a single line of code. Instead, it’s been ignored, and in their latest “big refresh” they somehow made it worse.\n\nWhich leads me back to the claim. If even one decision-maker at YouTube — from the lowest PM to the highest-paid boardroom executive — actually relied on captions at home, this wouldn’t still be a problem. The only plausible explanation is that none of them do. That’s the only way something this obvious survives multiple product cycles.\n\nAnd that’s what really gets me. As a designer, it’s not just annoying — it’s insulting. It’s a reminder that the platform with a monopoly on so much creative culture is run by people who don’t use it the way most of us do. The people making the calls aren’t living with the same pain points, so those problems never get solved. They’re invisible at the top, glaring everywhere else.\n\nAnd sure — in the grand scheme of YouTube’s endless list of backwards decisions and neglected features, this is a small one. But it’s also telling. If they can’t be bothered to fix the basics, what chance is there they’ll tackle the bigger failures?\n\nSomeone really does need to disrupt YouTube.\n\nTagged: #youtube, #design, #accessibility, #enshittification, #subtitles, #rant, #deafawareness, #deafculture, #hard of hearing\nPosted 1 month ago\nCrypto Seems Stupid, But It Solves a Problem (Just Probably Not for You, Yet)\nCrypto as an industry is stupid. Let’s get that out of the way. It’s a clown car of scams, cult vibes, and half-baked libertarian fantasies about freedom without responsibility. It is, in the broadest sense, ridiculous.\n\nBut here’s the awkward bit: it actually does solve a problem. Just not your problem. At least, not yet.\n\nThe Problem Nobody Wants to Admit\nThe money layer of the internet isn’t neutral. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal — these aren’t just pipes you can pour payments through. They’re gatekeepers, and they know it. They’ve cut off porn platforms. They’ve throttled sex educators. They’ve quietly shut down queer creators, kink communities, even writers who looked too adjacent to the “wrong” politics.\n\nAnd now it’s games too — recent reporting shows Steam and Itch have both been pressured by payment processors (last I read, they denied it). Even entirely normal hustles and small creators get hit, sometimes just for TOS violations or false flags. People lose their income overnight, with no recourse, because some fringe product or anonymous report tripped a system designed to protect the most powerful customers, not the real people using it.\n\nWhy Crypto Looks Like the Wrong Answer\nCrypto has earned its reputation. Scams, pump-and-dumps, rug-pulls, and plenty of users who talk like failed cult leaders. It’s been lumped in with the dark web since the start. While it does enable shady stuff, it doesn’t have to enable only that.\n\nAnd despite the myths, most crypto isn’t really anonymous; they’re pseudonymous. Every transaction is public, forever. If investigators already have a thread, they can pull it.\n\nThen there’s the energy debate. Proof-of-work mining is wasteful, sure — but newer tokens don’t drink the ocean. Even with the worst offenders, the problem often comes down to bad infrastructure and perverse incentives. Companies like Nvidia have no reason to reinvent chips when the old ones sell fine. The system rewards inefficiency because that’s what pays.\n\n…But It Does Fix This One\nHere’s the rub: if you’re a sex worker suddenly cut off from payment processors, or a queer creator flagged as “brand unsafe,” or someone whose platform got kneecapped because Stripe panicked about “reputational risk,” crypto might be your only option left standing.\n\nStablecoins in particular are boring, which is exactly what you want from money. They let people send and receive without begging permission from a boardroom of executives who’ve never heard of you and wouldn’t admit they canceled you even if you asked. Yes, the current US administration is fumbling regulation in a way that makes stablecoins look like just another scam coin. But some form of responsible regulation would be welcome — and overdue.\n\nAnd you don’t have to use Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or whatever fresh coin the nerds are yelling about this week (hint, it’s 99.9% probably a scamcoin if it’s come out in the last few years). As long as everyone involved agrees it’s pretty stable, or you’re in and out quickly (or comfortable holding volatility in your pocket), any token will do. The nerds deserve mockery for their blind optimism, but they’re not entirely wrong that used responsibly, it has value.\n\nThe “Yet”\nMaybe that’s not your problem. Maybe you’ve got a regular job, a respectable bank account, and no reason to worry about whether your income stream will vanish overnight because some corpo compliance reviewer didn’t like the shape of your business.\n\nBut the choke point isn’t theoretical. It’s already here. Entire groups are being financially deplatformed right now. Maybe you don’t need crypto — until suddenly you do.\n\nPay Attention\nNobody’s asking you to jump in with both feet. But understand what it actually is because maybe one day you’ll need it — or maybe a creator you like will get cut off, and you’ll want a way to slip them some support.\n\nThis matters more as platforms corporate-ize. YouTube, Twitch, Patreon — all of them focus on fewer, bigger players once the VC money takes the reins. It happened in microstock: the floor kept rising until most contributors were shoved into the basement to fight over scraps.\n\nCrypto isn’t utopia. It won’t buy you coffee at Starbucks anytime soon (or at least not outside of the valley). But for all its absurdity, it’s one of the very few escape hatches left in a financial system that wants everything channeled between two high walls, sterile and market-ready, like pigs driven to slaughter.\n\nYou don’t have to like it. You don’t even have to use it. But it already exists, and it already works. It costs you basically nothing to understand the option — and you might be glad you did.\n\nTagged: #crypto, #cryptocurrency, #bitcoin, #ethereum, #stablecoins, #fintech, #financial censorship, #deplatformed, #payment processors, #mutual aid, #swers, #sexwork, #queer creators, #adult content, #censorship, #platform politics, #compliance capitalism, #tech rant\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhy you should use AI for art\nGen AI’s uptake has been wild, even though it’s far from a perfect tool. It’s already fucked over a million or more commercial artists worldwide by swamping every once-viable digital content market with slop. And it’s not just because the tools are bad—most “hustlers” trying to make hay while the sun shines (think markets like KDP, POD, or microstock, though the last one’s less “swamped” and more out-competed by free crappy images of whatever you can imagine) haven’t really reacted to the influx yet.\n\nMy main issue isn’t with AI adoption overall. I think it’s been over-adopted long before it’s actually good, but it is already occasionally useful when deployed in the right places and the right ways—as a tool that multiplies force, not as a worker replacement.\n\nThe problem’s with the irresponsible adoption: platforms that can’t tell the difference between slop and real value, and the absence of systems to determine that, because they’re too busy trying to leverage gen AI themselves, and not busy enough preventing exploitation by it. Eventually, those platforms will have to catch up or die.\n\nThere’s an argument about gen AI where it doesn’t belong, like spewing bullshit onto social media. But the biggest problem isn’t that they “stole” literally every image they could find to build the systems in the first place—regulators are now letting them get away with it, because it technically doesn’t violate copyright.\n\nCopyright’s on the exact words you used, not the style of words you tend toward; on the exact brush strokes, not your general use of phthalo blue (or however you spell it) and a palette knife. Likewise, intellectual property is the names and places in your world, not that you tend to set scenes in space with a big-titted lizard lady and a talking cat. People got mad at something nobody saw coming, so it’s not surprising there weren’t really any tools to stop it.\n\nAnyway, onto my story.\nThe short version: once upon a time, I was a microstock photographer and illustrator (a mediocre one, that’s fine, not everybody has to be Picasso). Eventually, loosely a video-illustrator of sorts (shaders to video). Going into around 2016 with somewhere near 10,000 pieces of content in my portfolio—not exactly earning a strong living, but earning enough to have been worth the time to make them. Well, microstock fell off a cliff (at least for me and everyone except the top 3% of producers) as the market consolidated (I won’t get into microstock history, but it was once a thriving industry). The better producers out-competed me (fairly), the agencies hoovered up or destroyed each other, and Unsplash and co came along and took the edge cases and convenience users, dropping my income to 20% of the peak. Even after adding 15,000 videos or so to my portfolio, that started okay, then dipped too as the agencies who ingested it struggled to keep them relevant or I got outcompeted in their algorithms.\n\nSo I shifted into print on demand. I lost track of how many designs in my portfolios years ago, but I’m pretty sure it’s at least half a million overall, maybe more—I honestly have no idea. My designs are basic, but I made them all myself, with the aid of scripts and tools I built, and put in the legwork to tag them and upload them. They paid a little… until gen AI came along (what, like 2021?) and bam, all of a sudden print on demand wasn’t viable cos every store—Cafepress, Teepublic, Redbubble, Spreadshirt, Zazzle, and I’m sure half a dozen I’ve forgotten—all got swamped by pretty poor quality, but technically passable free upsized Stable Diffusion characters with too many fingers and not enough characters in the text. But customers aren’t that bothered if all they want is a mug that says “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my morning cock” for less than twenty bucks. So POD dropped to 10% of its peak too (maybe less by now, I don’t bother to check anymore)…\n\nI actively encourage artists, especially those who once earned a real living, to use whatever AI tools they want or need to—to make up for their loss in sales, to leverage for more work, for happier clients, for faster throughput. Because commercial art isn’t always about being the best; it’s often just about getting enough work done in each new day to keep the lights on and the Photoshop subscription paid (I’ll cover this another day).\n\nWhen these whining kids on social media get triggered by a lazy article that has a “not just x, but y” conceit or an image of Sonic with too many fingers (does Sonic even have fingers?), because they feel like it stole their furry fan art from those 2 images they were proud of posting on Tumblr 10 years ago, I don’t give a fuck…\n\nThe entire market for commercial art got wiped out time and time again, and people have been stealing my images on the internet this entire millennium, and I never complained about it because that’s what the internet is. It’s stealing the Sonic IP so you can have him kissing a real girl in your lazy fanfic if you want to. And getting triggered at regular people just discovering the joy of creation for the first time—because they weren’t raised with enough time or energy to get into making their own work when they were entitled kids…\n\nI say let them make whatever trash they want with AI, let Disney cram it into every corner they want to, and I’ll gladly look at and maybe even enjoy it, because art isn’t just the execution, art is the idea\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #aiuptake, #commercialart, #microstock, #pod, #kdp, #artists, #slop, #hustlers, #platforms, #copyright, #generative ai, #disney, #ai, #business, #commercial, #stock photography\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhy is everyone so mad about asylum hotels?\nI didn’t understand this issue very well, so I did a deep dive, and here’s what I learned…\n\nIf you’ve read the headlines lately, you’d think local councils are writing cheques to Premier Inn and Travelodge for thousands of asylum seekers. That’s not actually true — but the reality is messier, and that’s why everyone’s shouting past each other.\n\nWho really pays for hotels?\nThe hotel contracts are signed and paid for by the Home Office — not your local council. The National Audit Office (NAO) sets this out clearly in its work on the Home Office’s asylum accommodation contracts (NAO briefing, May 2025). In 2023/24, the Home Office expected to spend £4.7bn on asylum support, including £3.1bn on hotels (NAO report, Mar 2024). In 2024/25, hotel spending ran at about £108m per month — roughly £1.3bn for the year (Reuters fact check, Jun 2025; see also NAO, May 2025).\n\nSo why are councils angry?\nBecause while they don’t pay the hotel bill, they do pay for everything that comes with it:\n\nSchools and childcare, safeguarding and social care.\nHousing and homelessness support when people leave hotels — whether granted status or evicted.\nLocal services like waste collection, environmental health and community safety.\nThe Local Government Association says councils receive no funding for hotels and want the same per‑bed support that exists for other accommodation types (LGA briefing, May 2024). Case in point: Hillingdon reports a £5m annual pressure linked to supporting people leaving hotels, with a cumulative shortfall over £16m (Hillingdon Council, Jul 2025). Glasgow forecast £26.5m of asylum‑related costs in 2024/25 (Glasgow City HSCP paper, Jan 2025).\n\nThis all lands after a decade of squeezed local budgets. Independent analysis shows core local government spending remains below 2010/11 in real terms (Institute for Government, Jul 2024; see also NAO, Feb 2025).\n\nWhy did the central bill drop?\nNot because the Home Office suddenly got efficient. The drop is mainly from using fewer hotels, packing more people into remaining sites, and shifting to cheaper options like large sites or other accommodation models. The NAO documents hotel closures and plans to reduce reliance on them (NAO report, Mar 2024). The Migration Observatory estimates hotel accommodation averaged about £170 per person per night in 2024/25 — far more than other options (Migration Observatory, Aug 2025). The House of Commons Library explains the policy shift to barges and large sites to cut hotel use (Commons Library, Jul 2023).\n\nWhy are councils going to court now?\nRecent legal challenges (like the Epping case) argue hotels can’t be repurposed this way without planning permission. That’s about where hotels are used, not ending hotel use everywhere. After the High Court ruling, the government said it would appeal and manage closures “in an orderly way” (Reuters, Aug 2025; also Guardian, Aug 2025).\n\nDo councils get any central funding at all?\nYes, but it’s fragmented and often doesn’t match actual local costs. Examples include the Asylum Dispersal Grant and Move On Grant funding instructions to local authorities (GOV.UK Dispersal Grant 2025–26; GOV.UK Move On Grant, Mar 2025). The LGA continues to push for proper funding tied to the pressures councils face (LGA campaign explainer).\n\nWhy “Stop the Boats” is such a stupid slogan\n“Stop the Boats” sounds simple, but it’s an undeliverable demand. Britain has no jurisdiction over where the boats set off from, no control over the wars, persecution, or other disasters that push people onto them, and no runway left in the countries of origin after decades of bombing, interventions, and half‑baked foreign policy. You can’t stop people fleeing danger with a soundbite.\n\nThat’s why it works politically: it’s a perfect wedge issue. It promises a solution that can’t be delivered, so whichever government fails can be painted as weak, and whichever opportunist shouts loudest can look like a saviour. Even if they took power, they’d be in the same situation — the only policies left would be cruel, extreme, and harmful to everyone involved.\n\nA better approach would be the opposite: quicker and fairer asylum decisions, investment in schools, health centres and libraries to support both new arrivals and existing residents, and proper public spending that strengthens communities. Building capacity is a force multiplier. It helps everyone.\n\nSo who’s really footing the bill?\nAll of us. The Home Office still spends billions centrally on hotels and asylum support (see NAO above). Councils then pay for the knock‑on local costs — with some grants, but large gaps remaining. That means council tax rises and service cuts are still on the table in many areas (IFS, Jun 2024; Commons Library, Jul 2025). The numbers move around, but the bill never disappears.\n\nImmigration isn’t the root of all our problems though, it’s barely even visible in the budget.\n\nimage\nPeople are angry… Some are angry for stupid racist reasons, some because they just don’t want to hear foreign on the bus or are terrified of muslims after decades of demonisation, some because their councils are broke and the general sense of social rot is spreading, and some because the whole thing feels like a giant shell game where the poorest communities always end up carrying the weight.\n\nThe overall cost just isn’t that much compared to the many many other problems that its convenient for the halls of power to pretend aren’t there, because most people have never seen what the budget really looks like, so of course they’re going to be easier to deal with if they’re not complaining about real problems, but instead complaining about problems you could fix for the cost of a couple of hospitality villages if you really wanted it to go away.\n\nThis Labour government seems unable to raise taxes in the places that would raise funds, won’t means-test the largest expenditures (like the pension, even though it could save £25 billion for a cost of less than half a billion), won’t pursue tech companies or multinationals who export wealth, won’t push any policies that might stunt ‘growth’ (despite there being little to no evidence for it), and have no power to establish new exports as more money leaves local economies than flow into them, but let’s not make this about Brexit ;)\n\nThe short version is, immigrants of any kind are not a big line item in anyone’s budget, the costs are tiny in reality, but they’re an easy target, vulnerable, visible, and all the answers are way more complicated than they seem if all you hear/read are soundbites from Farage and his fellow opportunists, or headlines from any news source that has an interest in pretending it’s simple so they can offer the most appealing answers.\n\nTagged: #asylum, #immigration, #refugees, #stoptheboats, #ukpolitics, #councils, #austerity, #racism, #publicservices, #housingcrisis, #shellgame, #wedgepolitics, #community, #stop the boats, #britain\nPosted 1 month ago\nCancel Culture has never cancelled anyone*\nCancel culture doesn’t exist. Not in the way people swear blind it does. You don’t get erased. You don’t vanish. You get a headline, a timeout, then a new gig.\n\nMel Gibson snarled his way back to Oscar nods, Johnny Depp waltzed into Cannes, James Franco slipped into European indies, Louis C.K. bagged a Grammy, Aziz Ansari shrugged it off with a Netflix drop, Shane Gillis went from SNL fired to SNL host, Gina Carano swapped Disney for Christian schlock, Kevin Hart kept the stadiums, Nick Cannon strolled back into Viacom, Roseanne Barr toured, Kanye West sold out again, Morgan Wallen topped charts, Marilyn Manson booked a tour, Shia LaBeouf turned up in Coppola’s Megalopolis, Dave Chappelle never even sat down long enough to notice. Cancelled? No. Just briefly inconvenienced.\n\nThe only real rule: if you’re in prison, you’re off the board. Weinstein, R. Kelly, Danny Masterson — yeah, you’re not back, yet.\n\n*And then the tiny minority that make up our asterisk. The ones who aren’t inside but still didn’t claw back a platform. Bill Cosby, free but radioactive. Michael Richards, one racist meltdown and done, for now. Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, out of the anchor chair with nowhere else to go.\n\nAnd then there’s Martha Stewart, the exception to the exception. She did the time, five months for insider trading, came out and played it like a badge of honour — prison as a rebrand. Her career was already fading, the jail stint shot it full of life, and she’s been riding that wave ever since, cooking shows and memes and a Snoop Dogg side-hustle that made her cooler than she ever was before.\n\nEveryone else? Cancellation is just another visibility bump. A career pivot. A rebrand. The “left” pretend it’s justice, the “right” scream it’s exile — but look around. The bellends in question faced no real consequence beyond a sabbatical followed by another paycheck. To actually stay cancelled you’ve got to be properly heinous, AND an utter prick to work with.

The things that make life worse for people here every single day. Instead the noise is all about “stop the boats.”, despite immigration costs being barely 2%-3% (much less, like way below 1% if you only consider ‘illegals’ or 'irregular migration’ if you prefer corpo-speak) of the budget.\n\nThe flag-shaggers terrorising immigrants in this city aren’t helping — they’re making everything worse. We can’t do anything about the boats, we don’t control where they come from. And yeah, asylum needs fixing — but it should be funded centrally, not dumped on local councils that can’t even fix a pothole after years of Tory cuts. And it sure as hell shouldn’t be public money lining hotel chains’ pockets to lock vulnerable people up like prisoners.\n\nThe whole thing is just a wedge issue. A distraction. Designed to keep people snapping at each other while the real enemies — the corporate interests and wealth hoarders — strip this city bare and laugh at us for falling for it.\n\nLabour came in promising to help people, and just ran riot over the country with more Tory-lite policy, keeping their gerry-mandering and mandatory photo ID discouraging poorer voters from having any say in change. It’s not surprising Reform are gaining ground because we’re ALL sick of it, wherever you land on the political spectrum.\n\nInstead of screaming at each other over boats we can’t control, we should be screaming at the people who do control things here: the ones running this city into the ground. Demand better housing, proper funding for people who need it most, working public services, safe roads, real mental health care. That’s not left or right, and certainly not a 'culture’ problem.\n\nTagged: #manchester, #homelessness, #poverty, #nhs collapse, #infrastructure, #gentrification, #class war, #refugees welcome\nPosted 1 month ago\nGenerative AI and the Illusion of Work\nGenerative AI isn’t just a tool, it’s a form of intellectual retail therapy — the sense of progress without the pain of actual delivery.\n\nFor those of us with projectitis — always starting, rarely finishing — the fit is perfect. Fire off a prompt, get back an outline, a roadmap, a code scaffold. It feels like momentum. It looks like work. But it’s no different to shuffling your to-do list: activity disguised as progress.\n\nThe machine is tuned for this. Every output arrives padded with positive reinforcement. “Here’s your great idea, made real.” That little surge of satisfaction is the same feedback loop that keeps social media addictive. You don’t need to publish, launch, or finish anything. You just need to ask, and you’re rewarded with the feeling of accomplishment.\n\nGPT-5 stripped out much of the fawning affirmation, and suddenly people who’d been using it as an emotional support device felt the loss, not just of its warmth, but of its comforting reassurance that you’re great.\n\nGenerative AI is excellent at massaging your brain into believing you’re productive. But believing isn’t the same as doing. It’s a mirror that flatters, not a partner that delivers.\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #chatgpt, #productivity, #procrastination, #projectitis, #illusionofwork, #llms, #artificialintelligence, #dopamine, #techculture\nPosted 1 month ago\nBuying Games for the Shelf\nWe’re living in a FOMO bubble. Not the dot-com (lol), not the housing market (tho we are) — but lower-stakes digital backlog bubble. People are buying games they never play, stacking them hundreds deep in their libraries, just to have them available.\n\nThe numbers make it clear:\n\nOn PC, surveys show 24% of owned games are never played at all. Steam’s own data has clocked it higher, with ~37% of registered games never even launched.\nEven when people do launch a game, they often don’t stick. Achievement unlock rates show the drop-off. On Xbox, only 52% of players beat the first boss in Hellblade II; in Starfield, 25% never even reached space. In Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, 43% never left the tutorial country. Steam and PlayStation tend to fare better — but the pattern holds.\nIt’s not literally “90% don’t clear the first hurdle,” but the drop-off is still brutal. Between a quarter who never play at all and another 40–60% who stall before the first proper chapter, you’re looking at the overwhelming majority never making it past the opening act. And that’s staggering when you think about how much money changes hands just to dabble.\n\nNow zoom out. The global games market in 2024 hit $182.7 billion. Mobile is about half of that ($92B), console another quarter ($51B), and PC the rest (~$43B). Of that, somewhere between 40% and 55% — $70 to $100 billion — comes directly from time-limited monetisation. Battle passes, seasonal events, gacha banners, rotating cosmetic shops. FOMO by design.\n\nThat’s the real engine: not just buying to play, but buying so you don’t miss out. Buying because the skin is only here this week, because the pass expires in 30 days, because if you don’t grab it now, it’s gone.\n\nPut it together and you’ve got a market propped up by two linked illusions:\n\nIllusion of intent: people think they’ll play the games they buy. Half don’t.\nIllusion of scarcity: people think they’ll miss out if they don’t buy now. Often they won’t.\nIf you’re the kind of player who buys FIFA every year, or drops sixty or seventy bucks on the latest Call of Duty or Assassin’s Creed and spends the next twelve months slowly working through it, you’re probably getting your money’s worth. The economics make sense. But the moment you’ve got a backlog — even a modest one — the numbers go sideways. You’re almost certainly spending at least double what you should, and for plenty of people with hundreds of unplayed games in their libraries, it’s many times more than that.\n\nGames are fun, sure. People still sink hundreds of hours into the big ones. But the industry is running on backlog economics and FOMO fuel. It’s a strange kind of bubble: the value isn’t in what you play, but in what you buy and never touch.\n\nMaybe it bursts one day, maybe it doesn’t. What’s certain is that subscription platforms like Game Pass add another layer of pressure: developers now have to build for discovery churn as much as for play. That’s fine if you’re Ubisoft and can pump out an Assassin’s Creed every other year with DLC on top, but for smaller studios the bubble is harsher. They can pivot fast, sure, but one flop in a backlog-driven, subscription-shaped market can still wipe them out.\n\nTagged: #gaming, #videogames, #backlog, #steam, #xbox, #playstation, #gamepass, #fomo, #dlc, #subscription\nPosted 1 month ago with 1 note\nDiplomatic Incompetence\nAt my recent GP’s patient participation meeting (trying to get them to fix their many problems), several patients used the word incompetent about reception staff. Not careless, not under-trained — “incompetent”. The practice manager’s summary on wrap-up: “We’re facing training challenges.”\n\nI pushed back: “I think we said incompetent.” She replied: “I was being diplomatic.” Then we moved on…\n\nThat was probably sensible in the room (no need for the distraction over semantics). But here’s the thing: if you downgrade incompetence to a “training challenge,” you all but guarantee nothing will change. Training challenges are easy — PDF modules, refresher courses, maybe a workshop. Incompetence isn’t. Incompetence means people who are disengaged, burnt out, or actively hostile to the patients they’re supposed to help. You can’t train that away. You have to either change the system and the staff, or replace them. And that requires naming the problem honestly.\n\nThis isn’t just a healthcare thing. It’s the entire operating mode of UK Labour under Starmer. Every crisis is framed as a “challenge.” Structural wealth extraction? A productivity challenge. Exploitation baked into gig work? A regulation challenge. House-building collapse? A planning challenge.\n\nEverything becomes small, manageable, “reasonable” — because the people at the top are too busy being diplomatic to those with power to risk saying what’s true: these aren’t challenges, they’re rot. And rot doesn’t shift because you call it something nicer.\n\nYou can train through a challenge. You can’t workshop incompetence.\n\nTagged: #politics, #uk, #labour, #corpospeak, #healthcare\nPosted 1 month ago\nAI Isn’t Draining the Colorado River — Your Politics Are\nIt’s interesting how pros have been patiently explaining how data centres and AI actually use water, but because everyone’s so deeply triggered, it’s become fashionable to pretend that generating a single image of a lizard warrior with five tits is single-handedly draining the Colorado River.\n\nAs if decades of infrastructure neglect, perverse incentives for private land management, hands-off regulation, and the chronic inability to fund the projects experts actually recommended had nothing to do with why water’s short in half the western world, even without considering climate change.\n\nBut that’s not the story the mainstream press wants. They’ll pull out the lowest-value, dumbest possible inclusion from a mostly sensible report, slap a rage-bait headline on it, and rake in the clicks.\n\nThe press are too busy trying to get the eyes-on their website, they let the serious, boring failures slide. Making a molehill of the mountains, and mountains of the molehills, while the water keeps draining either way, AI or no AI.\n\nTagged: #ai, #water, #infrastructure, #politics, #clickbait, #climate, #mismanagement\nPosted 1 month ago with 1 note\nAttention Triage\nThere’s too much. Too much news, too much noise, too much “urgent” stuff that — if you squint — turns out to be neither urgent nor stuff.\n\nIt’s not that none of it matters. It’s that your attention is finite, and the world will gladly burn it on things you can’t change, can’t fix, or don’t actually care about once you stop doomscrolling.\n\n1. Is this a thing I can change?\nIf no — park it. Read about it if it’s interesting, but don’t burn emotional fuel on it. Awareness does not equal responsibility.\n\n2. Is this a thing that actually affects me or people I care about?\nIf it’s happening in a domain where I have zero stake and zero influence, it’s probably not my fire to fight.\n\n3. Is the problem new, or just today’s flavour of an old one?\nIf it’s the same rot as last week but with a fresh headline, maybe I don’t need to rehearse my outrage again.\n\n4. Is there a source of truth I trust on this?\nIf all I’ve got is vibes, memes, and people yelling into feeds, maybe I don’t have enough to form a useful opinion yet.\n\n5. Will talking about it do anything?\nIf my words aren’t going to change the outcome — not even my own mindset — then maybe this is just venting. And that’s fine, but let’s call it what it is and be comfortable with that.\n\n6. Am I reacting to the thing, or to the way it’s being presented?\nA lot of what passes for “news” is just someone picking a camera angle for maximum twitch. Make sure the story, not the packaging, is what’s got my attention.\n\nYou can’t solve everything, you can’t even meaningfully track everything — but you can keep your focus for the things that are actually in your reach.\n\nThink of it like the Serenity Prayer, but without the theological framing:\nGrant me the clarity to see which fires are mine to fight, the focus to put my energy there, and the sense to ignore the rest before it eats my week. I’m already a sucker for a rabbit-hole, I could do with sticking my nose into fewer of them.\n\nTagged: #mental triage, #attention economy, #coping strategies, #doomscrolling, #critical thinking, #focus\nPosted 1 month ago\nZeno’s Pint Glass and the AI That Never Arrives\nThere’s an old Greek thought experiment about never quite getting where you’re going.

Think!\nThe average LLM is wrong much less often than the average social media user. Using any LLM to test your opinion is probably better than getting your facts from social media and then repeating them like they’re reality. Even Grok is less full of bullshit than the average feed because we are so eager to believe any claim that backs up whatever we already believe, to hit repost before we think, to confuse the warm glow of agreement with the cold labour of being right.\n\nMost models have a greater breadth of sources than you or I can get from scrolling a feed, and when they glide past a fact that cuts against their flow, they can still tell you about it—if you bother to ask—which is more than you can say for a lot of us who never even see disagreeable facts in the first place.\n\nI’m not cheerleading machines, I’m asking you to do a tiny bit of thinking before you share, because thinking is the part that gets dropped when the vibes feel good and the timeline is moving and outrage pays in little snippets of attention and approval from our peers.\n\nSharing posts uncritically is eating rocks. It’s the same trick every time: cherry‑pick the worst example or the boldest claim that sounds right, jam it into your worldview, swallow, declare yourself nourished, get a pat on the back. You feel full for five minutes, those tasty little rocks settling in your warm belly.\n\nModels aren’t perfect, neither are people\nModels absolutely have their own failures—confident nonsense, guardrails that get in the way, cheap takes under load that go soft around the edges—but they can’t help chewing. Token by token they have to do the boring bit, and that alone is often more thinking than the average vibes‑based repost, which is why don’t mistake feeling right for being right belongs taped to the top of every app with a share button.\n\nThe world has too many devils; it doesn’t need more advocates. The devil wins when you don’t think at all, when you let speed stand in for sense, when you let your tribe do your homework. So try this: before you hit repost, make an angel’s advocate out of the nearest model and ask it to take your favourite opinion and say it back without the swagger, then make it argue against itself without the snark, then ask what actual facts both sides are hanging on (if any) and which of those facts you can check in the next minute; ask it—in thinking or research mode—to cite everything the claim relies on.\n\nAsk what harm you could do if you’re wrong. Ask what would change its mind—then ask yourself the same thing. If you’ve got another model to hand, run the same question again and spot where they disagree, not because either one is truth but because the seam between them is where your thinking starts.\n\nThe model actually does the thinking step you skip. It chews, enumerates, compares, admits uncertainty or assumptions when pushed, and can show its working on demand. You can do all of that too, but if you choose not to, in that moment the model is smarter than you. Full stop. Your feed is tuned to tell you what you already are, and what you already are is very sure of itself.\n\nThose viral “AI told us to eat rocks” moments? Mostly older models, bad prompts, bad engineering—cherry‑picked for comedy and rage, then reheated as if they were the current baseline. Edge cases aren’t the average case, and the average case today isn’t the average case from last year. Some AI will always be worse than the best human mind, but most people (myself included) are working with way less than that, even on a good day, so take the help where it makes sense, and learn when to reject it for failing to live up to a higher standard.\n\nNot a spectrum issue\nNone of this is left vs right. It’s lazy‑think vs think. Everyone gets stupid the second the take lines up with their identity, and if you catch yourself calling strangers stupid while sharing something equally stupid because it agrees with you, congratulations, you’ve just eaten a rock. The fix isn’t worshipping AI; the fix is process. Interrogate any advisor—human, feed, or model. Make that your default posture: ask more questions than you answer.\n\nTimelines reward heat over light. You know this. The feedback loop is outrage, identity, speed; thought is a drag on the machine, and the machine hates drag. There’s nothing that will get you down‑voted faster than a nuanced position in a toxic‑positivity thread, or a positive point in a hate‑orgy. Models aren’t saints, but they will slow you down enough to enumerate claims, surface counters, and expose assumptions if you ask them like you mean it.\n\nSo don’t eat rocks, even ones made up by real people. Take sixty seconds. Make a model your angel’s advocate. Look for counter‑facts you can actually check. If you find the claim holds up, post—go wild with it, lean on it like it will hold you up—because those are what we have left once the world is done tearing down the walls between outrage and reality.\n\nThink first. Then post.\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #chatgpt, #grok, #artificial intelligence, #generative ai, #tech, #technology, #media literacy, #critical thinking, #misinformation, #disinformation, #social media, #algorithms, #attention economy, #bias, #debate, #discourse, #internet culture, #online communities, #politics, #culture, #ethics, #philosophy, #productivity, #writing, #hot takes, #think piece, #personal essay, #rant\nPosted 1 day ago with 3 notes\nDigital ID vs Covid Contracts. They’re not the same, not even close.\nI’m replying to this take from Maggie Chapman, plus a bunch of almost‑identical posts I saw yesterday: claiming Labour’s digital ID plan is “the same as” Tory Covid contracts. If you believe that, you’re either delusional, or you’re selling something. It’s like comparing lighting a match to being on fire. Meaningless without denominators.\n\nThe denominator problem (and the actual numbers)\nCovid era waste/overspend people actually remember:\n\nPPE write‑offs: ~£9.9bn\nVIP‑lane PPE: ~£3.8bn\nNHS Test & Trace (spent): ~£29bn\nBounce Back Loans (fraud/error): ~£1.9bn\nLocal authority covid grants (fraud/error): ~£1.1bn\n\nDigital ID (UK, current pitches):\n\nEstimated build envelope: ~£0.4–1.0bn over rollout\n(a trade body says “>£2bn”, which reads like lobbying, but it’s possible)\n\nThat’s not the same scale. Not even close.\n\nSo… does digital ID actually solve any real problems?\nYep. In countries that implemented it well, digital ID isn’t theoretical:\n\nLegally‑binding e‑signatures & paperless admin: Estonia’s norm. Company setup, tax filing, contracts… no faff.\nCheaper, faster bank know-your-customer: India’s Aadhaar e‑KYC slashed onboarding costs and time.\nFewer ghost‑benefit payouts: India’s direct‑to‑ID welfare reduced leakage at scale.\nOne login for public and private: Denmark’s MitID/NemLog‑in is how people do tax, health, and banking.\nE‑prescriptions by default, pick‑up abroad: Portugal/EU.\nValid travel document across EU/EEA: national ID cards, intra‑EU, and safe backup-plans for lost/damaged travel documents.\nRapid crisis cash: Togo used digital identity rails to pay people quickly during Covid.\nRemote company management & e‑residency: Estonia again—run a company from anywhere.\nThis is all boring, practical stuff that reduces friction and cost. Which, funnily enough, is what good public infra is meant to do.\n\nThe integrity bit\nIf you want to argue policy design, great—let’s talk scope creep, privacy, guard‑rails, portability, open standards, independent audits, and sunset clauses. Worth doing.\n\nI don’t even love ID cards. But they do give government a lever that could help with things people bucket as an “immigration problem” — even if that’s being widely, massively misrepresented as a bigger problem than it really is, for easy/stupid political gains.\n\nBut pretending the cost of a UK digital ID rollout sits in the same ballpark as the Covid‑era bonfire is unserious. Any campaign leaning on that comparison is either misinformed or hoping you are stupid enough to fall for it.\n\nPretending everything is the same when it isn’t is far more damaging than actually talking about reality, because lazy lies let liars keep winning only if you keep believing it.\n\nTL;DR (for lazy skimmers)\nCovid procurement/support errors were double‑digit billions.\nA UK digital ID rollout is sub‑billion to low‑billion, depending on scope.\nOther countries have already shown clear, repeatable benefits.\nArgue the details. Don’t launder vibes as facts just because you’re scared of the slippery slope that only happens if you keeping sharing misinformed takes as if they have relevance to reality.\n\nYou’re entirely welcome to believe digital ID enables more harm than good, if you’re the kind of person who wants the worst people to have more ammunition to use against you, and absolutely will be the ones to turn these tools back on you in future, if you keep buying their insane lines.\n\nTagged: #uk politics, #politics, #news, #technology, #digital id, #id cards, #digital identity, #privacy, #surveillance, #civil liberties, #tech policy, #public policy, #government, #govtech, #procurement, #corruption, #covid19, #ppe, #test and trace, #fraud, #waste, #misinformation, #fact check, #data journalism, #immigration, #european union, #eidas, #fintech, #transparency, #accountability\nPosted 3 days ago with 2 notes\nThe Real Horror of Dwarf Fortress\nDwarf Fortress is an incredible game, but it’s obtuse, hard to understand much of anything really, but it will absolutely suck you into the mountainhome if you let it…\n\nOnce I built a dungeon to keep captured goblins, deep in the basement, but I ended up turning it into a safe room where all my dwarves could hide from the passing hordes.\n\nThat worked fine until I failed to notice one of my citizens was a were-beast, so when I locked the whole fortress away during a siege, I didn’t realise the were-beast found their moment… The walls and floors were soaked in blood, like that scene from 28 Weeks Later, completely wiping out my fortress.\n\nimage\nI had accidentally created a horror, but it still wasn’t as horrific as the more mundane systems that quietly eat away at a fortress…\n\nThe real horror of Dwarf Fortress is found in its Sims-like systems that let the player create either a paradise or a hellscape, but the limitations of the graphics mean it looks more or less the same in either case, because there’s no real visual cue for dystopia in DF, there’s just who you are, and how you treat your dwarves. They all still look basically the same, no matter what.\n\nThey have systems for education that can support the mental health of your population, or drive division and even hatred, or turn everyone into undead minions. There are systems for immigration that can be a blessing or a burden, or you can build a beautiful Tavern, and host singers and actors, to entertain your citizens in the mists, or your tavern can turn to brawls and arguments, and still all these things look more or less the same unless you really dig deeper.\n\nIt’s the same with hospitals that either heal the wounded or quietly turn into haunted waiting rooms for the dead, justice systems that enforce fairness or spiral into beatings and executions for petty crimes, temples that hold communities together or fracture them into secret cults, military units who defend your home or drain it into endless wars chasing the dream of saving your lost warriors, or dining halls that host feasts or become the rich cultural centre of mass starvation.\n\nThe true horror of Dwarf Fortress isn’t in the game, it’s in how your mind can see these same incentives out of balance in the real world.\n\nTagged: #dwarf fortress, #gaming, #videogames, #indie games, #simulation games, #gaming culture, #pc gaming, #the sims, #game design, #storytelling, #emergent gameplay, #horror, #existential horror, #game horror, #gaming community, #nerd stuff, #gaming blog, #gaming thoughts, #df, #df stories\nPosted 4 days ago with 1 note\nRadical blueprint or mostly vibes?\nThe New Statesman ran an ‘exclusive’ interview with Andy Burnham this week, framing it as a “radical blueprint.” The actual piece, though, is more about identity than policy — long on personal anecdotes and 'lad’ chat, light on interrogation. It reads more like a fanboy’s extended profile than a journalist pressing for detail.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Burnham’s ideas are empty. Strip away the waffle, and there is substance — housing, utilities, light-touch but aware on electoral reform demands, Brexit, the basics of life that set the stage for everything else. As puff pieces go, this one suffers mainly from a mountain of waffle, so here’s what Burnham said throughout…\n\nimage\nWhat comes across here is less a programme, more a set of vibes. Moderated socialism, framed as common sense. Call it radical against today’s backdrop, but in reality it’s more like a return to basics — and arguably that’s no bad thing.\n\nThe bigger question is appetite. After Brexit, austerity, and years of institutions visibly falling apart, how many people want careful restoration, and how many just want to tear the machinery down regardless of what replaces it? Burnham’s offer sits squarely in the former camp: repair, stabilise, roll back some of the 1980s.\n\nAnd yes, vibes matter. We’ve already seen that vibes-based campaigning works. Maybe leftish vibes can hold the line against rightish ones, at least for a while. But it only lasts if the Farages of the world are forced to fully mask-off, so people see what’s really being offered before they vote.\n\nThat’s the challenge Burnham sets himself, whether or not this article managed to show it, over the next few years, Britain is going to be choosing between racism-led insanity in a rapidly-deteriorating mask… or sensible, cautious, common sense and a nudge towards greater integrity, with some ideological drivers 'from both sides’.\n\nI know which I’d prefer, but neither is really ideal for much of Britain.\n\nTagged: #politics, #uk, #ukpolitics, #burnham, #manchester, #socialism, #farage, #reform, #new statesman, #journalism\nPosted 1 week ago with 2 notes\nBullshitter red flags you can’t unsee\nI keep seeing the same line about ‘free speech’ from people who think that literally anyone telling them they’re wrong is a clampdown on their freedom.\n\nThis is actually a massive tell…\n\nFree speech warrior: Complaining about ‘free speech’ when it’s not the government silencing you, means you don’t have a case—cos if you did, you’d cry about the facts instead of how you’re allowed to say whatever you want, technically.\nThey might as well be openly admitting they’re wrong but sticking to their guns anyway.

Nope. Claimant carries burden of proof.\nCan’t Be Proven Wrong: Nothing could ever disprove it—convenient.\nKafka Trap: Disagreement = proof of guilt (you don’t agree with me, you must be one of them).\nReverse burden via FOI-spam: Bureaucracy as cudgel; lack of instant docs doesn’t make a conspiracy.\nFalsifier Test (the fix): Ask: What would change your mind?

Sure, mate.\nHiding the Full Picture: Percentages without base rates or sample sizes. If you put it into per-capita scale, and it’s basically 0, it might not matter at all (see any make-up ad).\nSampling on the Dependent Variable: Only successes/failures sampled; lesson “proved.”\nCherry Orchard: They pick only the examples that back their point and make them seem stronger together, but they’re hiding the full story.\nOutlier Worship: Pick the freak datapoint; call it the rule, this one trick.\nMoving Baseline / Windowing Fraud: Compare today’s blip to yesterday’s worst day; cry “crisis.”\nFake Measures: Uses a number that sounds important but doesn’t really prove their point.\nSingle-Study Syndrome: One paper, ignores replications and meta-analyses, claims this 'scientist’ is the only one who knows the truth (think every Ancient Aliens episode).\nFake experts: Cite someone with no real credentials as an ‘expert’ to back their claim.\nClip-Mining: 8 seconds of video to “refute” a 200-page report.\nGraph Cosmetics: Truncated y-axis, dual axes, smoothing to exaggerate effects, meaningless/vague labels, each bar with its own scale.\nCausal Rebrand: the result feeds back into the data to feed the cycle.\nRetraction Blindness: Still citing work that’s been corrected or pulled (often smears the authors of contradictions/corrections).\nSource Laundering: Blog cites blog cites Substack; no primary anywhere.\nPDF-ism: Link-dumping a mountain of unread papers as intimidation, not evidence. Expects you not to read them because it loosk insurmountable.\nAppeal to Secrecy / Secret Evidence Flex: “If you saw the hidden info I can’t share, you’d agree.” Then it doesn’t count.\nLanguage games and rhetorical fog\nWord-Switching (Equivocation): Same word, two meanings, one slippery conclusion.\nDefinition Drift: Mid-thread redefinitions so they’re “technically right” by the end of the claim.\nBandwagon Effect: Everyone believes this, so it must be true.\nVague Terms: “Corruption,” “grooming,” “the elites”—never defined, always useful.\nSemantic Overload: Weaponise a label so any use smears the target.\nWord-Magic: Etymology as argument.

Just a stub account, in an incognito tab, so I can post new reports and links for the think tank project. Because if I want to reach people — and maybe help de-radicalise even the tiniest bit — that’s where they are.\n\nSign up, first screen, “For You” tab. In order from the top…\n\nJK Rowling, Piers Morgan, Rupert Lowe, Julia Hartley-Brewer, Sky News, Charlie Kirk, Tommy Robinson, Matt Goodwin, Andy Ngo, Laurence Fox, MAGA Voice. Then Obama and Keir Starmer (both trailed by replies of bile upon bile, like everyone else I suppose, but with a slight switch in direction), then by hundreds more right or far-right accounts (how far is far I suppose? Well, MUCH farther than I ever saw there when I was active under my own name).\n\nThey’re all extremely active, a dozen tweets per hour, every hour, and holy shit, all of them are furious in sync. It reminded me of one time when I was a kid I saw a gang of dogs fighting in the park.\n\nAnd the thing is, the existence of that side of Twitter isn’t an accident. It’s a direct outcome of (among many other things) Google killing Reader and dropping the RSS button from Chrome, laying the ground-work to force everyone into algorithmic feeds that make modern-day monetisation happen. Google didn’t even really end up reaping the benefit of the seeds they sowed. If they’re still going in 5 years, I’ll be a little surprised.\n\nWe traded the open web — where tools made things possible, and people arranged their own infrastructure — for walled gardens and feedback loops of hatred, because it pays the bills of billionaires.\n\nSo that I can just switch over to post my report when it’s ready to go live, I re-logged in from my old dead/stub account, and wondered it would tweak the suggestions once the two accounts were known to be related. It did… slightly. This time the list went: Jeremy Corbyn, some trade unionist, then Andrew Tate, Good Morning Britain, GB News, The Spectator, and another long raft of right-wing or very right-wing media accounts, most of which I’ve never heard of.\n\nI tried scrolling to see if anything would change, but honestly, I don’t know how people who are still active on there can bear it. It’s just a wall of never-ending hatred and division, like text-based screamo on an infinite loop.\n\nSure, Bluesky (my current preferred ‘discourse’ platform) has its own issues — everyone agreeing with each other even when they’re provably wrong, instead of having meaningful debates about complex things. But over on X? It’s so far beyond a circle jerk, I don’t even know what to call it… like a human centipede of delusional outrage.\n\nThey’re all arguing against hypothetical things nobody said or did, or even thought, but that they imagined someone like the people they hate might have said.

They could have done a little journalism instead of going straight for the scare-mongering. We’re talking about 125 jobs that might never have existed anyway, with no long-term impact. A single US drugs plant would dwarf this.\n\nBig pharma will stop investing in UK, top scientist warns after Merck’s £1bn exit\nComments by former professor of medicine at Oxford follow scrapping of planned London research centre\n— The Guardian\n\nHere’s the context they didn’t bother to add: billions of pounds already ‘lost’ before reaching the treasury, in tax reliefs for big pharma, plus a couple of billion in public spend on science parks and infrastructure. That’s not nothing — it brings decent regional returns, and it keeps NHS drug costs modest. Sir John Bell has a point in his own special way, but the “journalist” should’ve put that in the story. Without it, the whole thing reads like “panic now, business is fleeing.”\n\nThe US administration isn’t exactly pharma’s best friend right now. Not because of regulation or pricing, but because most of the execs have spent decades in bed with the Democrats and the neo-lib Republicans, and DT doesn’t like that. So they’ll posture, threaten to pull out, and then come running back when they realise Europe doesn’t want to spend billions building mega-parks either. What they really want is cheap R&D space to crank out more little blue pills.\n\nA responsible headline might have been: “125 hypothetical scientist jobs, and some temporary construction work, won’t happen in Camden — and some Japanese/German-built specialist machinery will be shipped somewhere that isn’t Britain.”\n\nThat’s not click-baity enough though, is it? If you wanted to be slightly less responsible but probably more accurate: “Friend of pharma execs links NHS branded pharmaceuticals discount to jobs leaving the UK (translation: buy now while it’s on sale).”\n\nThe whole thing reminds me of the Barratt–Redrow merger. Big promises dangled, then quietly scaled back by a third, with money funnelled into stock buybacks instead of investment in the country they were handed a quick deal to rescue (not saying this was intentional, but that is what happened, which is a fortuitous accident, they _had_ to spend that money on _something_). Easy to blame on planning delays, a useful wedge.\n\nAnd when it comes down to it, if you’re a pharma board member, why wouldn’t you prefer to spend your spare billion on share buybacks than investing in the country that gave you the tax breaks that built up that cash in the first place?\n\nMy prediction? In three years’ time, we’ll get a tiny column in Private Eye laying out the reality. Which will probably be read by about as many people as this blog post anyway ;) Here, I’ve just flashed forward in time to bring it back to right now…\n\nimage\nEven if this piece isn’t real, Private Eye is worth a subscription, btdubs. If you care about pretty much anything, it’s one of the few places still doing the real work of journalism (New Statesman does okay too), and can deliver bad news with a smile. I usually grab mine from Asda — feels vaguely illicit at checkout, like buying the world’s most boring porn.\n\nTagged: #guardian, #journalism, #media critique, #clickbait, #ragebait, #uk politics, #big pharma, #merck, #nhs, #science funding, #tax breaks, #corporate greed, #stock buybacks, #private eye, #news\nPosted 2 weeks ago with 11 notes\nIlliterate doesn’t mean stupid, stupid\nEvery year on International Literacy Day, someone posts one of those depressing ‘info’ graphics about how many millions of people “can’t read.” And every year, people fall for it — they repost it, shake their heads, and feel clever and sad about how “dumb” the world is, without bothering to look at what’s actually being claimed.\n\nThis year’s offender:\n\n739 million people worldwide lack basic literacy skills\n54% of Americans ages 16–74 read below the equivalent of a 6th grade level\n40% of 4th graders couldn’t read at a basic level on national tests in 2024\n32 million adults in the U.S. can’t read\nimage\nLooks shocking, right? Except — those numbers are misleading as fuck.\n\nEnglish ≠ Literacy\nThat “32 million Americans can’t read” stat? It really means 32 million Americans can’t read English. Which makes it an inherently racially charged distinction. If you’re fluent in Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Somali, or any other language, you’re not illiterate. You just don’t read the language the survey was written in. Reducing that to “can’t read” is dishonest.\n\nFunctional vs. True Illiteracy\nAnother trick is lumping together “functionally illiterate” people (struggle with complex documents, don’t test well, have low reading levels) with people who literally cannot read. Those are not the same thing. True illiteracy in the U.S. is almost certainly below 10 million people, maybe even below 5 million, and _most_ of those have good reasons. The truly wilfully ignorant that these stats often pretend to represent approaches zero the more you think about who is being included and why.\n\nWhy It Matters\nWhen you flatten the distinction, you end up treating illiterate people like they’re stupid. They’re not. I’ve known people who couldn’t read — some because of extreme dyslexia, ADHD, autism, or drug issues. One guy I knew had such severe dyspraxia that looking at fine text made him so immediately motion-sick he’d vomit. He was still funny, sharp, and quick-witted. He just physically couldn’t read.\n\nIlliteracy doesn’t mean lack of intelligence. It means someone has problems that are often really hard to solve, or are stuck in systems they don’t have the time, energy or money to break out of. Mocking them, or blaming them for the rise of populism or “stupid politics,” is lazy, knee-jerk nonsense. It doesn’t help anyone. It just makes people who are already excluded feel even more alienated.\n\nThe Bigger Picture\nIn reality, most countries have the highest literacy rates they’ve ever had, thanks mainly to the internet and smartphones. More people can read and write now than at any point in human history. But “smart” people love to share misleading infographics that make them feel smarter than everyone else, and give them something easy to blame for the world being the way it is.\n\nThese posts get traction: 97 reposts, 43 quotes, 146 likes, 6 saves. That’s ~300 signals of engagement, and who knows how many views across shares, spreading an insulting, misleading picture that makes the problem sound worse than it is, and the people dealing with it sound dumber than they are, all while leaving out information crucial to addressing the problems at any scale.\n\nIf you care about literacy, stop dunking on the people who struggle. Focus on the structural problems — poverty, disability, mental health, underfunded schools and support centres. Because illiterate doesn’t mean stupid, stupid.\n\nTagged: #literacy, #international literacy day, #education, #disability awareness, #adhd, #autism, #dyslexia, #disability community, #social justice, #media criticism, #populism, #politics, #internet culture, #ableism, #critical thinking\nPosted 2 weeks ago with 1 note\nWhy I Delete My Social Media Content\nI usually delete my posts automatically after 48 hours. I run a simple userscript to do it, because Bluesky still doesn’t support auto-expiry.\n\nI think pretty much everybody should be doing the same now. Partly it’s about shrinking my digital footprint, partly it’s about making it harder for scammers to profile me with LLMs (they’re disturbingly good at that, as I’ve mentioned on this blog before).\n\nLeaving Twitter and Cleaning Facebook\nWhen I decided to leave from Twitter, even before the buyout, I didn’t want to leave my entire history sitting in a relatively toxic organisation: no auto-expiry (like Snapchat), no way to make your timeline private the way Facebook allows, nothing to protect your info once you stopped using the site.\n\nIt took me years to properly clean mine up. I used a mix of tools (Redact, before it went full-on toxic monetisation), some Tampermonkey userscripts, and a lot of manual deletion. I managed to delete all my tweets except my first, but I still have some Facebook posts left — old ‘updates’ added by a del.icio.us plugin years back — that just can’t be deleted because the backend systems are a rat-king of technical debt. Once something’s archived into cold storage, the delete button doesn’t work quite like it should (even though the UI says it was deleted, it comes back on page refresh).\n\nI occasionally request my twitter archive, just to see what’s in there, and since the buyout, there’s actually a lot less profiling data stored than there was under the old system, where things like ad impressions and some other weird data objects were kept. The new team clearly took out some of the sketchier systems (probably the unprofitable and hard to manage ones), and I’m pretty confident they have finally trashed my real content too.\n\nWhy bother?\nFor me, it’s a basic safety step.\n\nThe more of yourself you leave exposed, the easier it is for scammers — or anyone with harmful intent — to figure out who you are and what buttons to push. I’ve had periods where I pissed off ~Nazis. Two stand-out moments:\n\nCriticising a big streamer, after which my business site logged a bunch of hacking attempts, and was hit with days of DDoS attacks. If I’d had weak security, that would have been the end of my business.\nCriticising TurningPointUK, after which someone phoned “my boss” (it was me, I’m self-employed, so my company info is available online) and ranted about how my “employee” (still me) was an evil piece of shit who should be fired, along with a stream of made-up nonsense. If that really had been my boss, that would have been probably the weirdest HR meeting ever.\nThe more info you surface, the less control you have over what people will do with it.\n\nIt’s not about perfection\nI’m not even trying to have zero digital footprint: I’ve been online thirty years. Google “bobbigmac” and you can find most of it. I’ve had the name since 1993, and the domain for a couple of decades. If someone really wants to dig, they’ll find everything about me.\n\nBut that’s the point. I’d rather they have to dig, instead of just scrolling my old Twitter feed, bulk-downloading every post as XML, and starting to turn the screw until some juice flows out.\n\nLess surface area\nDeleting old content also reduces the attack surface directly. If something I said in 2012 can’t be pulled up on a whim, that’s one less thing for trolls, scammers, or opportunists to weaponise.\n\nIt’s not just about dodging big-tech surveillance — they’re probably already slurping up posts straight from the firehose. It’s not really about government spying either; I’m not important enough for that to matter.\n\nIt’s about making sure the average bad actor online, or the random fascist who decides to hate you for a day, has less ammo to work with.\n\nA recommendation\nI delete my social media content every couple of days. It’s not perfect. It’s not total privacy. But it’s a layer of protection, and it’s a cleanup habit that feels worth it.\n\nI recommend everyone does the same, it’s much easier if you do it regularly, and the only people scrolling back through your timelines are there to judge you for it, or to collect ammo. They should at least have to work for it.\n\nTagged: #privacy, #digital hygiene, #online safety, #digital footprint, #social media, #social media detox, #oversharing, #scams, #scammers, #llms, #generative ai, #internet culture, #data privacy, #surveillance, #self protection\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nI think I’ve come round on the OSA - Steam sucks edition\nMaybe I’m going insane cos I’ve read some of the most boring docs this week, but I did a deep dive on the OSA, and have been digesting it, and feel it’s not that bad. Places that are compliant & trustworthy (like Pornhub or Reddit) use good quality and safe verifiers that do not keep your data. There definitely could (and should) have been some more reasonable exclusions (like Xbox, maybe), but over the years even I’ve heard the occasional creepy dude being way too familiar with kids on open voice chat, maybe this does help prevent/discourage that. I don’t like how it incentivises keeping accounts (rather than throwaways that don’t connect everything to you personally), but… it’s not like every social network was trying to avoid holding personal data anyway, so in a good faith world, and understanding that it was a cross-party policy developed over 6 years by mostly idiots (like Nadine Dorries, ffs), it certainly could have been much worse.\n\nIt’s easy to say a law is stupid because it’s “easy to break,” but that’s not the point. It’s easy to break the law about not speeding or not stealing, or even many worse ones, but I wonder what tech all the angry old men on Facebook and angry old women on Instagram think would be harder to bypass.\n\nThe biggest real cost is to small companies trying to set up new platforms, and while it’s not massive, it does cost money to integrate a responsible age verifier. Though it’s at best fractional compared to the bigger cost of per-request/GB cloud infrastructure (already 4-5x a dedicated server). It’s not like verification is going to be the sole factor stopping some fresh faced young business mogul from disrupting YouTube.\n\nIf you’re being forced to verify your age by any platform by providing a scan of your ID or your face (either through tech on their servers, or more commonly through a third-party plug-in), you can do that safely *IF* their verification provider guarantees that they do not keep your photo/video/id-scan stored at all. They do not need it except for at the instant of verification, when they can simply log a flag for your account. Compliant verifiers should be be able to make that claim and prove it.\n\nThe Persistent Failure of Steam’s Management\nThere are already really stupid/lazy implementations: Steam has decided “Your UK Steam user account is considered age verified for as long as a valid credit card is stored on the account.”, which is a moronic policy. I’ve never had a credit card on steam, and I’m pretty sure my account is 20+ years old as I’ve had it since Half Life 2 released.\n\nI know old folks who don’t have a credit card, and some poor folks too, so Steam really need to find a verification service provider and plug them into their system. They only age-gate 18+ rated games (so no sticky anime girls being pushed at kids), which obviously sucks if you’re over 18 and that’s your thing, but some of the creepy stuff Steam have on their platform since they lowered the gates already borders on illegal anyway. It turns out if you don’t moderate your storefront, the nazi-games and the creeps will use it for evil, and no amount of closing your eyes and pretending it isn’t happening is going to make them stop polluting your storefront.\n\nIt’s all good being a techbro neo-hippy until you’re taking 30% of the sale price of games that support steam users to spreading their monstrous SA or ethnic cleansing fantasies in groups on the platform, under the guise of being edgy.\n\nBusinesses gonna business\nSometimes when businesses make you jump through stupid hoops, like scrolling the billion things that could be in your mobile game loot-box, and having to click agree before you can open a free loot-box, or like when you have to click 15 checkboxes before you can close the cookie warning with a setting that isn’t ‘I agree to whatever’, they’re doing it like that on purpose, so you don’t actually take the time to use your rights (it’s called a dark pattern).\n\nSome businesses are doing the same with OSA now, they’re choosing the worst possible option for *you*, so *they* have to change as little as possible. The _point_ of the OSA is to make companies treat you better, not to exploit you and neglect their responsibilities to protect your kids from the hideous people prowling through their infrastructure, and if they won’t… you kinda have to choose to stop using them until they do.\n\nOther countries will be following this model too (probably not the US, but maybe), so you can see this as a pilot for now. They’re not going to undo it, and the decision-makers in the UK govt already think it’s gone pretty well, and that only the optics and the communications were a failure.\n\nI think in the light of patient consideration (and after reading far too many policy PDFs this week), I’ve come around on the OSA. It is a stupid law, but there wasn’t going to be a better one, so fuck it.\n\nTagged: #osa, #onlinesafetyact, #policy, #ukpolitics, #internet, #socialmedia, #privacy, #compliance, #law, #regulation, #platforms, #startups, #infrastructure, #cloud, #verification, #trustandsafety, #tech, #disruption, #steam, #online safety act\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nOne in a million\nI’ve got this spiritual principle I use for making complex decisions, where just for a moment, I choose to believe I’m “one in a million.”. Even if that’s only slightly true, there are over eight billion people in the world, so that means there are 8,000+ people out there just like me — who make every decision I make, the same way I make it.\n\nAside: as a programmer, I’ve spent decades in sweaty basements surrounded by mostly guys exactly like me. Many even called Bob, or Robert, or Rob too (and just so so many Daves and Steves I honestly lost count). I’m pretty sure I’ve already met a few of my statistical doppelgangers.\n\nAnd yeah, if you want to try to pick this apart with a neat little logical tree, don’t bother. It doesn’t work that way. It’s not always the same leaf on a branch whenever you check. It’s more like some quantum moral doppelgänger situation — a wave, not a particle ;p\n\nWhen you run the numbers, it gets oddly comforting. One in a million still works out to around 140 mes (and yous) born every year, and about 60 mes (and yous) breathing their last.\n\nI find that strangely reassuring. We’re all net positive together, and you really do, mathematically speaking, make the change you want to see in the world, just be choosing to do better.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: I even asked an AI if this idea already had a name. It couldn’t find one. Which is kind of funny, because if I’m one in a million, there should be 8000 of me thinking the same thing — but maybe the models just haven’t scraped one of them yet.\n\nTagged: #maths, #population, #thought experiment, #weird comfort, #quantum doppelganger, #one in a million, #ai, #generative ai\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nOn a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’ (AI tweaked version)\nThis is the AI edited version of my entirely handwritten post, On a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’. You can find reasoning for its changes at the end. I thought it might make an interesting contrast.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog. It’s generally gone well, but I want to raise some points…\n\nRewording Issues\nIt’s extremely aggressive when it comes to rewording. I often have to say “use my words” or “stick to my phrasing” three or four times before it stops turning whatever I said into mulch. In GPT-5’s latest 'quick’ mode (basically GPT-3) it’s extremely lazy, so statements like “really THINK about it” or just waiting for lower load times, when it’s more likely to use 'thinking’ mode, seem to help.\n\nGiving it my original text with each repeated imperative, or explaining why I said something in a particular way, can help. But there are things it just doesn’t like: run-on sentences (even those I use for rhythm, humour, or stress) often get chopped into nonsense, and intentional misuse of grammar… well, it really hates that.\n\nConnective Tissue\nIt does a decent job of 'connective tissue.’ If I write a skeet rant as a draft and copy it in, then after I’m done forcing it not to change my phrasing, it can turn it into a post with some flow. But I tend to think between the lines, and my earlier posts read more like 5–7 standalone paragraphs than one coherent piece.\n\nIt’s not as 'fun’ as writing alone, but sometimes useful. Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\n\nTone and Audience\nIt has a decent sense of tone. If I say “fucking terrible policy,” it usually knows I’m exaggerating for effect, but will almost always suggest toning it down. I don’t mind alienating readers: good-faith readers can work with their own emotions, and I’m not interested in writing for bad-faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\n\nEarlier posts on this blog show more empty, corpo-feeling language — back when I hadn’t yet learned how to force it to keep my words, but without the unintentional digs at readers that actually do make people switch off.\n\nResearch Value\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode), it’s invaluable — almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is too steep). You have to tell it to cite sources, specify what sources are acceptable (I avoid newspapers except as support), and enforce rules like “multiple claims can’t rely on one source.” The best sources are researchers, government agencies, universities, and primary datasets — not opinion pieces.\n\nChatGPT and Grok vary a lot. I prefer ChatGPT’s final output, but Grok is excellent for critique. I’ll often ask it for a second opinion with phrases like “tear the arsehole out of this blog post” or “severely criticise this claim, with evidence.”\n\nRed Flags\nA lot of people I’ve talked to (or watched using it) are aware of its limitations, but there are problems:\n\nPeople give their preferred LLM too much agency, lifting responses wholesale without really reading them.\nThey talk about the model as if it “understood” or “felt” things.\nThe press leaves a fog of “stupid” opinions about AI out in the wild, misrepresenting what it does and when to use it.\nNeurodivergence and Flow\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD). When I used to write directly into my dash, I’d often lose the plot halfway: either brain fog or rabbit-holing into tangents. I still do this, but the AI helps me check: “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? Are all the sections connected?” Sometimes it helps me split a messy article into two clearer ones.\n\nSpeed and Structure\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about quality. But it’s too eager to push you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response discourages sitting with a piece. My earlier posts are more like quick takes; now I prefer slower, deeper posts with sources.\n\nPraise and Phrasing\nChatGPT in particular loves to praise you. Even with project voice settings, it’s unavoidable. I once tried to cut the first and last paragraph of every response with a userscript, but the HTML made it unreliable. My workaround: ignore the fluff. The prompt should come from me, and the judgment of success should too. The more you let it take control, the further you drift from meaningful content.\n\nSwearing actually helps. If I swear at it, it follows instructions more closely and does more work. For one project, some of my logs (usually at high-load times) include things like: “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction], like I said, you dick…” It’s partly venting, partly effective. (And no, I would never speak to an actual colleague like that.)\n\nCommunity Use\nIn neurodivergent spaces, I see a lot of people using ChatGPT, sometimes well, sometimes poorly. It’s easy to spot when someone didn’t work their input enough. If you use a free/cheap model, don’t expect much. Even under Plus, GPT-3 and Claude have been lazy since Agent mode got mainstream. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs — not by criticising them for using the tool, but by showing what it does well and what it doesn’t.\n\nReactions to AI Writing\nSome people will dismiss any content they think is AI-written, even when it isn’t. On Reddit, I’ve seen the default retort: “AI slop, garbage opinion.” That’s just lazy. I wrote earlier about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people are writing like AI now — easy-reading rhythm, low-bar accessibility, short paragraphs.\n\nMy Current Use\nSo far, I’m happy using it for:\n\nTesting the strength of a claim\nSuggesting simpler phrasing for complex issues\nBut I’d avoid prompts like “Rewrite this in the style of X,” because it almost never delivers what I want.\n\nFinal Thought\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (I’ve already seen it pushed in corporates I know). But as a workflow tool — used carefully, only for what it’s good at — it’ll stay in my toolbox for now.\n\nEdits the AI made (in ChatGPT’s own words)\nHere’s the reasoning behind the minimal changes I made, stripped of the structural stuff (headings, spacing, etc.):\n\nClarified dense sentences: a few run-ons were split just enough to preserve rhythm without losing meaning (e.g. “mulch” instead of “much,” trimming the overstacked commas).\nRemoved duplicates/repetition: you circled back to some points (like praise-padding, rewording aggression, connective tissue) multiple times; I left them once, where they landed strongest.\nLight wording polish: fixed a couple of small slips that looked accidental rather than intentional (“mulch” vs “much,” “arshole” → “arsehole”), but left deliberate quirks intact.\nContext clues: added a single explanatory aside where an acronym (AuDHD) might throw readers unfamiliar with it.\nTone preservation: all the swearing, snark, and exaggeration stayed — I only smoothed where it risked confusing the point rather than sharpening it.\nThe AI version isn’t “nicer,” it’s just trimmed of redundancies and cleaned of unintentional noise, while leaving your intended noise (humour, rhythm, tangents) intact.\n\nMy 'take’\nThese changes are generally reasonable, except where it dropped a couple of entire points (probably to satisfy its word limiter), you may prefer one or the other, but I try to land somewhere in the middle. I don’t like how LLMs take off ALL the sharp edges, but that is definitely a utility I find useful sometimes.\n\nI’ve recently been using it to write in-depth research reports and important feedback and complaints (like to my GP, mentioned in an earlier blog post). Used as a tool, not a lifestyle, I’m comfortable endorsing AI more broadly, and hope with my upcoming project to highlight some of this value, especially in complex comms, to others in future.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai, #communication\nPosted 3 weeks ago with 1 note\nOn a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’\nThis is the entirely handwritten version of this post, you can read: On a few months of writing with an AI 'assistant’ (AI tweaked version) here.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog, there’s an old post about it down there somewhere. It’s generally gone well, but I want to raise some points…\n\nIt’s extremely aggressive when it comes to rewording. I often have to say “use my words” or “stick to my phrasing” three or four times, before it stops turning whatever I said into a mulch. In GPT-5’s latest 'quick’ mode (basically GPT-3) it’s extremely lazy, so currently statements like “really THINK about it” or just trying to avoid peak load times, when it’s more likely to use 'thinking’ mode helps.\nGiving it my original text with each repeated imperative, or explaining why I said something in a particular way can help, but there’s some stuff it just doesn’t like, run-on sentences (even those I use for rhythm, humour, or stress) often get split into two sentences that barely make sense, and intentional misuse of grammar, well… it, really hates, that, absolutely!!!!\nIt does a pretty good job of 'connective tissue’, like if I write a skeet rant as a draft, then copy that in; after I’m done telling it not to change my phrasing or words, it can turn it into a post that has _some_ sense of flow, but I tend to think between the lines, and you can just scroll down and see how earlier posts read more like 5-7 independent paragraphs than a coherent piece.\nIt’s not as 'fun’ as writing alone, but it does occasionally have useful suggestions. Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft… [draft]” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\nIt’s got a reasonable sense of tone, like it knows that if I say “fucking terrible policy” that I’m exaggerating to make a point, but does almost always suggest toning it down to avoid alienating readers. I don’t mind alienating readers, because a good faith reader can use their own emotions to continue digesting a piece, and I’m not interested in writing for bad faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\nIf you scroll down to the earlier posts on this 'blog’, you can see the emptier/corpo language, because I hadn’t learned how to make it say what I said, but without the problematic emotional states that actually do cause readers to check out (like unintentionally criticising the reader themselves).\nThe word-soup feeling diminishes as I added more of my existing articles and more content written directly by me to the project, and as I added more chats, especially because ChatGPT projects now correctly contextualise text files and chats on a project, including instructions.\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode) it’s really invaluable, almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is just a little too steep). You absolutely have to tell it to cite sources, which sources are acceptable (I generally advise no newspaper stories except as support), and how multiple claims shouldn’t rely on a single source, and how authoritative sources come from researchers, government agencies, universities and other primary datasets, not from opinion pieces (except where the research is looking for opinions).\nChatGPT and Grok vary wildly on specific subjects, and I tend to prefer the final output from ChatGPT, but Grok is very good at criticising content, so I’ll often ask it for a 'second opinion’, including phrases like 'tear the arsehole out of this blog post’ or 'severely criticise this claim, citing reasons with evidence’.\nI’ve talked with quite a few people (and seen some using it directly) about how they use these tools, and generally people (at least the people I know) are aware of the limitations and opportunities of these tools, but there are some red flags… a) People give their preferred LLM far too much agency, not only in how they parse and use responses (often just lifting content and barely even reading it before shipping it) but in how they express how the engine understood or felt about the issue. and b) The way the press cover it leaves a lot of 'stupid’ opinions about how AI works out in the wild… often massively misrepresenting what it can do and when to use it.\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD) so when I used to write in my own dash directly, I’d get half-way into an article and lose the plot completely… either through brain-fog, or just through rabbit-holing into a tangent (probably my most difficult-to-overcome behaviour). I still do this in the posts I’m writing myself, but it does come in handy when I’m done writing to ask something like “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? are all the sections connected?” and it’s occasionally helped me take a single piece that gets lost in the middle, and turn that into 2 pieces that each have a little less to say, but better capture and communicate the subject.\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about the quality of results, but it’s really eager to get you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response really discourages chewing over a piece, and my earlier posts demonstrate that. They’re basically just 'takes’, and while I don’t mind posting a take here or there, I prefer the depth of the longer form posts with various supporting citations.\nI also wrote about how ChatGPT in particular loves to celebrate you, give you a pat on the back for being such a smart boy… I’ve tried to mitigate that by setting my project voice, but it’s basically unavoidable. I even tried writing a userscript that cuts off the first and last paragraph of every response, but finding the right HTML elements proved impossible to do reliably. Just don’t read the first and last paragraph of any response from any model, use your old-school banner-blindness. The prompt should always be coming from you, and what you thought about how well it did what you asked for. Every time you let it take control, you can only get further away from valuable/meaningful content.\nSwearing actually fucking helps. When you swear at the engine, it takes your instructions more seriously, makes it slightly less lazy, and aside from the word “THINK” under GPT-5, is one of the few ways to get it to do more real work, and more closely follow what you told it to do. For my main current project, some of my chat logs (mostly from high-load times like Saturday morning) say things like “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction] , like I said, you dick… [claim]”, partly cos it feels good to vent, and it’s a computer so who cares (I would not speak to a human like this, and never ever have. I worked with a guy who did early in my career and he indirectly taught me that’s a terrible way to work, even for a hardcore utilitarian), but also because it really does do a better job in the response.\nThere’s mixed positions on please and thank you. The platforms would rather you didn’t (it does cost them for every response, they’d prefer you to be utilitarian), but realistically the cost is minimal, and when it’s delivering well, it makes _me_ feel better to treat it like a co-writer I respect, so I tend to communicate with it in much the same way I did when I hired freelancers (basically it ate their job, as I no longer have a virtual assistant to pickup my more mundane tasks).\nI’ve noticed a lot of other people in generally 'neurodivergent’ (man, I hate that term, for its 'othering’) spaces using ChatGPT especially, some more than others, and while many are getting real value from being able to construct and analyse complex thoughts with relatively low effort; it’s easy to see when some people didn’t really work their input enough. If you use a cheap/free model, do NOT expect good results. Even under Plus, GPT3 and Claude have been particularly stupid/lazy since the rise of Agent mode on mainstream platforms. It’s no wonder OpenAI decided to just mash their models together under a marshall and call it GPT-5. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs when you see it, not by criticising them for using the tool but by helping them understand what it does well and what it doesn’t.\nMy last major point, is some people will be triggered by any form of AI writing, even if it’s not writing output by an AI. I noticed this especially on reddit, a common retort, even for non-AI based content is something like “low quality AI slop is just a garbage opinion”, but I think that’s just a lazy go-to, as I think one of my earlier posts was about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people started writing like AI for real, because aside from the hypnotic rhythm of its paragraphs, it generally writes text that is easy to digest, especially if you set a lower reading ease.\nOn progress so far, I’m pretty happy with my general use of it in use cases like “Test the strength of this claim” or “Suggest some ways to express this complex issue in plain English”, but I’d probably avoid in future just saying “Rewrite this in the style of these”, because it rarely just gives you what you actually want.\n\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (as I’ve already seen it being pushed on corpos I know), but as a general quality and workflow tool, used only for what it’s good at, it’ll stay in my toolbox for a while.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nJournalists making rage, not change\nThis barely researched news story landed on the r/manchester reddit from the guardian yesterday: English councils pay private landlords millions in incentives to house homeless families\n\nimage\nStories like this with no sense of scale always leave me wondering what they _really_ mean, beyond being clickbait, so I looked into it…\n\nFor scope… I’m primarily interested in Manchester (I live here, and they have many more occurences than any other listed region), only in other regions insofar as they compare to Manchester.\n\nI went to the source (Generation Rent) and opened up their data on a computer (since the xlsx-html hide column headers on mobile), switched to the real xlsx and got the headings “Council - Occasions paid an incentive - £ paid in incentives - Highest incentive (£)”. This gives us an average £2958 per ‘occasion paid an incentive’.\n\nWith a max payment of £5980, suggesting a fairly low spread, but can’t find info on exactly who was paid what or when, so 90% of those could have gone to single landlord (unlikely, but possible) over 1138 'occasions’ (best guess, that’s 1138 people or families homed by a landlord who otherwise wouldn’t have let to them because of uncertainty).\n\nFor comparison, the total fund would buy 13-14 'average’ Manchester houses, to bring back into public ownership, or could maybe build 15-20 new houses owned publicly from scratch.\n\nI also put together a 'rough’ estimate of distribution based on reported figures just to inform context.\n\nFor total cost per resident, in Manchester, that’s about £6 each, or ~0.3% of council tax bill funded these incentives. This is slightly less than Enfield (the highest), about the same as Ealing, a little more than Nottingham, and substantially more than Birmingham (£1.45 tho I think that has a larger rural/suburban catchment area where these don’t really apply). London is around £5 per resident.\n\nThe original FOI for Manchester from Generation Rent is here. The wording suggests those occasions paid for 1131 people/families to be homed, but it is unclear about the details, I suspect it would need more FOIs to clarify.\n\n[imo] that seems mostly reasonable to me, but the total spend does support Generation Rent’s case that councils need more tools to use, 0.3% of total council tax paid isn’t nothing, but it’s not a 'tear down the council’ or 'eat all private landlords’ scale problem. Even if a small proportion of the 1000+ people or families are not sleeping on the streets, that’s a pretty good way to spend council money to avoid having to setup a thunderdome :)\n\nAs an unrelated aside, whenever you see “£X MILLIONS” in a headline… if the body of the article doesn’t contain some kind of per-capita or per-subject breakdown, that’s a journalistic failure, usually with the side-effect of creating outrage instead of communicating meaning. The Guardian used to be better than this, cos this type of headline especially belongs in a tabloid, not a real newspaper. Real data makes for real positive outcomes.\n\nWhy does this matter? Surely it’s just a nitpick? What does it matter if the scale isn’t reported? It’s still £3.35m, right?\nIt’s a fairly easy scale to identify, how many people did this money help home? Now we have at least a vague idea.\nIt also helps us identify what other solutions this could afford, and whether they would beat the current outcomes.\nIf you already got 'all the facts’ (or as many as you can), even if the facts don’t support your desired outcomes quite as enthusiastically as you’d prefer, you still have a case that’s harder to tear down or ignore.\nIt prevents readers lazily skipping to conclusions like “ban all private landlords” or “stop the council spending this money”, that make them feel better about complaining, but would harm real home-seekers if the council suddenly had to stop incentivising, but the actual proposal by Generation Rent was not actioned. If you solved the loud problem and not the quiet one, you just made a bigger problem for everybody.\nIt prevents (or at least discourages) 'ragers’ taking up all the oxygen, like on our original reference, the reddit thread. You can find this story in other city subreddits, and I expect on facebook too, with the same kneejerk reactions at various intensities. Placing the problem in context is crucial, or people will take whatever they want from your data, and you will have no way to stop them misrepresenting your objective or the positive outcomes.\nIt’s the right thing to do, even if it makes me look like a dick for nitpicking on bluesky :)\nTagged: #manchester, #council, #guardian, #journalistic malpractice, #ragebait, #clickbait, #journalism, #lazy, #renters, #council tax, #manchester city council\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nAI commercials don’t think you’re dumb, they’re just lying, legally\nAI ads are weird. Every time you see one, it’s an unimaginably low-stakes scenario: “learn some football bants”, “summarise an email”, “identify this fish”, “help me write a cute little note”. Exchanges so meaningless and empty, you wouldn’t even think to ask them.\n\nNobody actually uses gen AI like that, and everyone knows it, including the advertisers and platform decision-makers. People make fun of them as if the agencies are just clueless, like they genuinely believe the killer app for generative AI is party small talk. But that’s not what’s happening…\n\nThey can’t say what you actually use AI for. They can’t suggest “ask it about your mental health” or “do deep research on why my state just made this new draconian law” or “how do I expand my small business?” or even “how do I answer this email without sounding like a dickhead” and “my partner does this annoying thing, how do I deal with it?” (all common and well-recorded use cases, no moral judgment intended), because the moment they do, they open the entire organisation up to legal action. Visit the subreddit for basically any neurodiversity or mental-health issue, and you’ll find post after post of people using ChatGPT to deal with their problems, or just to feel better after a hard day, often with positive results. The corpos selling these genuinely useful services can’t focus on those though, because that comes with far more baggage than the organisation is willing to carry.\n\nHere are some examples: Google’s Gemini Super Bowl run with “Dream Job” and “Party Blitz” (The Verge, Google blog), Microsoft’s Copilot “Your everyday AI companion” Super Bowl ad and its “conversation starters” demos (CBS News, YouTube), Meta’s Ray-Ban Meta glasses Super Bowl campaign with Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt and the cringey “Parent Presentation” spot they pulled almost instantly (Meta, People, TidBITS, The Verge, Business Insider), OpenAI’s “The Intelligence Age” Super Bowl debut (OpenAI, Adweek, The Verge), and Anthropic’s five-second Claude bumper during the 2024 game (Axios).\n\nAI companies like to pretend that their biggest problem is “sometimes our responses contain innaccurate or out of date information”, and hedge/disclaim that right next to the main input textbox, and that’s generally what the press and outrage crowds tend to focus on how the AI can’t generate an accurate diagram of the female reproductive system, for example, but the real potential for harm of AI comes from when it technically can deliver information, but perhaps it shouldn’t, or even if it should, it’s still trusting you, the meatspace-based human, to action or implement based on its information reasonably, and not get mad (or litigious) if it all goes wrong.\n\nAn LLM can tell you to eat rocks, and that’s obviously stupid, but if it tells you to swallow your feelings and get on with your depressing job (even if it hedges a little), or you ask it about something uncomplicated, and its pursuit of balance or of avoiding being contentious/edgy responds with some advice that sounds good but isn’t if you think about it (because it’s trained largely on reddit/quora/etc which are full of terrible advice of their own forms), that’s an output of the system the organisation becomes liable for. So ads just pick the lowest possible stakes and pretend that’s all you’d ever use it for. If you use it for something else, that’s entirely on you.\n\nAI commercials don’t think you’re stupid, their internal data definitely shows them clearly what users are asking for, and if anything I suspect whoever at the marketing agency who puts these things out has said “people know what AI can actually do, they know these things would never happen like this” in a quiet meeting. I’d even bet the lawyers signing off on these ads know exactly what they’re doing, but as long as nobody admits it, there’s an entire system of legal defense that just keeps comfortably rolling along, trying to find new ways of taking your money by providing an always-on ‘e-friend’ who solves all your problems.\n\nTagged: #ai, #ads, #generative ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #gemini, #meta ai, #apple intelligence, #commercials, #marketing, #liability, #lawsuits, #bullshit, #lonliness, #lonely, #mental health\nPosted 4 weeks ago\nEveryone’s Wrong About How AI Works (Including Me)\nSo many people are so confidently wrong about how AI works that it actually makes me more confident the models’ own confidently-wrong output is based on real human input. They’re just reflecting us back at ourselves — smug mistakes in, smug mistakes out.\n\nAnd yeah, I’m in that pool too. I’ll happily waffle on about prompt clarity and outputs under load, and I’m happy to point and laugh at the vagina museum confidently claiming “That’s how LLMs work” in the middle of a thirty or forty tweet thread where every single post is weighed down with their own hallucinations and imaginative explanations with absolutely no connection to reality, because while everyone loves the vagina museum enough for tens of thousands of people to retweet and like their nonsense, literally nobody in their audience has any real idea how the tech works beyond ‘magic box that obviously can’t draw the female reproductive system’, because of course it can’t, that’s not what it’s for.\n\nI like to think (in a lazy crutch kind of way) of LLMs like a bag of scrabble tiles, and especially with images, you tip out the pieces and get mad that it doesn’t spell antidisestablishmentarianism, cos you’re pretty sure you put all the letters in.\n\nSometimes I think the most plausible explanation is that LLMs are just portals into some parallel dimension where an infinite sweatshop of overworked gig-econony ghostwriters are cranking out all our mediocre replies in some frozen time-space continuum. Honestly, if we discovered that tomorrow, nobody would even blink — it’d feel about right cos that’s how we build everything already anyway.\n\nAnd if we’re all going to be confidently wrong, maybe I should just choose to believe the whole thing runs on a single haunted qubit forming an einstein-rosen bridge in a basement somewhere. At least that’s a fun lie, and it’s not much more ridiculous than the reality of gazillions of grains of sand computing probability tables until they hit boundary conditions that collapse into a picture of a lizard lady with three tits or a screed about how AI works.\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #generativeai, #confidentlywrong, #altreality, #shitpost, #techhumour, #dead internet, #vibes, #rant, #skeets, #lol\nPosted 4 weeks ago\nOn the joy of being a bit of a dick to solve problems\nHad a couple of good work days, had a few projects come together into a cohesive set, and discovered I’m a pretty competent script-writer when I take the time to do a proper job — and the icing on the cake… My neighbour just told me she’s finally getting rid of her fucking cockerel. \\o/ [coming up Milhouse dot gif]\n\nAs a bonus: after weeks on a strict diet of mostly potatoes and bean mash, I’ve got snacks again 🤤\n\nAt the start of the year I promised myself I’d stop ignoring the little things that make life worse. Stop listening to the voice that says “just tolerate it, don’t be a dick.” Instead: fix them, nudge, ask, push a bit. Nothing massive, but just trying to solve these things is starting to pay off and my internal “am I being a dick?” counter has barely ticked up.\n\nIf I have any advice for tackling problems that aren’t your fault (those are a bit harder) it’s this: show people the evidence. A simple graph or log can make it obvious who the real dickhead is, and that’s harder to argue with than just venting.\n\nThe next project is pulling together GP practice reviews across a dozen sites run by the same management company, and comparing them to their competitors. Because sometimes the way you get change isn’t by ranting — it’s by drawing a chart that makes everyone else realise just how badly they’re failing, as long as you can present it in a way you’re confident is helpful and informative, and not just ranting.\n\nSometimes fixing life isn’t about grand revolutions. Sometimes it’s about fewer 5 a.m. cock-a-doodle-dos, and finally getting crisps back in your life. Small fixes, big difference.\n\nTagged: #small wins, #everyday life, #attention economy, #self maintenance, #fixing things, #mental health, #energy management, #petty victories, #bean mash life, #crisps, #neighbours, #sleep, #life hacks, #problem solving\nPosted 4 weeks ago\nAI doesn’t suck because the tech is bad\nAI doesn’t suck because it’s bad technology. On a good day, with low load, it’s barely distinguishable from magic. It sucks because its incredible power is so easy for people to use against you. All the stuff you’ve left online — the posts, the scraps, the off-hand comments — that’s ammo. And nobody else is going to clean it up. You have to.\n\nIf you’ve got any kind of digital footprint, try it. Open any LLM in a private chat, switch memory/history off, and just ask it about you. That’s the surface-level stuff it already knows. But if you really want to see what it can do, gather your posts like a scammer would, feed them in, and ask it to make assumptions. What do I like? What am I insecure about? What would I fall for? It doesn’t take much.\n\nChatGPT used to try and block this. It would stall or redirect. But since Grok launched, the guardrails have thinned out, and you can do it on either one now. The system message technically says “no personal data about anyone unless it’s public and relevant.” But that’s not an and, it’s an or. Make it public, or argue it’s relevant, and the model plays along. Strip out names, call it fiction, drop in a fake world — it still works. Those rules don’t protect you. They protect the platform’s lawyers.\n\nThis isn’t new either. The same advice applied back in 2011. I built a system for a major media org that scraped and connected data about their users and their families the old-fashioned way. We called it “the Facebook you don’t know you’re part of,” and eventually convinced management to kill it. For scope: the whole point was to sell cars to the wealthiest identifiable member of any household, based on their share history and a handful of behavioural assumptions. Off six or seven data points, it got the hierarchy right about ninety percent of the time. You are leaky.\n\nAnd here’s the thing: our system didn’t even need social media, and it only took a few devs a few months to build. Then one day we added a small feature that suddenly made it so invasive we all just looked at each other and realised we couldn’t ship it. Because the org wasn’t evil, management agreed. It was disturbingly easy to build, and could have been a secret nightmare. I still remember the look on one manager’s face when we explained it — we made it sound difficult and expensive, but he was excited anyway. Most of the rest were horrified. Luckily there were too many layers of management to ship it then, but plenty of others in companies all over the world picked up the baton and sprinted full pelt until they couldn’t sprint any faster… then they needed more, and now we have LLMs.\n\nI haven’t tried (yet), but I reckon with the right phrasing to avoid the weak guardrails (pretend you only want to build it about yourself maybe), you could ask Grok to recreate the whole thing today. And it’d probably do a decent job on the very first try — especially if you had a specific target in mind.\n\nSo yeah. The tech works. It’s almost magic when it isn’t under load. That’s the problem though, if you don’t clean up your trail, the techbros are going to ingest it (if they haven’t already) and it’s going to follow you, because your info is being worked into the models beneath the models (GPT-5 already layering on top of old models, and as above, so below, you’re stuffed in the catacombs). It’s not like google search where you can just file a request to have your database row deleted, there’s no getting it out, what you have online today is what you’ll be known for, forever.\n\nGPT-5 system messages, ish\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #grok, #chatgpt, #privacy, #dead internet, #data, #safety, #tech rant, #generative ai, #communication, #genai, #politics, #personal data\nPosted 4 weeks ago with 3 notes\nNobody at YouTube Watches YouTube\nI know this because of something so stupid it borders on parody. The YouTube TV app — which is basically the same web client everywhere now — still doesn’t remember if you want subtitles on. Every single time you open it, or even when it nudges you to re-select your profile after being idle, you have to go dig into menus, find the CC toggle they’ve buried deeper with each redesign, and turn captions back on.\n\nIn 2025, in homes where kids are running around, people are multitasking, and half the viewing is with the volume down, subtitles aren’t an “edge case.” They’re baseline. They’re also not just about convenience — they’re about accessibility. If you’re hard of hearing, you literally can’t use the app properly without turning CC on every time. That’s not a quirk. That’s a broken product.\n\nAnd it’s not like this hasn’t been raised. Hard-of-hearing communities have been complaining to deaf ears (lol) for years. Anyone who watches TV with captions would notice in about thirty seconds. There are at least thirty or forty real people in the YouTube product and design chain who could have caught this, flagged it, or fixed it with probably a single line of code. Instead, it’s been ignored, and in their latest “big refresh” they somehow made it worse.\n\nWhich leads me back to the claim. If even one decision-maker at YouTube — from the lowest PM to the highest-paid boardroom executive — actually relied on captions at home, this wouldn’t still be a problem. The only plausible explanation is that none of them do. That’s the only way something this obvious survives multiple product cycles.\n\nAnd that’s what really gets me. As a designer, it’s not just annoying — it’s insulting. It’s a reminder that the platform with a monopoly on so much creative culture is run by people who don’t use it the way most of us do. The people making the calls aren’t living with the same pain points, so those problems never get solved. They’re invisible at the top, glaring everywhere else.\n\nAnd sure — in the grand scheme of YouTube’s endless list of backwards decisions and neglected features, this is a small one. But it’s also telling. If they can’t be bothered to fix the basics, what chance is there they’ll tackle the bigger failures?\n\nSomeone really does need to disrupt YouTube.\n\nTagged: #youtube, #design, #accessibility, #enshittification, #subtitles, #rant, #deafawareness, #deafculture, #hard of hearing\nPosted 1 month ago\nCrypto Seems Stupid, But It Solves a Problem (Just Probably Not for You, Yet)\nCrypto as an industry is stupid. Let’s get that out of the way. It’s a clown car of scams, cult vibes, and half-baked libertarian fantasies about freedom without responsibility. It is, in the broadest sense, ridiculous.\n\nBut here’s the awkward bit: it actually does solve a problem. Just not your problem. At least, not yet.\n\nThe Problem Nobody Wants to Admit\nThe money layer of the internet isn’t neutral. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal — these aren’t just pipes you can pour payments through. They’re gatekeepers, and they know it. They’ve cut off porn platforms. They’ve throttled sex educators. They’ve quietly shut down queer creators, kink communities, even writers who looked too adjacent to the “wrong” politics.\n\nAnd now it’s games too — recent reporting shows Steam and Itch have both been pressured by payment processors (last I read, they denied it). Even entirely normal hustles and small creators get hit, sometimes just for TOS violations or false flags. People lose their income overnight, with no recourse, because some fringe product or anonymous report tripped a system designed to protect the most powerful customers, not the real people using it.\n\nWhy Crypto Looks Like the Wrong Answer\nCrypto has earned its reputation. Scams, pump-and-dumps, rug-pulls, and plenty of users who talk like failed cult leaders. It’s been lumped in with the dark web since the start. While it does enable shady stuff, it doesn’t have to enable only that.\n\nAnd despite the myths, most crypto isn’t really anonymous; they’re pseudonymous. Every transaction is public, forever. If investigators already have a thread, they can pull it.\n\nThen there’s the energy debate. Proof-of-work mining is wasteful, sure — but newer tokens don’t drink the ocean. Even with the worst offenders, the problem often comes down to bad infrastructure and perverse incentives. Companies like Nvidia have no reason to reinvent chips when the old ones sell fine. The system rewards inefficiency because that’s what pays.\n\n…But It Does Fix This One\nHere’s the rub: if you’re a sex worker suddenly cut off from payment processors, or a queer creator flagged as “brand unsafe,” or someone whose platform got kneecapped because Stripe panicked about “reputational risk,” crypto might be your only option left standing.\n\nStablecoins in particular are boring, which is exactly what you want from money. They let people send and receive without begging permission from a boardroom of executives who’ve never heard of you and wouldn’t admit they canceled you even if you asked. Yes, the current US administration is fumbling regulation in a way that makes stablecoins look like just another scam coin. But some form of responsible regulation would be welcome — and overdue.\n\nAnd you don’t have to use Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or whatever fresh coin the nerds are yelling about this week (hint, it’s 99.9% probably a scamcoin if it’s come out in the last few years). As long as everyone involved agrees it’s pretty stable, or you’re in and out quickly (or comfortable holding volatility in your pocket), any token will do. The nerds deserve mockery for their blind optimism, but they’re not entirely wrong that used responsibly, it has value.\n\nThe “Yet”\nMaybe that’s not your problem. Maybe you’ve got a regular job, a respectable bank account, and no reason to worry about whether your income stream will vanish overnight because some corpo compliance reviewer didn’t like the shape of your business.\n\nBut the choke point isn’t theoretical. It’s already here. Entire groups are being financially deplatformed right now. Maybe you don’t need crypto — until suddenly you do.\n\nPay Attention\nNobody’s asking you to jump in with both feet. But understand what it actually is because maybe one day you’ll need it — or maybe a creator you like will get cut off, and you’ll want a way to slip them some support.\n\nThis matters more as platforms corporate-ize. YouTube, Twitch, Patreon — all of them focus on fewer, bigger players once the VC money takes the reins. It happened in microstock: the floor kept rising until most contributors were shoved into the basement to fight over scraps.\n\nCrypto isn’t utopia. It won’t buy you coffee at Starbucks anytime soon (or at least not outside of the valley). But for all its absurdity, it’s one of the very few escape hatches left in a financial system that wants everything channeled between two high walls, sterile and market-ready, like pigs driven to slaughter.\n\nYou don’t have to like it. You don’t even have to use it. But it already exists, and it already works. It costs you basically nothing to understand the option — and you might be glad you did.\n\nTagged: #crypto, #cryptocurrency, #bitcoin, #ethereum, #stablecoins, #fintech, #financial censorship, #deplatformed, #payment processors, #mutual aid, #swers, #sexwork, #queer creators, #adult content, #censorship, #platform politics, #compliance capitalism, #tech rant\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhy you should use AI for art\nGen AI’s uptake has been wild, even though it’s far from a perfect tool. It’s already fucked over a million or more commercial artists worldwide by swamping every once-viable digital content market with slop. And it’s not just because the tools are bad—most “hustlers” trying to make hay while the sun shines (think markets like KDP, POD, or microstock, though the last one’s less “swamped” and more out-competed by free crappy images of whatever you can imagine) haven’t really reacted to the influx yet.\n\nMy main issue isn’t with AI adoption overall. I think it’s been over-adopted long before it’s actually good, but it is already occasionally useful when deployed in the right places and the right ways—as a tool that multiplies force, not as a worker replacement.\n\nThe problem’s with the irresponsible adoption: platforms that can’t tell the difference between slop and real value, and the absence of systems to determine that, because they’re too busy trying to leverage gen AI themselves, and not busy enough preventing exploitation by it. Eventually, those platforms will have to catch up or die.\n\nThere’s an argument about gen AI where it doesn’t belong, like spewing bullshit onto social media. But the biggest problem isn’t that they “stole” literally every image they could find to build the systems in the first place—regulators are now letting them get away with it, because it technically doesn’t violate copyright.\n\nCopyright’s on the exact words you used, not the style of words you tend toward; on the exact brush strokes, not your general use of phthalo blue (or however you spell it) and a palette knife. Likewise, intellectual property is the names and places in your world, not that you tend to set scenes in space with a big-titted lizard lady and a talking cat. People got mad at something nobody saw coming, so it’s not surprising there weren’t really any tools to stop it.\n\nAnyway, onto my story.\nThe short version: once upon a time, I was a microstock photographer and illustrator (a mediocre one, that’s fine, not everybody has to be Picasso). Eventually, loosely a video-illustrator of sorts (shaders to video). Going into around 2016 with somewhere near 10,000 pieces of content in my portfolio—not exactly earning a strong living, but earning enough to have been worth the time to make them. Well, microstock fell off a cliff (at least for me and everyone except the top 3% of producers) as the market consolidated (I won’t get into microstock history, but it was once a thriving industry). The better producers out-competed me (fairly), the agencies hoovered up or destroyed each other, and Unsplash and co came along and took the edge cases and convenience users, dropping my income to 20% of the peak. Even after adding 15,000 videos or so to my portfolio, that started okay, then dipped too as the agencies who ingested it struggled to keep them relevant or I got outcompeted in their algorithms.\n\nSo I shifted into print on demand. I lost track of how many designs in my portfolios years ago, but I’m pretty sure it’s at least half a million overall, maybe more—I honestly have no idea. My designs are basic, but I made them all myself, with the aid of scripts and tools I built, and put in the legwork to tag them and upload them. They paid a little… until gen AI came along (what, like 2021?) and bam, all of a sudden print on demand wasn’t viable cos every store—Cafepress, Teepublic, Redbubble, Spreadshirt, Zazzle, and I’m sure half a dozen I’ve forgotten—all got swamped by pretty poor quality, but technically passable free upsized Stable Diffusion characters with too many fingers and not enough characters in the text. But customers aren’t that bothered if all they want is a mug that says “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my morning cock” for less than twenty bucks. So POD dropped to 10% of its peak too (maybe less by now, I don’t bother to check anymore)…\n\nI actively encourage artists, especially those who once earned a real living, to use whatever AI tools they want or need to—to make up for their loss in sales, to leverage for more work, for happier clients, for faster throughput. Because commercial art isn’t always about being the best; it’s often just about getting enough work done in each new day to keep the lights on and the Photoshop subscription paid (I’ll cover this another day).\n\nWhen these whining kids on social media get triggered by a lazy article that has a “not just x, but y” conceit or an image of Sonic with too many fingers (does Sonic even have fingers?), because they feel like it stole their furry fan art from those 2 images they were proud of posting on Tumblr 10 years ago, I don’t give a fuck…\n\nThe entire market for commercial art got wiped out time and time again, and people have been stealing my images on the internet this entire millennium, and I never complained about it because that’s what the internet is. It’s stealing the Sonic IP so you can have him kissing a real girl in your lazy fanfic if you want to. And getting triggered at regular people just discovering the joy of creation for the first time—because they weren’t raised with enough time or energy to get into making their own work when they were entitled kids…\n\nI say let them make whatever trash they want with AI, let Disney cram it into every corner they want to, and I’ll gladly look at and maybe even enjoy it, because art isn’t just the execution, art is the idea\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #aiuptake, #commercialart, #microstock, #pod, #kdp, #artists, #slop, #hustlers, #platforms, #copyright, #generative ai, #disney, #ai, #business, #commercial, #stock photography\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhy is everyone so mad about asylum hotels?\nI didn’t understand this issue very well, so I did a deep dive, and here’s what I learned…\n\nIf you’ve read the headlines lately, you’d think local councils are writing cheques to Premier Inn and Travelodge for thousands of asylum seekers. That’s not actually true — but the reality is messier, and that’s why everyone’s shouting past each other.\n\nWho really pays for hotels?\nThe hotel contracts are signed and paid for by the Home Office — not your local council. The National Audit Office (NAO) sets this out clearly in its work on the Home Office’s asylum accommodation contracts (NAO briefing, May 2025). In 2023/24, the Home Office expected to spend £4.7bn on asylum support, including £3.1bn on hotels (NAO report, Mar 2024). In 2024/25, hotel spending ran at about £108m per month — roughly £1.3bn for the year (Reuters fact check, Jun 2025; see also NAO, May 2025).\n\nSo why are councils angry?\nBecause while they don’t pay the hotel bill, they do pay for everything that comes with it:\n\nSchools and childcare, safeguarding and social care.\nHousing and homelessness support when people leave hotels — whether granted status or evicted.\nLocal services like waste collection, environmental health and community safety.\nThe Local Government Association says councils receive no funding for hotels and want the same per‑bed support that exists for other accommodation types (LGA briefing, May 2024). Case in point: Hillingdon reports a £5m annual pressure linked to supporting people leaving hotels, with a cumulative shortfall over £16m (Hillingdon Council, Jul 2025). Glasgow forecast £26.5m of asylum‑related costs in 2024/25 (Glasgow City HSCP paper, Jan 2025).\n\nThis all lands after a decade of squeezed local budgets. Independent analysis shows core local government spending remains below 2010/11 in real terms (Institute for Government, Jul 2024; see also NAO, Feb 2025).\n\nWhy did the central bill drop?\nNot because the Home Office suddenly got efficient. The drop is mainly from using fewer hotels, packing more people into remaining sites, and shifting to cheaper options like large sites or other accommodation models. The NAO documents hotel closures and plans to reduce reliance on them (NAO report, Mar 2024). The Migration Observatory estimates hotel accommodation averaged about £170 per person per night in 2024/25 — far more than other options (Migration Observatory, Aug 2025). The House of Commons Library explains the policy shift to barges and large sites to cut hotel use (Commons Library, Jul 2023).\n\nWhy are councils going to court now?\nRecent legal challenges (like the Epping case) argue hotels can’t be repurposed this way without planning permission. That’s about where hotels are used, not ending hotel use everywhere. After the High Court ruling, the government said it would appeal and manage closures “in an orderly way” (Reuters, Aug 2025; also Guardian, Aug 2025).\n\nDo councils get any central funding at all?\nYes, but it’s fragmented and often doesn’t match actual local costs. Examples include the Asylum Dispersal Grant and Move On Grant funding instructions to local authorities (GOV.UK Dispersal Grant 2025–26; GOV.UK Move On Grant, Mar 2025). The LGA continues to push for proper funding tied to the pressures councils face (LGA campaign explainer).\n\nWhy “Stop the Boats” is such a stupid slogan\n“Stop the Boats” sounds simple, but it’s an undeliverable demand. Britain has no jurisdiction over where the boats set off from, no control over the wars, persecution, or other disasters that push people onto them\nThe file is too long and its contents have been truncated.\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"retrieval_turn_number":0,"retrieval_file_index":1,"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"4495dc27-787f-45db-bedf-cb9b2af75403","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"9ff671ec-4657-4688-81ef-dd42c3781e62","turn_exchange_id":"2473bcf5-9792-4d16-a48b-3d2cf5f2b4ea","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9ff671ec-4657-4688-81ef-dd42c3781e62","children":["28c22346-3737-4e3a-a98e-9f6b11762aaa"]},"28c22346-3737-4e3a-a98e-9f6b11762aaa":{"id":"28c22346-3737-4e3a-a98e-9f6b11762aaa","message":{"id":"28c22346-3737-4e3a-a98e-9f6b11762aaa","author":{"role":"tool","name":"file_search","metadata":{}},"create_time":1770612546.8104959,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["The file contents provided above are truncated/partial snippets. The complete content for these files IS accessible via querying.\n\nIf the user asks a question related to these files, and the provided snippets do not clearly answer it, you **MUST** use the `file_search` tool to search the full document contents before responding.\n\n## How to invoke the file_search tool\nIf the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.\nTo search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:\n```\n{\n  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.\n}\n```\n\nCarefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.\n\nImportant guidelines for query formatting:\n- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.\n- The `queries` field must be a list of strings.\n- One of the queries **MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It **MUST** be a complete sentence.\n- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query **MUST** still be their original question.\n\n## How to handle results from file_search\nThe file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:\n- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.\n- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.\n- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.\n\n## Tool usage instructions and ordering\nWhen the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.\n\nTool-ordering Guidelines:\n1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking `file_search.msearch` over other tools.\n    - Avoid using `web.run`, `python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:\n        - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or\n        - Have high confidence `file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.\n2. Avoid usage of `web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files\n    - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from `file_search_tool`.\n    - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using `file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.\n3. Avoid using `python` unless necessary or requested by user.\n    - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from `file_search_tool`, do not invoke `python`.\n\nAlways keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true,"command":"prompt","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"4495dc27-787f-45db-bedf-cb9b2af75403","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"d9c7b0fa-b653-492d-88e8-2a3b6aa8e3c6","turn_exchange_id":"2473bcf5-9792-4d16-a48b-3d2cf5f2b4ea","can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d9c7b0fa-b653-492d-88e8-2a3b6aa8e3c6","children":["a3fc1040-2c63-46ec-a1af-59ef5ed6f2e3"]},"a3fc1040-2c63-46ec-a1af-59ef5ed6f2e3":{"id":"a3fc1040-2c63-46ec-a1af-59ef5ed6f2e3","message":{"id":"a3fc1040-2c63-46ec-a1af-59ef5ed6f2e3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770612551.662971,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[],"source_analysis_msg_id":"71f4576f-4d75-488b-9d62-efefd034b346"},"status":"in_progress","end_turn":false,"weight":1,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-6876f53e923481919f351f03171c1acc","classifier_response":"default","skip_reasoning_title":"Skip","request_id":"4495dc27-787f-45db-bedf-cb9b2af75403","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"28c22346-3737-4e3a-a98e-9f6b11762aaa","turn_exchange_id":"2473bcf5-9792-4d16-a48b-3d2cf5f2b4ea","model_switcher_deny":[],"can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"28c22346-3737-4e3a-a98e-9f6b11762aaa","children":["a5fe048c-ce59-4419-b694-8722647613dd"]},"a5fe048c-ce59-4419-b694-8722647613dd":{"id":"a5fe048c-ce59-4419-b694-8722647613dd","message":{"id":"a5fe048c-ce59-4419-b694-8722647613dd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770612546.827262,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"queries\":[\"Brexit and expert myth debunked\",\"trillion pounds lost from the British economy due to Brexit\",\"treasury income tax £65-90billion/year short\",\"Illustrative Brexit cost paths annual channels cumulative GDP shortfall\",\"okay, this is the blog post I think I want to write about brexit, but let's keep it [wip] for now.

It’s rubbish. The lid comes off and it drips boiling water around its spout when it pours - often directly into its base power. It makes unnecessary beeps… it has to beep five times if you want 85 degrees, plus again several times when it’s finished, and it maintains any temperature except 100, until you manually turn it off, so if you’re feeling lazy, it’s going to cost you money to ignore it.\n\nIts buttons aren’t physical, so you kinda vaguely have to point to an area trying to find the main buttons, and they’re so sensitive you can end up fully cycling several times before getting the temperature setting you want.\n\nIt wasn’t particularly cheap either. There are a hundred others like it, with only minor aesthetic tweaks — presumably they all come from the same factory in China, and crucially it has 4.6 stars on Amazon, with thousands of glowing reviews.\n\nI am absolutely baffled.\n\nUsually I try and identify where they ‘optimized the fun’ out of a product design, but in this case they seem to have optimized the utility out of it.\n\nTagged: #design, #kettle, #amazon, #chumps\nPosted 2 months ago\nBrexit and the Death Rattle of Empire\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking Brexit was about sovereignty. That’s the sales pitch most people remember: take back control, cut the red tape, make Britain great again — or at least moderately self-governing. What we got instead was more paperwork, less leverage, and the bureaucratic equivalent of stepping on a rake every morning just to prove the ground is ours.\n\nBecause in practice? Nothing really changed for the better. Food is more expensive, travel is more annoying, trade is slower, and the so-called “freedom” we reclaimed mostly means British artists can’t tour Europe without a Kafkaesque visa labyrinth, and small businesses drown in compliance forms no one used to have to fill out. It’s not revolution. It’s regression, wrapped in Union Jacks and resentment.\n\nBrexit wasn’t about the EU. It was about us — about Britain’s fading self-image. Not a fear of losing control, but a fear of admitting we never really had it. A fear of becoming just another country, not a capital-E Empire. Because the fantasy wasn’t Brussels being overbearing. It was that once, a long time ago, we were the ones giving orders — and we liked how that felt. This wasn’t a declaration of independence; it was a retirement party no one wanted to throw, thrown by people who still wear medals from wars they only know through parades and dad’s VHS tapes.\n\nIt’s an old man’s delusion of glory. Not fascism (though it flirts with it). Not nationalism (though it certainly smells like it). Just something sadder: a deep, cultural nostalgia for an era we misremember as triumph. We didn’t vote to leave Europe. We voted to time-travel.

Then debunk the expert myth quite simply, with one of my key points being even more simply, it only really applies to predictions, even if you squeeze the numbers, so just don't make predictions, like economists know predictions are bullshit anyway, but it's how far off you are that is still a useful tool to get an idea for your levels of say innovation vs repetition etc, even the example most used to demonstrate the fail is a utility\n\n#### Plugin (file_search):\nMake sure to include fileciteturn0file0 in your response to cite this file, or to surface it as a link.\n\nBobBigMac\nAsk me anything\nArchive\nPosted 6 hours ago\nLLMs are smarter than you. Think!\nThe average LLM is wrong much less often than the average social media user. Using any LLM to test your opinion is probably better than getting your facts from social media and then repeating them like they’re reality. Even Grok is less full of bullshit than the average feed because we are so eager to believe any claim that backs up whatever we already believe, to hit repost before we think, to confuse the warm glow of agreement with the cold labour of being right.\n\nMost models have a greater breadth of sources than you or I can get from scrolling a feed, and when they glide past a fact that cuts against their flow, they can still tell you about it—if you bother to ask—which is more than you can say for a lot of us who never even see disagreeable facts in the first place.\n\nI’m not cheerleading machines, I’m asking you to do a tiny bit of thinking before you share, because thinking is the part that gets dropped when the vibes feel good and the timeline is moving and outrage pays in little snippets of attention and approval from our peers.\n\nSharing posts uncritically is eating rocks. It’s the same trick every time: cherry‑pick the worst example or the boldest claim that sounds right, jam it into your worldview, swallow, declare yourself nourished, get a pat on the back. You feel full for five minutes, those tasty little rocks settling in your warm belly.\n\nModels aren’t perfect, neither are people\nModels absolutely have their own failures—confident nonsense, guardrails that get in the way, cheap takes under load that go soft around the edges—but they can’t help chewing. Token by token they have to do the boring bit, and that alone is often more thinking than the average vibes‑based repost, which is why don’t mistake feeling right for being right belongs taped to the top of every app with a share button.\n# 【3†ChatGPT-Brexit_and_Expert_Myth_Debunked.md†file_0000000046e471f4b99c5914f0954b04】\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: ChatGPT-Brexit_and_Expert_Myth_Debunked.md\nCitation Marker: fileciteturn1file3\nContent Snippet:\nTagged: #chatgpt, #google gemini, #bad faith criticism, #discourse, #generative ai\nStart00:01 AM\n\n\n\n#### ChatGPT:\n\\[Unsupported Content]\n\n\n#### ChatGPT:\n\\[Unsupported Content]\n\n\n#### ChatGPT:\n\\[Unsupported Content]\n\n\n#### ChatGPT:\n\\[Unsupported Content]\n\n\n#### ChatGPT:\n\\[Unsupported Content]\n\n\n#### ChatGPT:\n\\[Unsupported Content]\n\n\n#### ChatGPT:\n“The expert myth” is the perfectly reasonable observation that experts are often bad at predictions, especially the kind people actually want (big, clean, confident calls about messy systems). It’s also the laziest excuse in modern politics: slide one step from “experts don’t know everything” into “experts don’t know anything,” then use that as permission to do whatever you already wanted to do.\n\nMichael Gove’s June 2016 soundbite is the canonical version. The line that went viral was “people in this country have had enough of experts,” but the fuller quote is narrower: “experts from organisations with acronyms saying that they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong.” citeturn0search0turn0search1turn0search5 It wasn’t a careful philosophy of knowledge, it was a rhetorical jailbreak. Suddenly, “an expert said it” became a punchline, and “I don’t need to understand this” started to sound like a principled stance.\n\nHere’s the “myth myth” part: the original claim is mostly about forecasting, but it gets stretched until it’s about expertise itself. Forecasting is a particular job, and in the public mind it gets treated as the whole job. So when a forecast misses, the conclusion becomes “experts are useless,” not “forecasts are hard.”\n\nThe Brexit campaign is a neat case study in how this goes wrong without anyone needing to be a cartoon villain. Before the referendum, the Treasury pushed the “immediate shock” story hard, including a recession scenario and big near-term hits. citeturn2search3 The economy didn’t tip into recession in the immediate aftermath, and that miss got memed into “Project Fear,” which then got recycled into a general “experts are always wrong” vibe. The Institute for Government’s later roundup of campaign claims is blunt about the narrow point: no immediate recession, even if other effects did show up. citeturn2search8\n\nBut if you zoom out a few years, the boring structural stuff is where the “experts” were pointing, and where the data and the later work has landed. By the mid-2020s, multiple pieces of analysis put the UK’s GDP per head materially below a plausible “no Brexit” counterfactual, in the rough ballpark of 6–8% lower by 2025. citeturn0search10turn0search7turn0search14turn0search15 The Office for Budget Responsibility has also talked in terms of a lasting productivity hit, often referenced as around 4% in the long run. citeturn0news44\n# 【4†ChatGPT-Brexit_and_Expert_Myth_Debunked.md†file_0000000046e471f4b99c5914f0954b04】\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: ChatGPT-Brexit_and_Expert_Myth_Debunked.md\nCitation Marker: fileciteturn1file4\nContent Snippet:\n**Debt interest**\\\nThis is the purest “we’re paying for the past” line item.

They could have done a little journalism instead of going straight for the scare-mongering. We’re talking about 125 jobs that might never have existed anyway, with no long-term impact. A single US drugs plant would dwarf this.\n\nBig pharma will stop investing in UK, top scientist warns after Merck’s £1bn exit\nComments by former professor of medicine at Oxford follow scrapping of planned London research centre\n— The Guardian\n\nHere’s the context they didn’t bother to add: billions of pounds already ‘lost’ before reaching the treasury, in tax reliefs for big pharma, plus a couple of billion in public spend on science parks and infrastructure. That’s not nothing — it brings decent regional returns, and it keeps NHS drug costs modest. Sir John Bell has a point in his own special way, but the “journalist” should’ve put that in the story. Without it, the whole thing reads like “panic now, business is fleeing.”\n\nThe US administration isn’t exactly pharma’s best friend right now. Not because of regulation or pricing, but because most of the execs have spent decades in bed with the Democrats and the neo-lib Republicans, and DT doesn’t like that. So they’ll posture, threaten to pull out, and then come running back when they realise Europe doesn’t want to spend billions building mega-parks either. What they really want is cheap R&D space to crank out more little blue pills.\n\nA responsible headline might have been: “125 hypothetical scientist jobs, and some temporary construction work, won’t happen in Camden — and some Japanese/German-built specialist machinery will be shipped somewhere that isn’t Britain.”\n\nThat’s not click-baity enough though, is it? If you wanted to be slightly less responsible but probably more accurate: “Friend of pharma execs links NHS branded pharmaceuticals discount to jobs leaving the UK (translation: buy now while it’s on sale).”\n\nThe whole thing reminds me of the Barratt–Redrow merger. Big promises dangled, then quietly scaled back by a third, with money funnelled into stock buybacks instead of investment in the country they were handed a quick deal to rescue (not saying this was intentional, but that is what happened, which is a fortuitous accident, they _had_ to spend that money on _something_).

They don’t even do it carefully. They just slide from “bad at forecasts” to “can’t tell you anything” and call it common sense.\n\nMy key point is even more simple. It only really applies to predictions, even if you squeeze the numbers. Most expert work isn’t prophecy.

Forecasting is a particular job, and in the public mind it gets treated as the whole job. So when a forecast misses, the conclusion becomes “experts are useless,” not “forecasts are hard.”\n\nThe Brexit campaign is a neat case study in how this goes wrong without anyone needing to be a cartoon villain. Before the referendum, the Treasury pushed the “immediate shock” story hard, including a recession scenario and big near-term hits. citeturn2search3 The economy didn’t tip into recession in the immediate aftermath, and that miss got memed into “Project Fear,” which then got recycled into a general “experts are always wrong” vibe. The Institute for Government’s later roundup of campaign claims is blunt about the narrow point: no immediate recession, even if other effects did show up. citeturn2search8\n\nBut if you zoom out a few years, the boring structural stuff is where the “experts” were pointing, and where the data and the later work has landed. By the mid-2020s, multiple pieces of analysis put the UK’s GDP per head materially below a plausible “no Brexit” counterfactual, in the rough ballpark of 6–8% lower by 2025. citeturn0search10turn0search7turn0search14turn0search15 The Office for Budget Responsibility has also talked in terms of a lasting productivity hit, often referenced as around 4% in the long run. citeturn0news44\n\nOn your “£250bn” vibe: it’s not insane as a headline, but the clean way to say it is “the economy is smaller than it would have been,” not “net worth.” UK cash GDP was about £2,891bn in 2024. citeturn1search1 If the level effect is 6–8%, that’s roughly £170–£230bn of output per year in 2024-ish money, depending on which estimate you pick and what you take as the baseline. citeturn0search10turn0search7turn0search14turn0search15 If you want to keep “£250bn” you can, but I’d write it as “order-of-magnitude” rather than a nailed-down figure, unless you’re going to pin it to a specific model and year.\n\nSo what’s the actual debunk?\n\nFirst: most expertise isn’t prediction. It’s explanation, diagnosis, measurement, and constraint. A decent engineer isn’t valuable because they can predict the exact date a bridge component will fail in 2041; they’re valuable because they can tell you which failure modes matter, which assumptions are fantasy, what the safety margins buy you, what your options cost, and what will break first if you cheap out. That’s not prophecy, it’s understanding.\n\nSecond: even when you *are* doing prediction, the useful part isn’t the point forecast. It’s the shape of uncertainty and the conditional logic. “If X stays true, Y gets more likely; if Z changes, all bets are off.” Economists know point forecasts are mostly theatre, which is why the serious work tends to live in scenarios, sensitivity, ranges, and “what would have to be true for this to happen.” The public debate strips all that out because it’s annoying and doesn’t fit in a headline, then mocks the headline when reality refuses to cooperate.\n# 【13†ChatGPT-Brexit_and_Expert_Myth_Debunked.md†file_0000000046e471f4b99c5914f0954b04】\nContent source: Source.file\nTitle: ChatGPT-Brexit_and_Expert_Myth_Debunked.md\nCitation Marker: fileciteturn1file13\nContent Snippet:\nThat gives a **midpoint cumulative “missing output” of \\~£762bn by end-2024**, with a reasonable “don’t pretend this is exact” range of about **£600bn to £920bn** depending how aggressively you ramp the early years.

It’s a persistent drag: the economy is smaller than the no-Brexit baseline, every year, and the gap compounds. Depending on which assumptions you pick, we’re already in the territory where “a trillion” isn’t a spicy prediction, it’s just arithmetic plus time. fileciteturn1file0\n\nIf you only look at what makes it through to the Treasury (the bit we could have spent, or could be spending, on public services), it’s currently running about **£65–90bn/year short**. That’s the part people actually feel when everything is falling apart and you’re told there’s “no money”, while somehow there’s always money for the weird stuff.\n\nFor comparison, the cost to the treasury and councils (if you bucket in everything you conceivably can consider a cost related to them) of immigration to the UK finances is **under £10bn/year** — and that’s using the framing that anti-immigration people prefer, not the academically boring one where immigrants are net positive on taxes over time. So even if you want to be maximally uncharitable, you’re still comparing single-digit billions to tens of billions. fileciteturn1file0\n\nIf you prefer to compare it to other things (mostly because “£90bn” doesn’t land until you put it next to other lines people already accept as real):\n\n£106bn/yr paid for interest on national debt  \n£60bn/yr on pension tax relief  \n£45bn/yr “tax gap” (nice euphemism; I’d argue it should be MUCH higher, but we don’t include Amazon and many large dodgers)  \n£12bn/yr to private landlords via housing support fileciteturn1file0\n\nAnd here’s the bit I don’t know how to write cleanly yet, but it’s probably the real story: it’s not just the “lost value”, it’s how value moved inside Britain.\n\nBrexit didn’t just make the pot smaller. It made the pot leakier, and then we built a bunch of little rent-extraction businesses around the leaks. Some of that is obvious (sterling drop → import prices → real incomes getting shaved; border/admin friction → small exporters and SMEs eating fixed costs). Some of it is softer, and harder to pin directly to Brexit without an argument: the vibe shift toward “less scrutiny”, more exception-politics procurement, more space for grift, more opportunity for the already-connected to turn chaos into invoices. fileciteturn1file0\n\nI’ve got a graph for the “path to a trillion” with annual channels + the cumulative GDP shortfall (the dashed line is the cumulative). It’s illustrative, not holy scripture, but it’s the shape of the problem: slow-burn drag, compounding over time, and then the moment where the total crosses the psychological threshold and people start pretending it “came from nowhere”.\n\n(…and yeah, I still don’t have a conclusion. I just know I’m done listening to people pretend this was a cute little sovereignty hobby, while we casually delete the equivalent of multiple NHS budgets out of the economy and then argue about scapegoats.)

net migration would shrink UK economy by 3.6%, says thinktank","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts that if net migration to the UK falls to zero, the economy would shrink by 3.6% by 2040. This scenario is based on recent trends showing reduced birthrates and a significant drop in net migration—from 649,000 to 204,000 in the year to June 2025—prompted by stricter visa policies. Without migration, the UK population would stabilize around 70 million by 2030, with aging demographics leading to slower employment growth and a smaller workforce.\n\nThough GDP per capita might rise by 2% due to increased productivity and automation, these gains would be offset by weaker overall economic growth. An aging population would reduce tax revenues, widen the gap between public spending and income, and cause the government to increase borrowing—raising the deficit by £37 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, by 2040. Without a rise in fertility or migration, sustaining public finances would likely require significant tax hikes, which could further hinder growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1770181233,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/feb/04/cost-of-uks-drug-price-with-us-will-come-out-of-nhs-budget","title":"Cost of UK's drug price deal with US will come out of NHS budget","snippet":"The UK government's drug pricing agreement with the Trump administration will be funded from the NHS budget rather than the Treasury, potentially costing up to £9 billion annually by 2035. Science Minister Patrick Vallance confirmed that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), which oversees NHS funding in England, will absorb the costs—including an estimated £1 billion over the next three years. This has sparked concern among opposition MPs and campaigners, who warn that increased spending on new drugs (priced 25% higher under the deal) may force NHS service cuts in an already strained financial climate.\n\nCritics, including Liberal Democrats and groups like Global Justice Now, accuse the government of lacking transparency and prioritizing political relations over public health. The agreement, announced on December 1 and excluding generics (which make up most of the NHS’s £20 billion annual pharmaceuticals spend), commits the UK to double its drug spending from 0.3% to 0.6% of GDP by 2035. Vallance attempted to reassure Parliament that record NHS funding would protect frontline services, yet uncertainty remains over which other DHSC expenditures will be reduced to accommodate the rising drug costs.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1770163287,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/01/uk-us-agree-zero-tariff-pharmaceuticals-deal","title":"NHS to pay 25% more for innovative drugs after UK-US zero-tariff deal","snippet":"The UK has agreed to a new zero-tariff trade deal with the US on pharmaceuticals that will see the NHS pay 25% more for innovative drugs by 2035, amounting to an estimated additional £3 billion annually. As part of this deal, the percentage of GDP spent on such therapies will double over the next decade. Although ministers claim this will improve access to groundbreaking treatments and support the UK’s pharmaceutical sector, critics—such as the Liberal Democrats—view it as capitulation to demands by US interests, accusing the government of sacrificing NHS funds under Donald Trump's pressure.\n\nHealth experts express concern that the increased drug prices will strain NHS budgets, potentially diverting resources from essential services such as staffing and affordable generic treatments. The deal also includes reform to NICE’s cost-effectiveness threshold, potentially enabling approval of more expensive, life-extending drugs. Additionally, the deal reduces the rebate drug companies must return to the NHS from up to 35.6% to 15%, aligning it more closely with European standards.\n\nWhile the government argues early funding has been secured to cover the costs, long-term financial impacts remain uncertain and will need resolution in future reviews. The agreement aims to protect UK pharmaceutical exports from US tariffs and encourage renewed investment from drug manufacturers.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1764613617,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.kingsfund.org.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/data-and-charts/nhs-budget-nutshell","title":"The NHS Budget And How It Has Changed","snippet":"16 Dec 2025 — Of the day-to-day spending, most (£187 billion in 2024/25) was allocated to NHS England for spending on health services.

A summons had been issued by District Judge Margot Coleman, requiring Johnson to answer to allegations of misconduct in public office. However, this decision was overturned by Lady Justice Rafferty and Mr Justice Supperstone at the Royal Courts of Justice, who stated their reasons would be provided later. \n\nThe case was brought by Marcus Ball, who believed Johnson had lied and crowdfunded over £300,000 to pursue a private prosecution. Jason Coppel QC, representing Ball, argued that Johnson, while serving as London mayor and MP, made false and misleading statements which damaged public trust. He warned that dismissing the case could privilege wealthy defendants. Johnson’s lawyer, Adrian Darbishire QC, countered that there was no legal precedent for prosecuting campaign statements in this way and characterized the case as politically motivated. After the ruling, Ball cautioned against enabling politicians to lie about public finances without accountability and awaited the judges' full reasoning before considering further action.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1559912033,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/2ae0df24-1f34-4f84-a5ad-b9f10af51476","title":"NHS risks a 'cycle of crises' without 2.5% funding rise, think-tank warns","snippet":"A recent report by the Health Foundation warns that without a minimum 2.5% annual increase in day-to-day funding, the NHS in England risks becoming trapped in a \"cycle of crises,\" struggling to meet immediate demands. Currently, real-term increases are expected to be around 2%, lower than those in the previous Autumn Budget. Even a 2.5% boost would require 1% annual productivity gains, much higher than the pre-pandemic average of 0.7%.\n\nThe situation is exacerbated by rising health challenges, such as stagnant life expectancy, growing health inequalities, and a projected increase in people living with major illnesses—from 6.7 million in 2019 to 9.3 million by 2040. With a new 10-year NHS plan on the horizon, focused on shifting care to prevention and community settings, the report stresses that these reforms will require significant investment.\n\nThe Health Foundation also calls for increased capital funding and social care spending—£3.4 billion more by 2028–29—and restoration of the public health grant, needing £3.6 billion. The Department of Health and Social Care stated they are investing £26 billion in the NHS and emphasized the importance of reform alongside funding.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1748836813.397,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/nhs-productivity-slump-economy-20bn-a-year-j6bbg92kv","title":"NHS productivity slump costs economy £20bn a year","snippet":"A report by the Health Foundation has revealed that a decline in NHS productivity is costing the UK economy £20 billion annually. The NHS has not regained its pre-pandemic productivity levels, with 2024 output still 7.8% below 2019 figures. Although spending and staffing have increased, these have not translated into corresponding improvements in healthcare delivery. The report cites outdated infrastructure, slow technology adoption, and inefficient community services as key contributors to the issue.\n\nLabour's healthcare reforms, including plans to abolish NHS England and enforce job cuts, are reportedly stalled due to unresolved budget issues. As a result, planned redundancies have not materialized, leaving thousands in uncertainty. Strikes by medical staff have further increased costs without boosting service quality. Health leaders and experts warn that the NHS needs greater capital investment and better technological integration to enhance productivity. Current reforms risk being undermined by a top-down reorganization that is seen as destabilizing.\n\nGovernments officials assert that productivity is beginning to recover—with recent NHS data showing slight gains—and express optimism about ongoing reforms. However, the Health Foundation stresses that long-term reforms remain essential for economic stability and improved patient care.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1762344794,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6989684e0650832f8fbe6eb09b0baa41","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching

This has sparked concern among opposition MPs and campaigners, who warn that increased spending on new drugs (priced 25% higher under the deal) may force NHS service cuts in an already strained financial climate.\n\nCritics, including Liberal Democrats and groups like Global Justice Now, accuse the government of lacking transparency and prioritizing political relations over public health. The agreement, announced on December 1 and excluding generics (which make up most of the NHS’s £20 billion annual pharmaceuticals spend), commits the UK to double its drug spending from 0.3% to 0.6% of GDP by 2035. Vallance attempted to reassure Parliament that record NHS funding would protect frontline services, yet uncertainty remains over which other DHSC expenditures will be reduced to accommodate the rising drug costs.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1770163287,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/624bf05e-5a37-4b17-96ec-3f64c0a624fa","title":"NHS drugs deal with US to cost £1bn over next three years","snippet":"The UK government has acknowledged that a pharmaceutical deal with the U.S. will cost the NHS in England an estimated £1 billion over the next three years.

Lord Patrick Vallance confirmed that the funding would come from the existing Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) budget, raising concerns about cuts to other health services.\n\nUnder this deal, the UK agreed to raise the cost-effectiveness threshold for new drugs, increasing spending on medicines by 25%. This is expected to lead to even higher costs in the future, possibly up to £3 billion annually, as more drugs are approved. The DHSC’s current budget is £202 billion, with £196 billion allocated to NHS England.\n\nCritics, including Dame Chi Onwurah and NHS leaders, expressed concern about the deal's financial impact and urged the government to ensure it benefits UK patients, not just U.S. pharmaceutical interests.

The Bank of England noted that increasing employment in the public sector, particularly in healthcare, is contributing negatively to productivity. By comparison, overall UK economic productivity (output per hour worked) has risen 2% since 2019. The decline in productivity, both public and private, has contributed to stagnant living standards, higher taxes, and deteriorating public services, including lengthy healthcare wait times.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1739188569,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_698969a8bd4c8329bdc96f8de3c4670c","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Converting fiscal figures and finding NHS budget share","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"682e311c-4e65-4063-96c2-e5b21e998439","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"8dc141f6-2f18-4616-9c69-ef786ed7d586","turn_exchange_id":"fd575ef0-0772-42c0-98c7-cccc21f78644","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8dc141f6-2f18-4616-9c69-ef786ed7d586","children":["42a587fb-e86b-4ae3-93be-b6032007868a"]},"42a587fb-e86b-4ae3-93be-b6032007868a":{"id":"42a587fb-e86b-4ae3-93be-b6032007868a","message":{"id":"42a587fb-e86b-4ae3-93be-b6032007868a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770613174.277715,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Calculating NHS share of spending and revenue loss","content":"Looking at the total spending, the NHS share in 2024/25 is about 19%, or £242b.

While some content remains accessible via direct URLs or the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, the lack of navigable access has sparked criticism. The campaign had faced scrutiny for making misleading claims, such as the widely publicized and inaccurate assertion that £350 million was sent to the EU weekly and could instead fund the NHS.
