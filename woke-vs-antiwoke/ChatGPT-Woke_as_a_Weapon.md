# Woke as a Weapon

#### You:
let's rough out a blog post "WTF is 'Woke' anyway?", it's extremely subjective, because it's not about specific issues, but about how groups form around issues. It's a perfect weapon because you can just decide it means whatever you want from any combiantion of the following: then list single-focus woke issues/beliefs in very very short form. The Anti-woke crowd can say you're woke if you believe any one of these things, and any one is enough to get you flagged as part of the 'reactive wokerati' (blue haired screaming lesbian meme types), but if most anti-woke thought about these same issues instead of getting triggered by them, they'd recognise/believe: the exact same issues 1:1 but it's from the perspective of 'the right' or the 'anti woke', like liberalism/freedom are the same basic idea, and/but the deeper you dig, the more you find points to split people, it's the vagueness that exists between people who believe the same basic thing, that let's the people who have real power keep using it to separate us, and how we keep using the false dichotemoy to lie to ourselves and what we believe (like to hide our own 'antiwoke' opinions, simple things like wanting your kid to marry a kid of a similar faith or social background, or ethnicity/religion,[don't dig too deep, it's a side comment, not a deep dive]). We're talking mainly about the words and their meaning, than about long spiels about what's so great about being socially progressive or triggered.

WTF is “woke” anyway?

At this point “woke” isn’t a description of a specific belief. It’s a tribal marker. A vibes-label. A way to say “those people over there” without having to name what you actually disagree with, or admit you don’t know.

That’s why it’s such a perfect weapon. You can make it mean whatever you want, on the fly, and your audience will nod along because the point isn’t precision, it’s sorting. It’s social autocomplete: say “woke” and people fill in the rest with whatever they already hate.

And because it’s subjective, it’s basically unkillable. If someone proves you wrong about a specific claim, you can just quietly swap the claim out, keep the label, keep the anger, keep the team jersey.

So if we’re going to talk about “woke”, we need to admit what it’s actually doing: it’s a bucket for a bunch of single-focus issues, most of which are either (a) normal human decency, (b) basic liberal ideas that conservatives also claim to care about, or (c) edge-case discourse that got algorithmically inflated into a fake apocalypse.

Here’s the kind of stuff people mean when they say it, in the shortest form possible:

Trans people exist, and deserve basic rights.\
Gay people exist, and deserve basic rights.\
Racism still exists (including in institutions), and it matters.\
Sexism still exists, and it matters.\
Don’t be a prick to disabled people.\
Consent matters.\
Kids should be safe from abuse.\
Police power should have limits.\
Your boss shouldn’t be allowed to treat you like meat.\
Healthcare shouldn’t be a luxury good.\
Housing shouldn’t be an investor sport.\
Poverty isn’t a personal moral failure.\
Refugees are human beings.\
Climate change is real, and we should probably react like adults.\
History happened, including the ugly bits, and pretending it didn’t is stupid.\
Some jokes are just cruelty with a grin.\
Some “free speech” arguments are really “I want to be a cunt without consequences.”\
Representation in media isn’t oppression.\
Words can be used to dehumanise, on purpose.\
Harassment isn’t “debate.”\
Nazis are still bad, actually.\
Conspiracies aren’t a personality.\
Facts don’t stop being facts because they annoy you.

Now here’s the funny part: loads of “anti-woke” people believe most of that list too, 1:1, when it’s phrased in their language, pointed at their targets, or framed as their values.

“Don’t treat people like shit” becomes “civility” or “manners.”\
“Government shouldn’t control you” becomes “freedom.”\
“Institutions shouldn’t discriminate” becomes “fairness.”\
“Kids shouldn’t be groomed” becomes “protect children” (even if they sometimes aim that panic at the wrong people).\
“Working people shouldn’t be ripped off” becomes “anti-elite” populism, until they vote for elites again.

Underneath the culture-war costumes, a lot of this is the same basic moral furniture. Most people want safety, dignity, fairness, autonomy, a decent life for their kids, and a world that isn’t visibly rotting. The split happens in framing, in trust, and in which examples your feed keeps shoving in your face.

And the deeper you dig, the more you find tiny seams to split people on. Not the big human basics, but the fiddly bits: phrasing, tone, terminology, which edge-case becomes the headline, which fringe activist becomes the face of an entire movement, which clip gets looped until it feels like the whole world. That vagueness between “we broadly agree” and “we agree on every detail” is where the label does its work.

“Woke” is how you take a messy set of overlapping values and turn it into a clean enemy. It’s how you convert “some people are annoying online” into “this entire political impulse is a threat.” It’s how you avoid saying: I’m uncomfortable with this change, or I don’t like this subgroup, or I feel left behind, or I just don’t want to think about this right now.

And yeah, it also helps people lie to themselves.

Plenty of people who loudly hate “woke” still hold soft, quiet preferences that look suspiciously like the thing they’re mocking. They just don’t want to say them out loud because they know they’ll sound bad. Stuff like wanting their kid to marry into a similar culture, faith, class, background, whatever. Most people have some version of that instinct. The point isn’t to moralise it to death here. The point is: the label lets you hide your own complicated opinions behind a simpler performance. You can be “anti-woke” and never have to admit which bits you actually mean.

So what does “woke” mean in practice?

It means “my out-group.”\
It means “the kind of person I think is judging me.”\
It means “the part of modern life that irritates or scares me.”\
It means “a shortcut around thinking.”

That’s why arguing about it is usually a waste of time unless you force specificity.

If someone says “woke,” the only useful reply is basically: cool, which thing, exactly? And do you actually disagree with the underlying idea, or just with the way you’ve seen it performed online?

Because if we don’t drag it back to actual claims, “woke” stays what it is now: a fog machine for keeping normal people mad at each other while the people with real power keep doing whatever they want.

gimme a both-sides table for this list. Where the opposing position generally agrees (like kids should be safe from abuse), just change the language, but some of these positions have genuiine disagreement on the other side (like "I don't believe climate change is caused by humans, but it would be nice if my kids had clean air and while I think over-regulation is bad, I want my kids to have  no lead in their toys")

#### You:
there's a way of looking at woke here that makes it look stupid from both sides equally, because the way we represent the antiwoke position here is that it carries a lot more nuance. We want to separate this from the extreme right (kinda fox news and further) positions, so "climate change is nonsense, let me dump my waste in the river" or "I refuse to pay taxes" and similar ridiculous positions (I'm thinking of that quote recently from that fox news host who was like 'hey, he liked young girls, but not young young girls', which has in their extreme world become a valid (and broadcastable) position, especially around all the men they're trying to find defenses for in the epstein files. Try making this a 3 column table, where all 3 can have more nuance, and we'll actually put the most nuanced position in the middle column, drop the antiwoke (as that's language of the right) and just let it be the 'reasonable' position that most people probably believe.

Stick to markdown for now so I can test/challenge the content, but we'll consider this as its own microsite webpage where people can select their preferred option, like "Are you woke or antiwoke?" and we'll just categorise most people selecting the centre as 'normal'. Mainly cos everyone likes to think they're normal, and this lets us flag extreme positions as abnormal.

It's worth noting that the 'woke' position and the 'far right' or extreme positions are not opposite (help trans people feel safe and supported is not opposite I hate trans people, for example, but there is an almost reasonable expression of even the extreme positions so people can recognise where maybe their supposed reasonable internal thought pattern actually is more extreme than they thought)

If you want this to *feel* less like “left vs right”, you can treat the left and right columns as two different failure modes: one over-moralises and over-polices; the other weaponises distrust into cruelty and denial. The middle column is where most people already live, even if they refuse to admit it out loud.


#### You:
yeah, a failure modes list might be good, essentially the same table, but instead of positions, write failure modes under the interpretation for each issue, Our 'normal people' column can probably just be fairly average but generally positive outcomes with compromises and balance.
