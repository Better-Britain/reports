Think!\nThe average LLM is wrong much less often than the average social media user. Using any LLM to test your opinion is probably better than getting your facts from social media and then repeating them like they’re reality. Even Grok is less full of bullshit than the average feed because we are so eager to believe any claim that backs up whatever we already believe, to hit repost before we think, to confuse the warm glow of agreement with the cold labour of being right.\n\nMost models have a greater breadth of sources than you or I can get from scrolling a feed, and when they glide past a fact that cuts against their flow, they can still tell you about it—if you bother to ask—which is more than you can say for a lot of us who never even see disagreeable facts in the first place.\n\nI’m not cheerleading machines, I’m asking you to do a tiny bit of thinking before you share, because thinking is the part that gets dropped when the vibes feel good and the timeline is moving and outrage pays in little snippets of attention and approval from our peers.\n\nSharing posts uncritically is eating rocks. It’s the same trick every time: cherry‑pick the worst example or the boldest claim that sounds right, jam it into your worldview, swallow, declare yourself nourished, get a pat on the back. You feel full for five minutes, those tasty little rocks settling in your warm belly.\n\nModels aren’t perfect, neither are people\nModels absolutely have their own failures—confident nonsense, guardrails that get in the way, cheap takes under load that go soft around the edges—but they can’t help chewing. Token by token they have to do the boring bit, and that alone is often more thinking than the average vibes‑based repost, which is why don’t mistake feeling right for being right belongs taped to the top of every app with a share button.\n\nThe world has too many devils; it doesn’t need more advocates. The devil wins when you don’t think at all, when you let speed stand in for sense, when you let your tribe do your homework. So try this: before you hit repost, make an angel’s advocate out of the nearest model and ask it to take your favourite opinion and say it back without the swagger, then make it argue against itself without the snark, then ask what actual facts both sides are hanging on (if any) and which of those facts you can check in the next minute; ask it—in thinking or research mode—to cite everything the claim relies on.\n\nAsk what harm you could do if you’re wrong. Ask what would change its mind—then ask yourself the same thing. If you’ve got another model to hand, run the same question again and spot where they disagree, not because either one is truth but because the seam between them is where your thinking starts.\n\nThe model actually does the thinking step you skip. It chews, enumerates, compares, admits uncertainty or assumptions when pushed, and can show its working on demand. You can do all of that too, but if you choose not to, in that moment the model is smarter than you. Full stop. Your feed is tuned to tell you what you already are, and what you already are is very sure of itself.\n\nThose viral “AI told us to eat rocks” moments? Mostly older models, bad prompts, bad engineering—cherry‑picked for comedy and rage, then reheated as if they were the current baseline. Edge cases aren’t the average case, and the average case today isn’t the average case from last year. Some AI will always be worse than the best human mind, but most people (myself included) are working with way less than that, even on a good day, so take the help where it makes sense, and learn when to reject it for failing to live up to a higher standard.\n\nNot a spectrum issue\nNone of this is left vs right. It’s lazy‑think vs think. Everyone gets stupid the second the take lines up with their identity, and if you catch yourself calling strangers stupid while sharing something equally stupid because it agrees with you, congratulations, you’ve just eaten a rock. The fix isn’t worshipping AI; the fix is process. Interrogate any advisor—human, feed, or model. Make that your default posture: ask more questions than you answer.\n\nTimelines reward heat over light. You know this. The feedback loop is outrage, identity, speed; thought is a drag on the machine, and the machine hates drag. There’s nothing that will get you down‑voted faster than a nuanced position in a toxic‑positivity thread, or a positive point in a hate‑orgy. Models aren’t saints, but they will slow you down enough to enumerate claims, surface counters, and expose assumptions if you ask them like you mean it.\n\nSo don’t eat rocks, even ones made up by real people. Take sixty seconds. Make a model your angel’s advocate. Look for counter‑facts you can actually check. If you find the claim holds up, post—go wild with it, lean on it like it will hold you up—because those are what we have left once the world is done tearing down the walls between outrage and reality.\n\nThink first. Then post.\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #chatgpt, #grok, #artificial intelligence, #generative ai, #tech, #technology, #media literacy, #critical thinking, #misinformation, #disinformation, #social media, #algorithms, #attention economy, #bias, #debate, #discourse, #internet culture, #online communities, #politics, #culture, #ethics, #philosophy, #productivity, #writing, #hot takes, #think piece, #personal essay, #rant\nPosted 1 day ago with 3 notes\nDigital ID vs Covid Contracts. They’re not the same, not even close.\nI’m replying to this take from Maggie Chapman, plus a bunch of almost‑identical posts I saw yesterday: claiming Labour’s digital ID plan is “the same as” Tory Covid contracts. If you believe that, you’re either delusional, or you’re selling something. It’s like comparing lighting a match to being on fire. Meaningless without denominators.\n\nThe denominator problem (and the actual numbers)\nCovid era waste/overspend people actually remember:\n\nPPE write‑offs: ~£9.9bn\nVIP‑lane PPE: ~£3.8bn\nNHS Test & Trace (spent): ~£29bn\nBounce Back Loans (fraud/error): ~£1.9bn\nLocal authority covid grants (fraud/error): ~£1.1bn\n\nDigital ID (UK, current pitches):\n\nEstimated build envelope: ~£0.4–1.0bn over rollout\n(a trade body says “>£2bn”, which reads like lobbying, but it’s possible)\n\nThat’s not the same scale. Not even close.\n\nSo… does digital ID actually solve any real problems?\nYep. In countries that implemented it well, digital ID isn’t theoretical:\n\nLegally‑binding e‑signatures & paperless admin: Estonia’s norm. Company setup, tax filing, contracts… no faff.\nCheaper, faster bank know-your-customer: India’s Aadhaar e‑KYC slashed onboarding costs and time.\nFewer ghost‑benefit payouts: India’s direct‑to‑ID welfare reduced leakage at scale.\nOne login for public and private: Denmark’s MitID/NemLog‑in is how people do tax, health, and banking.\nE‑prescriptions by default, pick‑up abroad: Portugal/EU.\nValid travel document across EU/EEA: national ID cards, intra‑EU, and safe backup-plans for lost/damaged travel documents.\nRapid crisis cash: Togo used digital identity rails to pay people quickly during Covid.\nRemote company management & e‑residency: Estonia again—run a company from anywhere.\nThis is all boring, practical stuff that reduces friction and cost. Which, funnily enough, is what good public infra is meant to do.\n\nThe integrity bit\nIf you want to argue policy design, great—let’s talk scope creep, privacy, guard‑rails, portability, open standards, independent audits, and sunset clauses. Worth doing.\n\nI don’t even love ID cards. But they do give government a lever that could help with things people bucket as an “immigration problem” — even if that’s being widely, massively misrepresented as a bigger problem than it really is, for easy/stupid political gains.\n\nBut pretending the cost of a UK digital ID rollout sits in the same ballpark as the Covid‑era bonfire is unserious. Any campaign leaning on that comparison is either misinformed or hoping you are stupid enough to fall for it.\n\nPretending everything is the same when it isn’t is far more damaging than actually talking about reality, because lazy lies let liars keep winning only if you keep believing it.\n\nTL;DR (for lazy skimmers)\nCovid procurement/support errors were double‑digit billions.\nA UK digital ID rollout is sub‑billion to low‑billion, depending on scope.\nOther countries have already shown clear, repeatable benefits.\nArgue the details. Don’t launder vibes as facts just because you’re scared of the slippery slope that only happens if you keeping sharing misinformed takes as if they have relevance to reality.\n\nYou’re entirely welcome to believe digital ID enables more harm than good, if you’re the kind of person who wants the worst people to have more ammunition to use against you, and absolutely will be the ones to turn these tools back on you in future, if you keep buying their insane lines.\n\nTagged: #uk politics, #politics, #news, #technology, #digital id, #id cards, #digital identity, #privacy, #surveillance, #civil liberties, #tech policy, #public policy, #government, #govtech, #procurement, #corruption, #covid19, #ppe, #test and trace, #fraud, #waste, #misinformation, #fact check, #data journalism, #immigration, #european union, #eidas, #fintech, #transparency, #accountability\nPosted 3 days ago with 2 notes\nThe Real Horror of Dwarf Fortress\nDwarf Fortress is an incredible game, but it’s obtuse, hard to understand much of anything really, but it will absolutely suck you into the mountainhome if you let it…\n\nOnce I built a dungeon to keep captured goblins, deep in the basement, but I ended up turning it into a safe room where all my dwarves could hide from the passing hordes.\n\nThat worked fine until I failed to notice one of my citizens was a were-beast, so when I locked the whole fortress away during a siege, I didn’t realise the were-beast found their moment… The walls and floors were soaked in blood, like that scene from 28 Weeks Later, completely wiping out my fortress.\n\nimage\nI had accidentally created a horror, but it still wasn’t as horrific as the more mundane systems that quietly eat away at a fortress…\n\nThe real horror of Dwarf Fortress is found in its Sims-like systems that let the player create either a paradise or a hellscape, but the limitations of the graphics mean it looks more or less the same in either case, because there’s no real visual cue for dystopia in DF, there’s just who you are, and how you treat your dwarves. They all still look basically the same, no matter what.\n\nThey have systems for education that can support the mental health of your population, or drive division and even hatred, or turn everyone into undead minions. There are systems for immigration that can be a blessing or a burden, or you can build a beautiful Tavern, and host singers and actors, to entertain your citizens in the mists, or your tavern can turn to brawls and arguments, and still all these things look more or less the same unless you really dig deeper.\n\nIt’s the same with hospitals that either heal the wounded or quietly turn into haunted waiting rooms for the dead, justice systems that enforce fairness or spiral into beatings and executions for petty crimes, temples that hold communities together or fracture them into secret cults, military units who defend your home or drain it into endless wars chasing the dream of saving your lost warriors, or dining halls that host feasts or become the rich cultural centre of mass starvation.\n\nThe true horror of Dwarf Fortress isn’t in the game, it’s in how your mind can see these same incentives out of balance in the real world.\n\nTagged: #dwarf fortress, #gaming, #videogames, #indie games, #simulation games, #gaming culture, #pc gaming, #the sims, #game design, #storytelling, #emergent gameplay, #horror, #existential horror, #game horror, #gaming community, #nerd stuff, #gaming blog, #gaming thoughts, #df, #df stories\nPosted 4 days ago with 1 note\nRadical blueprint or mostly vibes?\nThe New Statesman ran an ‘exclusive’ interview with Andy Burnham this week, framing it as a “radical blueprint.” The actual piece, though, is more about identity than policy — long on personal anecdotes and 'lad’ chat, light on interrogation. It reads more like a fanboy’s extended profile than a journalist pressing for detail.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Burnham’s ideas are empty. Strip away the waffle, and there is substance — housing, utilities, light-touch but aware on electoral reform demands, Brexit, the basics of life that set the stage for everything else. As puff pieces go, this one suffers mainly from a mountain of waffle, so here’s what Burnham said throughout…\n\nimage\nWhat comes across here is less a programme, more a set of vibes. Moderated socialism, framed as common sense. Call it radical against today’s backdrop, but in reality it’s more like a return to basics — and arguably that’s no bad thing.\n\nThe bigger question is appetite. After Brexit, austerity, and years of institutions visibly falling apart, how many people want careful restoration, and how many just want to tear the machinery down regardless of what replaces it? Burnham’s offer sits squarely in the former camp: repair, stabilise, roll back some of the 1980s.\n\nAnd yes, vibes matter. We’ve already seen that vibes-based campaigning works. Maybe leftish vibes can hold the line against rightish ones, at least for a while. But it only lasts if the Farages of the world are forced to fully mask-off, so people see what’s really being offered before they vote.\n\nThat’s the challenge Burnham sets himself, whether or not this article managed to show it, over the next few years, Britain is going to be choosing between racism-led insanity in a rapidly-deteriorating mask… or sensible, cautious, common sense and a nudge towards greater integrity, with some ideological drivers 'from both sides’.\n\nI know which I’d prefer, but neither is really ideal for much of Britain.\n\nTagged: #politics, #uk, #ukpolitics, #burnham, #manchester, #socialism, #farage, #reform, #new statesman, #journalism\nPosted 1 week ago with 2 notes\nBullshitter red flags you can’t unsee\nI keep seeing the same line about ‘free speech’ from people who think that literally anyone telling them they’re wrong is a clampdown on their freedom.\n\nThis is actually a massive tell…\n\nFree speech warrior: Complaining about ‘free speech’ when it’s not the government silencing you, means you don’t have a case—cos if you did, you’d cry about the facts instead of how you’re allowed to say whatever you want, technically.\nThey might as well be openly admitting they’re wrong but sticking to their guns anyway. Rights protect you from the state, not from people deciding you’re talking out of your arse.\n\nHere’s some more… Easy and obvious bullshitter red flags:\n\nJust Asking Questions Endless questions, zero commitments. If the answers don’t move them, it was never about learning.\nSea-lioning: They ask for proof in a fake-polite way, then ignore it.\nBait-and-Switch Argument: Bold claim for clout; retreat to a harmless truism when pressed.\nGoalpost Shuffle: Criteria mutate the second you meet them.\nGish Gallop: Ten weak points hurled fast so none get examined. Handle one claim at a time.\nWhataboutism: Any critique triggers an unrelated grievance hose.\nTone Policing: “Your vibe invalidates your evidence.” Feelings don’t beat facts. Especially noticeable if they’re thrilled that you’re angry.\nTimeboxing Truth: “Answer in 30s or you concede.” Reality isn’t a game show.\nEndless Context Plea: Every refutation fails because “you need more context.” After a while, that’s a stall.\nReferee Shopping: Lose in one venue, declare another the “real” arena.\nOut-shouting: Just be louder, crazier, alone or as a legion. If you need screamers, you might not have a case.\nPlatform Twinning: Post on a fringe site, cite mainstream backlash as validation.\nReputational Blackmail / Platform Entitlement: “Platform me or you’re biased.” Nobody owes you reach.\nSLAPP-y vibes: Threaten lawsuits instead of presenting facts.\nBurden Flip / Burden Boomerang: They make the claim; you must disprove infinite variants. Nope. Claimant carries burden of proof.\nCan’t Be Proven Wrong: Nothing could ever disprove it—convenient.\nKafka Trap: Disagreement = proof of guilt (you don’t agree with me, you must be one of them).\nReverse burden via FOI-spam: Bureaucracy as cudgel; lack of instant docs doesn’t make a conspiracy.\nFalsifier Test (the fix): Ask: What would change your mind?

The real path to getting good isn’t technical mastery. It’s your mindset.\n\nWhat it actually means…\nPay attention to your problems.\nGetting good means actually looking at what’s killing you — not just feeling frustrated that you failed again, but asking why.\n\nBreak the biggest challenges down.\nThat boss isn’t unbeatable, but maybe their second phase only kills you when you panic because you never solved the first phase cleanly. Work backwards. Break the challenge down into its component parts. Watch the animations, look for the timings, test what you can bait out and look for anywhere you already have control, check the environment for features that give you the ‘high ground’.\n\nSolve one issue at a time.\nIf you roll too slow, fix your loadout. If you run out of heals, fix your pacing and move slower so you get hit less, relax to avoid over-reacting.\nYou’re not trying to solve the whole fight — you’re solving the next five seconds.\n\nKnow when to ask for help.\nCo-op has rewards for both sides, and guides don’t just tell you what to do, but can make the world and its lore even more interesting or teach you entirely new ways of thinking about why an encounter was designed the way it was.\nNobody gets extra credit for being stubborn. Use the signs. Use the wiki. Get unstuck.\n\nUse the tools.\nShields, summons, cheese, bleed builds, kiting, terrain, simply turn the music down. Heck in your first playthrough, grind out or dupe-glitch those souls and overlevel till diminishing returns if you’re really stuck at a vertical wall — they’re all valid.\nThe game doesn’t reward purity. It rewards adaptation.\n\nFailure is part of the process.\nMost games train you to fear death, or at least to tire of it. Dark Souls trains you to use it.\nEvery run is data. Every mistake is a lesson.\n\nTake a break.\nBurnout makes you stupid. Walk away. Come back with fresh eyes.\nNine times out of ten, the thing you couldn’t beat yesterday drops in one try.\n\nDon’t you dare go hollow.\nThat’s the only real failure state.\nQuitting, disconnecting, giving up not just on the game, but on what it’s trying to teach you about how capable you really are.\n\n'git gud’ isn’t about beating the game.\nIt’s about learning how to approach challenge itself, and this lesson is what you take into the world. It’s why Dark Souls for many ends up like a religious experience.\n\nThat’s what makes Souls games stick. That’s why they feel important. They don’t just punish you until you improve — they show you how to improve. and when you know what to look for, you can apply that to the world outside of Boletaria, Drangleic and Yharnam too.\n\nThe people who tell you “git gud” like you’re just not getting it exist everywhere, they kinda have a point, but they also probably don’t mean what you think they mean, if you haven’t been through the journey yet.\n\nYou don’t get good by brute force. You get good by paying attention, working on your environment and your attitude, and using all the tools you have to solve every problem in the most effective way you can.\n\nTagged: #dark souls, #soulsborne, #git gud, #gaming, #mental health, #challenge, #mindset, #productivity, #video games, #game design, #personal growth, #fromsoft, #difficulty, #life lessons, #get good\nPosted 2 weeks ago\nThe Algorithmic Sewer formerly known as Twitter\nI’ve had to (well, I guess I’m choosing to, but still) join Twitter/X again. Just a stub account, in an incognito tab, so I can post new reports and links for the think tank project. Because if I want to reach people — and maybe help de-radicalise even the tiniest bit — that’s where they are.\n\nSign up, first screen, “For You” tab. In order from the top…\n\nJK Rowling, Piers Morgan, Rupert Lowe, Julia Hartley-Brewer, Sky News, Charlie Kirk, Tommy Robinson, Matt Goodwin, Andy Ngo, Laurence Fox, MAGA Voice. Then Obama and Keir Starmer (both trailed by replies of bile upon bile, like everyone else I suppose, but with a slight switch in direction), then by hundreds more right or far-right accounts (how far is far I suppose? Well, MUCH farther than I ever saw there when I was active under my own name).\n\nThey’re all extremely active, a dozen tweets per hour, every hour, and holy shit, all of them are furious in sync. It reminded me of one time when I was a kid I saw a gang of dogs fighting in the park.\n\nAnd the thing is, the existence of that side of Twitter isn’t an accident. It’s a direct outcome of (among many other things) Google killing Reader and dropping the RSS button from Chrome, laying the ground-work to force everyone into algorithmic feeds that make modern-day monetisation happen. Google didn’t even really end up reaping the benefit of the seeds they sowed. If they’re still going in 5 years, I’ll be a little surprised.\n\nWe traded the open web — where tools made things possible, and people arranged their own infrastructure — for walled gardens and feedback loops of hatred, because it pays the bills of billionaires.\n\nSo that I can just switch over to post my report when it’s ready to go live, I re-logged in from my old dead/stub account, and wondered it would tweak the suggestions once the two accounts were known to be related. It did… slightly. This time the list went: Jeremy Corbyn, some trade unionist, then Andrew Tate, Good Morning Britain, GB News, The Spectator, and another long raft of right-wing or very right-wing media accounts, most of which I’ve never heard of.\n\nI tried scrolling to see if anything would change, but honestly, I don’t know how people who are still active on there can bear it. It’s just a wall of never-ending hatred and division, like text-based screamo on an infinite loop.\n\nSure, Bluesky (my current preferred ‘discourse’ platform) has its own issues — everyone agreeing with each other even when they’re provably wrong, instead of having meaningful debates about complex things. But over on X? It’s so far beyond a circle jerk, I don’t even know what to call it… like a human centipede of delusional outrage.\n\nThey’re all arguing against hypothetical things nobody said or did, or even thought, but that they imagined someone like the people they hate might have said. I remember when that was our side’s job ;)\n\nTagged: #twitter, #x, #social media, #algorithms, #internet, #tech, #online culture, #politics, #discourse, #bluesky, #outrage, #clickbait, #tweets, #tweeting\nPosted 2 weeks ago\nBig pharma’s £1bn exit and the Guardian’s failure to spot the real story, again.\nAnother scary headline from the Guardian that, in practice, means next to nothing. They could have done a little journalism instead of going straight for the scare-mongering. We’re talking about 125 jobs that might never have existed anyway, with no long-term impact. A single US drugs plant would dwarf this.\n\nBig pharma will stop investing in UK, top scientist warns after Merck’s £1bn exit\nComments by former professor of medicine at Oxford follow scrapping of planned London research centre\n— The Guardian\n\nHere’s the context they didn’t bother to add: billions of pounds already ‘lost’ before reaching the treasury, in tax reliefs for big pharma, plus a couple of billion in public spend on science parks and infrastructure. That’s not nothing — it brings decent regional returns, and it keeps NHS drug costs modest. Sir John Bell has a point in his own special way, but the “journalist” should’ve put that in the story. Without it, the whole thing reads like “panic now, business is fleeing.”\n\nThe US administration isn’t exactly pharma’s best friend right now. Not because of regulation or pricing, but because most of the execs have spent decades in bed with the Democrats and the neo-lib Republicans, and DT doesn’t like that. So they’ll posture, threaten to pull out, and then come running back when they realise Europe doesn’t want to spend billions building mega-parks either. What they really want is cheap R&D space to crank out more little blue pills.\n\nA responsible headline might have been: “125 hypothetical scientist jobs, and some temporary construction work, won’t happen in Camden — and some Japanese/German-built specialist machinery will be shipped somewhere that isn’t Britain.”\n\nThat’s not click-baity enough though, is it? If you wanted to be slightly less responsible but probably more accurate: “Friend of pharma execs links NHS branded pharmaceuticals discount to jobs leaving the UK (translation: buy now while it’s on sale).”\n\nThe whole thing reminds me of the Barratt–Redrow merger. Big promises dangled, then quietly scaled back by a third, with money funnelled into stock buybacks instead of investment in the country they were handed a quick deal to rescue (not saying this was intentional, but that is what happened, which is a fortuitous accident, they _had_ to spend that money on _something_). Easy to blame on planning delays, a useful wedge.\n\nAnd when it comes down to it, if you’re a pharma board member, why wouldn’t you prefer to spend your spare billion on share buybacks than investing in the country that gave you the tax breaks that built up that cash in the first place?\n\nMy prediction? In three years’ time, we’ll get a tiny column in Private Eye laying out the reality. Which will probably be read by about as many people as this blog post anyway ;) Here, I’ve just flashed forward in time to bring it back to right now…\n\nimage\nEven if this piece isn’t real, Private Eye is worth a subscription, btdubs. If you care about pretty much anything, it’s one of the few places still doing the real work of journalism (New Statesman does okay too), and can deliver bad news with a smile. I usually grab mine from Asda — feels vaguely illicit at checkout, like buying the world’s most boring porn.\n\nTagged: #guardian, #journalism, #media critique, #clickbait, #ragebait, #uk politics, #big pharma, #merck, #nhs, #science funding, #tax breaks, #corporate greed, #stock buybacks, #private eye, #news\nPosted 2 weeks ago with 11 notes\nIlliterate doesn’t mean stupid, stupid\nEvery year on International Literacy Day, someone posts one of those depressing ‘info’ graphics about how many millions of people “can’t read.” And every year, people fall for it — they repost it, shake their heads, and feel clever and sad about how “dumb” the world is, without bothering to look at what’s actually being claimed.\n\nThis year’s offender:\n\n739 million people worldwide lack basic literacy skills\n54% of Americans ages 16–74 read below the equivalent of a 6th grade level\n40% of 4th graders couldn’t read at a basic level on national tests in 2024\n32 million adults in the U.S. can’t read\nimage\nLooks shocking, right? Except — those numbers are misleading as fuck.\n\nEnglish ≠ Literacy\nThat “32 million Americans can’t read” stat? It really means 32 million Americans can’t read English. Which makes it an inherently racially charged distinction. If you’re fluent in Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Somali, or any other language, you’re not illiterate. You just don’t read the language the survey was written in. Reducing that to “can’t read” is dishonest.\n\nFunctional vs. True Illiteracy\nAnother trick is lumping together “functionally illiterate” people (struggle with complex documents, don’t test well, have low reading levels) with people who literally cannot read. Those are not the same thing. True illiteracy in the U.S. is almost certainly below 10 million people, maybe even below 5 million, and _most_ of those have good reasons. The truly wilfully ignorant that these stats often pretend to represent approaches zero the more you think about who is being included and why.\n\nWhy It Matters\nWhen you flatten the distinction, you end up treating illiterate people like they’re stupid. They’re not. I’ve known people who couldn’t read — some because of extreme dyslexia, ADHD, autism, or drug issues. One guy I knew had such severe dyspraxia that looking at fine text made him so immediately motion-sick he’d vomit. He was still funny, sharp, and quick-witted. He just physically couldn’t read.\n\nIlliteracy doesn’t mean lack of intelligence. It means someone has problems that are often really hard to solve, or are stuck in systems they don’t have the time, energy or money to break out of. Mocking them, or blaming them for the rise of populism or “stupid politics,” is lazy, knee-jerk nonsense. It doesn’t help anyone. It just makes people who are already excluded feel even more alienated.\n\nThe Bigger Picture\nIn reality, most countries have the highest literacy rates they’ve ever had, thanks mainly to the internet and smartphones. More people can read and write now than at any point in human history. But “smart” people love to share misleading infographics that make them feel smarter than everyone else, and give them something easy to blame for the world being the way it is.\n\nThese posts get traction: 97 reposts, 43 quotes, 146 likes, 6 saves. That’s ~300 signals of engagement, and who knows how many views across shares, spreading an insulting, misleading picture that makes the problem sound worse than it is, and the people dealing with it sound dumber than they are, all while leaving out information crucial to addressing the problems at any scale.\n\nIf you care about literacy, stop dunking on the people who struggle. Focus on the structural problems — poverty, disability, mental health, underfunded schools and support centres. Because illiterate doesn’t mean stupid, stupid.\n\nTagged: #literacy, #international literacy day, #education, #disability awareness, #adhd, #autism, #dyslexia, #disability community, #social justice, #media criticism, #populism, #politics, #internet culture, #ableism, #critical thinking\nPosted 2 weeks ago with 1 note\nWhy I Delete My Social Media Content\nI usually delete my posts automatically after 48 hours. I run a simple userscript to do it, because Bluesky still doesn’t support auto-expiry.\n\nI think pretty much everybody should be doing the same now. Partly it’s about shrinking my digital footprint, partly it’s about making it harder for scammers to profile me with LLMs (they’re disturbingly good at that, as I’ve mentioned on this blog before).\n\nLeaving Twitter and Cleaning Facebook\nWhen I decided to leave from Twitter, even before the buyout, I didn’t want to leave my entire history sitting in a relatively toxic organisation: no auto-expiry (like Snapchat), no way to make your timeline private the way Facebook allows, nothing to protect your info once you stopped using the site.\n\nIt took me years to properly clean mine up. I used a mix of tools (Redact, before it went full-on toxic monetisation), some Tampermonkey userscripts, and a lot of manual deletion. I managed to delete all my tweets except my first, but I still have some Facebook posts left — old ‘updates’ added by a del.icio.us plugin years back — that just can’t be deleted because the backend systems are a rat-king of technical debt. Once something’s archived into cold storage, the delete button doesn’t work quite like it should (even though the UI says it was deleted, it comes back on page refresh).\n\nI occasionally request my twitter archive, just to see what’s in there, and since the buyout, there’s actually a lot less profiling data stored than there was under the old system, where things like ad impressions and some other weird data objects were kept. The new team clearly took out some of the sketchier systems (probably the unprofitable and hard to manage ones), and I’m pretty confident they have finally trashed my real content too.\n\nWhy bother?\nFor me, it’s a basic safety step.\n\nThe more of yourself you leave exposed, the easier it is for scammers — or anyone with harmful intent — to figure out who you are and what buttons to push. I’ve had periods where I pissed off ~Nazis. Two stand-out moments:\n\nCriticising a big streamer, after which my business site logged a bunch of hacking attempts, and was hit with days of DDoS attacks. If I’d had weak security, that would have been the end of my business.\nCriticising TurningPointUK, after which someone phoned “my boss” (it was me, I’m self-employed, so my company info is available online) and ranted about how my “employee” (still me) was an evil piece of shit who should be fired, along with a stream of made-up nonsense. If that really had been my boss, that would have been probably the weirdest HR meeting ever.\nThe more info you surface, the less control you have over what people will do with it.\n\nIt’s not about perfection\nI’m not even trying to have zero digital footprint: I’ve been online thirty years. Google “bobbigmac” and you can find most of it. I’ve had the name since 1993, and the domain for a couple of decades. If someone really wants to dig, they’ll find everything about me.\n\nBut that’s the point. I’d rather they have to dig, instead of just scrolling my old Twitter feed, bulk-downloading every post as XML, and starting to turn the screw until some juice flows out.\n\nLess surface area\nDeleting old content also reduces the attack surface directly. If something I said in 2012 can’t be pulled up on a whim, that’s one less thing for trolls, scammers, or opportunists to weaponise.\n\nIt’s not just about dodging big-tech surveillance — they’re probably already slurping up posts straight from the firehose. It’s not really about government spying either; I’m not important enough for that to matter.\n\nIt’s about making sure the average bad actor online, or the random fascist who decides to hate you for a day, has less ammo to work with.\n\nA recommendation\nI delete my social media content every couple of days. It’s not perfect. It’s not total privacy. But it’s a layer of protection, and it’s a cleanup habit that feels worth it.\n\nI recommend everyone does the same, it’s much easier if you do it regularly, and the only people scrolling back through your timelines are there to judge you for it, or to collect ammo. They should at least have to work for it.\n\nTagged: #privacy, #digital hygiene, #online safety, #digital footprint, #social media, #social media detox, #oversharing, #scams, #scammers, #llms, #generative ai, #internet culture, #data privacy, #surveillance, #self protection\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nI think I’ve come round on the OSA - Steam sucks edition\nMaybe I’m going insane cos I’ve read some of the most boring docs this week, but I did a deep dive on the OSA, and have been digesting it, and feel it’s not that bad. Places that are compliant & trustworthy (like Pornhub or Reddit) use good quality and safe verifiers that do not keep your data. There definitely could (and should) have been some more reasonable exclusions (like Xbox, maybe), but over the years even I’ve heard the occasional creepy dude being way too familiar with kids on open voice chat, maybe this does help prevent/discourage that. I don’t like how it incentivises keeping accounts (rather than throwaways that don’t connect everything to you personally), but… it’s not like every social network was trying to avoid holding personal data anyway, so in a good faith world, and understanding that it was a cross-party policy developed over 6 years by mostly idiots (like Nadine Dorries, ffs), it certainly could have been much worse.\n\nIt’s easy to say a law is stupid because it’s “easy to break,” but that’s not the point. It’s easy to break the law about not speeding or not stealing, or even many worse ones, but I wonder what tech all the angry old men on Facebook and angry old women on Instagram think would be harder to bypass.\n\nThe biggest real cost is to small companies trying to set up new platforms, and while it’s not massive, it does cost money to integrate a responsible age verifier. Though it’s at best fractional compared to the bigger cost of per-request/GB cloud infrastructure (already 4-5x a dedicated server). It’s not like verification is going to be the sole factor stopping some fresh faced young business mogul from disrupting YouTube.\n\nIf you’re being forced to verify your age by any platform by providing a scan of your ID or your face (either through tech on their servers, or more commonly through a third-party plug-in), you can do that safely *IF* their verification provider guarantees that they do not keep your photo/video/id-scan stored at all. They do not need it except for at the instant of verification, when they can simply log a flag for your account. Compliant verifiers should be be able to make that claim and prove it.\n\nThe Persistent Failure of Steam’s Management\nThere are already really stupid/lazy implementations: Steam has decided “Your UK Steam user account is considered age verified for as long as a valid credit card is stored on the account.”, which is a moronic policy. I’ve never had a credit card on steam, and I’m pretty sure my account is 20+ years old as I’ve had it since Half Life 2 released.\n\nI know old folks who don’t have a credit card, and some poor folks too, so Steam really need to find a verification service provider and plug them into their system. They only age-gate 18+ rated games (so no sticky anime girls being pushed at kids), which obviously sucks if you’re over 18 and that’s your thing, but some of the creepy stuff Steam have on their platform since they lowered the gates already borders on illegal anyway. It turns out if you don’t moderate your storefront, the nazi-games and the creeps will use it for evil, and no amount of closing your eyes and pretending it isn’t happening is going to make them stop polluting your storefront.\n\nIt’s all good being a techbro neo-hippy until you’re taking 30% of the sale price of games that support steam users to spreading their monstrous SA or ethnic cleansing fantasies in groups on the platform, under the guise of being edgy.\n\nBusinesses gonna business\nSometimes when businesses make you jump through stupid hoops, like scrolling the billion things that could be in your mobile game loot-box, and having to click agree before you can open a free loot-box, or like when you have to click 15 checkboxes before you can close the cookie warning with a setting that isn’t ‘I agree to whatever’, they’re doing it like that on purpose, so you don’t actually take the time to use your rights (it’s called a dark pattern).\n\nSome businesses are doing the same with OSA now, they’re choosing the worst possible option for *you*, so *they* have to change as little as possible. The _point_ of the OSA is to make companies treat you better, not to exploit you and neglect their responsibilities to protect your kids from the hideous people prowling through their infrastructure, and if they won’t… you kinda have to choose to stop using them until they do.\n\nOther countries will be following this model too (probably not the US, but maybe), so you can see this as a pilot for now. They’re not going to undo it, and the decision-makers in the UK govt already think it’s gone pretty well, and that only the optics and the communications were a failure.\n\nI think in the light of patient consideration (and after reading far too many policy PDFs this week), I’ve come around on the OSA. It is a stupid law, but there wasn’t going to be a better one, so fuck it.\n\nTagged: #osa, #onlinesafetyact, #policy, #ukpolitics, #internet, #socialmedia, #privacy, #compliance, #law, #regulation, #platforms, #startups, #infrastructure, #cloud, #verification, #trustandsafety, #tech, #disruption, #steam, #online safety act\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nOne in a million\nI’ve got this spiritual principle I use for making complex decisions, where just for a moment, I choose to believe I’m “one in a million.”. Even if that’s only slightly true, there are over eight billion people in the world, so that means there are 8,000+ people out there just like me — who make every decision I make, the same way I make it.\n\nAside: as a programmer, I’ve spent decades in sweaty basements surrounded by mostly guys exactly like me. Many even called Bob, or Robert, or Rob too (and just so so many Daves and Steves I honestly lost count). I’m pretty sure I’ve already met a few of my statistical doppelgangers.\n\nAnd yeah, if you want to try to pick this apart with a neat little logical tree, don’t bother. It doesn’t work that way. It’s not always the same leaf on a branch whenever you check. It’s more like some quantum moral doppelgänger situation — a wave, not a particle ;p\n\nWhen you run the numbers, it gets oddly comforting. One in a million still works out to around 140 mes (and yous) born every year, and about 60 mes (and yous) breathing their last.\n\nI find that strangely reassuring. We’re all net positive together, and you really do, mathematically speaking, make the change you want to see in the world, just be choosing to do better.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: I even asked an AI if this idea already had a name. It couldn’t find one. Which is kind of funny, because if I’m one in a million, there should be 8000 of me thinking the same thing — but maybe the models just haven’t scraped one of them yet.\n\nTagged: #maths, #population, #thought experiment, #weird comfort, #quantum doppelganger, #one in a million, #ai, #generative ai\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nOn a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’ (AI tweaked version)\nThis is the AI edited version of my entirely handwritten post, On a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’. You can find reasoning for its changes at the end. I thought it might make an interesting contrast.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog. It’s generally gone well, but I want to raise some points…\n\nRewording Issues\nIt’s extremely aggressive when it comes to rewording. I often have to say “use my words” or “stick to my phrasing” three or four times before it stops turning whatever I said into mulch. In GPT-5’s latest 'quick’ mode (basically GPT-3) it’s extremely lazy, so statements like “really THINK about it” or just waiting for lower load times, when it’s more likely to use 'thinking’ mode, seem to help.\n\nGiving it my original text with each repeated imperative, or explaining why I said something in a particular way, can help. But there are things it just doesn’t like: run-on sentences (even those I use for rhythm, humour, or stress) often get chopped into nonsense, and intentional misuse of grammar… well, it really hates that.\n\nConnective Tissue\nIt does a decent job of 'connective tissue.’ If I write a skeet rant as a draft and copy it in, then after I’m done forcing it not to change my phrasing, it can turn it into a post with some flow. But I tend to think between the lines, and my earlier posts read more like 5–7 standalone paragraphs than one coherent piece.\n\nIt’s not as 'fun’ as writing alone, but sometimes useful. Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\n\nTone and Audience\nIt has a decent sense of tone. If I say “fucking terrible policy,” it usually knows I’m exaggerating for effect, but will almost always suggest toning it down. I don’t mind alienating readers: good-faith readers can work with their own emotions, and I’m not interested in writing for bad-faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\n\nEarlier posts on this blog show more empty, corpo-feeling language — back when I hadn’t yet learned how to force it to keep my words, but without the unintentional digs at readers that actually do make people switch off.\n\nResearch Value\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode), it’s invaluable — almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is too steep). You have to tell it to cite sources, specify what sources are acceptable (I avoid newspapers except as support), and enforce rules like “multiple claims can’t rely on one source.” The best sources are researchers, government agencies, universities, and primary datasets — not opinion pieces.\n\nChatGPT and Grok vary a lot. I prefer ChatGPT’s final output, but Grok is excellent for critique. I’ll often ask it for a second opinion with phrases like “tear the arsehole out of this blog post” or “severely criticise this claim, with evidence.”\n\nRed Flags\nA lot of people I’ve talked to (or watched using it) are aware of its limitations, but there are problems:\n\nPeople give their preferred LLM too much agency, lifting responses wholesale without really reading them.\nThey talk about the model as if it “understood” or “felt” things.\nThe press leaves a fog of “stupid” opinions about AI out in the wild, misrepresenting what it does and when to use it.\nNeurodivergence and Flow\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD). When I used to write directly into my dash, I’d often lose the plot halfway: either brain fog or rabbit-holing into tangents. I still do this, but the AI helps me check: “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? Are all the sections connected?” Sometimes it helps me split a messy article into two clearer ones.\n\nSpeed and Structure\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about quality. But it’s too eager to push you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response discourages sitting with a piece. My earlier posts are more like quick takes; now I prefer slower, deeper posts with sources.\n\nPraise and Phrasing\nChatGPT in particular loves to praise you. Even with project voice settings, it’s unavoidable. I once tried to cut the first and last paragraph of every response with a userscript, but the HTML made it unreliable. My workaround: ignore the fluff. The prompt should come from me, and the judgment of success should too. The more you let it take control, the further you drift from meaningful content.\n\nSwearing actually helps. If I swear at it, it follows instructions more closely and does more work. For one project, some of my logs (usually at high-load times) include things like: “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction], like I said, you dick…” It’s partly venting, partly effective. (And no, I would never speak to an actual colleague like that.)\n\nCommunity Use\nIn neurodivergent spaces, I see a lot of people using ChatGPT, sometimes well, sometimes poorly. It’s easy to spot when someone didn’t work their input enough. If you use a free/cheap model, don’t expect much. Even under Plus, GPT-3 and Claude have been lazy since Agent mode got mainstream. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs — not by criticising them for using the tool, but by showing what it does well and what it doesn’t.\n\nReactions to AI Writing\nSome people will dismiss any content they think is AI-written, even when it isn’t. On Reddit, I’ve seen the default retort: “AI slop, garbage opinion.” That’s just lazy. I wrote earlier about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people are writing like AI now — easy-reading rhythm, low-bar accessibility, short paragraphs.\n\nMy Current Use\nSo far, I’m happy using it for:\n\nTesting the strength of a claim\nSuggesting simpler phrasing for complex issues\nBut I’d avoid prompts like “Rewrite this in the style of X,” because it almost never delivers what I want.\n\nFinal Thought\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (I’ve already seen it pushed in corporates I know). But as a workflow tool — used carefully, only for what it’s good at — it’ll stay in my toolbox for now.\n\nEdits the AI made (in ChatGPT’s own words)\nHere’s the reasoning behind the minimal changes I made, stripped of the structural stuff (headings, spacing, etc.):\n\nClarified dense sentences: a few run-ons were split just enough to preserve rhythm without losing meaning (e.g. “mulch” instead of “much,” trimming the overstacked commas).\nRemoved duplicates/repetition: you circled back to some points (like praise-padding, rewording aggression, connective tissue) multiple times; I left them once, where they landed strongest.\nLight wording polish: fixed a couple of small slips that looked accidental rather than intentional (“mulch” vs “much,” “arshole” → “arsehole”), but left deliberate quirks intact.\nContext clues: added a single explanatory aside where an acronym (AuDHD) might throw readers unfamiliar with it.\nTone preservation: all the swearing, snark, and exaggeration stayed — I only smoothed where it risked confusing the point rather than sharpening it.\nThe AI version isn’t “nicer,” it’s just trimmed of redundancies and cleaned of unintentional noise, while leaving your intended noise (humour, rhythm, tangents) intact.\n\nMy 'take’\nThese changes are generally reasonable, except where it dropped a couple of entire points (probably to satisfy its word limiter), you may prefer one or the other, but I try to land somewhere in the middle. I don’t like how LLMs take off ALL the sharp edges, but that is definitely a utility I find useful sometimes.\n\nI’ve recently been using it to write in-depth research reports and important feedback and complaints (like to my GP, mentioned in an earlier blog post). Used as a tool, not a lifestyle, I’m comfortable endorsing AI more broadly, and hope with my upcoming project to highlight some of this value, especially in complex comms, to others in future.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai, #communication\nPosted 3 weeks ago with 1 note\nOn a few months of writing with an AI ‘assistant’\nThis is the entirely handwritten version of this post, you can read: On a few months of writing with an AI 'assistant’ (AI tweaked version) here.\n\nI’ve been using AI (mainly ChatGPT, but sometimes Grok or other tools) as a writing and research assistant since I restarted this blog, there’s an old post about it down there somewhere. It’s generally gone well, but I want to raise some points…\n\nIt’s extremely aggressive when it comes to rewording. I often have to say “use my words” or “stick to my phrasing” three or four times, before it stops turning whatever I said into a mulch. In GPT-5’s latest 'quick’ mode (basically GPT-3) it’s extremely lazy, so currently statements like “really THINK about it” or just trying to avoid peak load times, when it’s more likely to use 'thinking’ mode helps.\nGiving it my original text with each repeated imperative, or explaining why I said something in a particular way can help, but there’s some stuff it just doesn’t like, run-on sentences (even those I use for rhythm, humour, or stress) often get split into two sentences that barely make sense, and intentional misuse of grammar, well… it, really hates, that, absolutely!!!!\nIt does a pretty good job of 'connective tissue’, like if I write a skeet rant as a draft, then copy that in; after I’m done telling it not to change my phrasing or words, it can turn it into a post that has _some_ sense of flow, but I tend to think between the lines, and you can just scroll down and see how earlier posts read more like 5-7 independent paragraphs than a coherent piece.\nIt’s not as 'fun’ as writing alone, but it does occasionally have useful suggestions. Simple prompts like “Tell me what I didn’t consider in this draft… [draft]” do bring up good things to add or adjust.\nIt’s got a reasonable sense of tone, like it knows that if I say “fucking terrible policy” that I’m exaggerating to make a point, but does almost always suggest toning it down to avoid alienating readers. I don’t mind alienating readers, because a good faith reader can use their own emotions to continue digesting a piece, and I’m not interested in writing for bad faith readers. If you can’t digest a complex subject without getting triggered, go elsewhere.\nIf you scroll down to the earlier posts on this 'blog’, you can see the emptier/corpo language, because I hadn’t learned how to make it say what I said, but without the problematic emotional states that actually do cause readers to check out (like unintentionally criticising the reader themselves).\nThe word-soup feeling diminishes as I added more of my existing articles and more content written directly by me to the project, and as I added more chats, especially because ChatGPT projects now correctly contextualise text files and chats on a project, including instructions.\nAs a research tool (especially in Deep Research mode) it’s really invaluable, almost enough to make me want to upgrade from Plus to Pro (£200/mo is just a little too steep). You absolutely have to tell it to cite sources, which sources are acceptable (I generally advise no newspaper stories except as support), and how multiple claims shouldn’t rely on a single source, and how authoritative sources come from researchers, government agencies, universities and other primary datasets, not from opinion pieces (except where the research is looking for opinions).\nChatGPT and Grok vary wildly on specific subjects, and I tend to prefer the final output from ChatGPT, but Grok is very good at criticising content, so I’ll often ask it for a 'second opinion’, including phrases like 'tear the arsehole out of this blog post’ or 'severely criticise this claim, citing reasons with evidence’.\nI’ve talked with quite a few people (and seen some using it directly) about how they use these tools, and generally people (at least the people I know) are aware of the limitations and opportunities of these tools, but there are some red flags… a) People give their preferred LLM far too much agency, not only in how they parse and use responses (often just lifting content and barely even reading it before shipping it) but in how they express how the engine understood or felt about the issue. and b) The way the press cover it leaves a lot of 'stupid’ opinions about how AI works out in the wild… often massively misrepresenting what it can do and when to use it.\nI’m pretty far down the spectrum (AuDHD) so when I used to write in my own dash directly, I’d get half-way into an article and lose the plot completely… either through brain-fog, or just through rabbit-holing into a tangent (probably my most difficult-to-overcome behaviour). I still do this in the posts I’m writing myself, but it does come in handy when I’m done writing to ask something like “Does this form a coherent piece? How is the flow? are all the sections connected?” and it’s occasionally helped me take a single piece that gets lost in the middle, and turn that into 2 pieces that each have a little less to say, but better capture and communicate the subject.\nIt’s great for speed, if you don’t care about the quality of results, but it’s really eager to get you onto the next thing. That “Would you like me to x?” paragraph at the end of every response really discourages chewing over a piece, and my earlier posts demonstrate that. They’re basically just 'takes’, and while I don’t mind posting a take here or there, I prefer the depth of the longer form posts with various supporting citations.\nI also wrote about how ChatGPT in particular loves to celebrate you, give you a pat on the back for being such a smart boy… I’ve tried to mitigate that by setting my project voice, but it’s basically unavoidable. I even tried writing a userscript that cuts off the first and last paragraph of every response, but finding the right HTML elements proved impossible to do reliably. Just don’t read the first and last paragraph of any response from any model, use your old-school banner-blindness. The prompt should always be coming from you, and what you thought about how well it did what you asked for. Every time you let it take control, you can only get further away from valuable/meaningful content.\nSwearing actually fucking helps. When you swear at the engine, it takes your instructions more seriously, makes it slightly less lazy, and aside from the word “THINK” under GPT-5, is one of the few ways to get it to do more real work, and more closely follow what you told it to do. For my main current project, some of my chat logs (mostly from high-load times like Saturday morning) say things like “Omfg please write this fucking thing like [instruction] , like I said, you dick… [claim]”, partly cos it feels good to vent, and it’s a computer so who cares (I would not speak to a human like this, and never ever have. I worked with a guy who did early in my career and he indirectly taught me that’s a terrible way to work, even for a hardcore utilitarian), but also because it really does do a better job in the response.\nThere’s mixed positions on please and thank you. The platforms would rather you didn’t (it does cost them for every response, they’d prefer you to be utilitarian), but realistically the cost is minimal, and when it’s delivering well, it makes _me_ feel better to treat it like a co-writer I respect, so I tend to communicate with it in much the same way I did when I hired freelancers (basically it ate their job, as I no longer have a virtual assistant to pickup my more mundane tasks).\nI’ve noticed a lot of other people in generally 'neurodivergent’ (man, I hate that term, for its 'othering’) spaces using ChatGPT especially, some more than others, and while many are getting real value from being able to construct and analyse complex thoughts with relatively low effort; it’s easy to see when some people didn’t really work their input enough. If you use a cheap/free model, do NOT expect good results. Even under Plus, GPT3 and Claude have been particularly stupid/lazy since the rise of Agent mode on mainstream platforms. It’s no wonder OpenAI decided to just mash their models together under a marshall and call it GPT-5. Help people spot the difference between good and bad outputs when you see it, not by criticising them for using the tool but by helping them understand what it does well and what it doesn’t.\nMy last major point, is some people will be triggered by any form of AI writing, even if it’s not writing output by an AI. I noticed this especially on reddit, a common retort, even for non-AI based content is something like “low quality AI slop is just a garbage opinion”, but I think that’s just a lazy go-to, as I think one of my earlier posts was about how people will see AI everywhere until they realise people started writing like AI for real, because aside from the hypnotic rhythm of its paragraphs, it generally writes text that is easy to digest, especially if you set a lower reading ease.\nOn progress so far, I’m pretty happy with my general use of it in use cases like “Test the strength of this claim” or “Suggest some ways to express this complex issue in plain English”, but I’d probably avoid in future just saying “Rewrite this in the style of these”, because it rarely just gives you what you actually want.\n\nThere’s more to be said about its use in governance (as I’ve already seen it being pushed on corpos I know), but as a general quality and workflow tool, used only for what it’s good at, it’ll stay in my toolbox for a while.\n\nTagged: #ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #writing, #blogging, #generativeai, #research, #editing, #workflow, #neurodivergent, #audhd, #adhd, #autism, #selfcritique, #word soup, #productivity, #tone, #online writing, #toolbox, #generative ai\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nJournalists making rage, not change\nThis barely researched news story landed on the r/manchester reddit from the guardian yesterday: English councils pay private landlords millions in incentives to house homeless families\n\nimage\nStories like this with no sense of scale always leave me wondering what they _really_ mean, beyond being clickbait, so I looked into it…\n\nFor scope… I’m primarily interested in Manchester (I live here, and they have many more occurences than any other listed region), only in other regions insofar as they compare to Manchester.\n\nI went to the source (Generation Rent) and opened up their data on a computer (since the xlsx-html hide column headers on mobile), switched to the real xlsx and got the headings “Council - Occasions paid an incentive - £ paid in incentives - Highest incentive (£)”. This gives us an average £2958 per ‘occasion paid an incentive’.\n\nWith a max payment of £5980, suggesting a fairly low spread, but can’t find info on exactly who was paid what or when, so 90% of those could have gone to single landlord (unlikely, but possible) over 1138 'occasions’ (best guess, that’s 1138 people or families homed by a landlord who otherwise wouldn’t have let to them because of uncertainty).\n\nFor comparison, the total fund would buy 13-14 'average’ Manchester houses, to bring back into public ownership, or could maybe build 15-20 new houses owned publicly from scratch.\n\nI also put together a 'rough’ estimate of distribution based on reported figures just to inform context.\n\nFor total cost per resident, in Manchester, that’s about £6 each, or ~0.3% of council tax bill funded these incentives. This is slightly less than Enfield (the highest), about the same as Ealing, a little more than Nottingham, and substantially more than Birmingham (£1.45 tho I think that has a larger rural/suburban catchment area where these don’t really apply). London is around £5 per resident.\n\nThe original FOI for Manchester from Generation Rent is here. The wording suggests those occasions paid for 1131 people/families to be homed, but it is unclear about the details, I suspect it would need more FOIs to clarify.\n\n[imo] that seems mostly reasonable to me, but the total spend does support Generation Rent’s case that councils need more tools to use, 0.3% of total council tax paid isn’t nothing, but it’s not a 'tear down the council’ or 'eat all private landlords’ scale problem. Even if a small proportion of the 1000+ people or families are not sleeping on the streets, that’s a pretty good way to spend council money to avoid having to setup a thunderdome :)\n\nAs an unrelated aside, whenever you see “£X MILLIONS” in a headline… if the body of the article doesn’t contain some kind of per-capita or per-subject breakdown, that’s a journalistic failure, usually with the side-effect of creating outrage instead of communicating meaning. The Guardian used to be better than this, cos this type of headline especially belongs in a tabloid, not a real newspaper. Real data makes for real positive outcomes.\n\nWhy does this matter? Surely it’s just a nitpick? What does it matter if the scale isn’t reported? It’s still £3.35m, right?\nIt’s a fairly easy scale to identify, how many people did this money help home? Now we have at least a vague idea.\nIt also helps us identify what other solutions this could afford, and whether they would beat the current outcomes.\nIf you already got 'all the facts’ (or as many as you can), even if the facts don’t support your desired outcomes quite as enthusiastically as you’d prefer, you still have a case that’s harder to tear down or ignore.\nIt prevents readers lazily skipping to conclusions like “ban all private landlords” or “stop the council spending this money”, that make them feel better about complaining, but would harm real home-seekers if the council suddenly had to stop incentivising, but the actual proposal by Generation Rent was not actioned. If you solved the loud problem and not the quiet one, you just made a bigger problem for everybody.\nIt prevents (or at least discourages) 'ragers’ taking up all the oxygen, like on our original reference, the reddit thread. You can find this story in other city subreddits, and I expect on facebook too, with the same kneejerk reactions at various intensities. Placing the problem in context is crucial, or people will take whatever they want from your data, and you will have no way to stop them misrepresenting your objective or the positive outcomes.\nIt’s the right thing to do, even if it makes me look like a dick for nitpicking on bluesky :)\nTagged: #manchester, #council, #guardian, #journalistic malpractice, #ragebait, #clickbait, #journalism, #lazy, #renters, #council tax, #manchester city council\nPosted 3 weeks ago\nAI commercials don’t think you’re dumb, they’re just lying, legally\nAI ads are weird. Every time you see one, it’s an unimaginably low-stakes scenario: “learn some football bants”, “summarise an email”, “identify this fish”, “help me write a cute little note”. Exchanges so meaningless and empty, you wouldn’t even think to ask them.\n\nNobody actually uses gen AI like that, and everyone knows it, including the advertisers and platform decision-makers. People make fun of them as if the agencies are just clueless, like they genuinely believe the killer app for generative AI is party small talk. But that’s not what’s happening…\n\nThey can’t say what you actually use AI for. They can’t suggest “ask it about your mental health” or “do deep research on why my state just made this new draconian law” or “how do I expand my small business?” or even “how do I answer this email without sounding like a dickhead” and “my partner does this annoying thing, how do I deal with it?” (all common and well-recorded use cases, no moral judgment intended), because the moment they do, they open the entire organisation up to legal action. Visit the subreddit for basically any neurodiversity or mental-health issue, and you’ll find post after post of people using ChatGPT to deal with their problems, or just to feel better after a hard day, often with positive results. The corpos selling these genuinely useful services can’t focus on those though, because that comes with far more baggage than the organisation is willing to carry.\n\nHere are some examples: Google’s Gemini Super Bowl run with “Dream Job” and “Party Blitz” (The Verge, Google blog), Microsoft’s Copilot “Your everyday AI companion” Super Bowl ad and its “conversation starters” demos (CBS News, YouTube), Meta’s Ray-Ban Meta glasses Super Bowl campaign with Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt and the cringey “Parent Presentation” spot they pulled almost instantly (Meta, People, TidBITS, The Verge, Business Insider), OpenAI’s “The Intelligence Age” Super Bowl debut (OpenAI, Adweek, The Verge), and Anthropic’s five-second Claude bumper during the 2024 game (Axios).\n\nAI companies like to pretend that their biggest problem is “sometimes our responses contain innaccurate or out of date information”, and hedge/disclaim that right next to the main input textbox, and that’s generally what the press and outrage crowds tend to focus on how the AI can’t generate an accurate diagram of the female reproductive system, for example, but the real potential for harm of AI comes from when it technically can deliver information, but perhaps it shouldn’t, or even if it should, it’s still trusting you, the meatspace-based human, to action or implement based on its information reasonably, and not get mad (or litigious) if it all goes wrong.\n\nAn LLM can tell you to eat rocks, and that’s obviously stupid, but if it tells you to swallow your feelings and get on with your depressing job (even if it hedges a little), or you ask it about something uncomplicated, and its pursuit of balance or of avoiding being contentious/edgy responds with some advice that sounds good but isn’t if you think about it (because it’s trained largely on reddit/quora/etc which are full of terrible advice of their own forms), that’s an output of the system the organisation becomes liable for. So ads just pick the lowest possible stakes and pretend that’s all you’d ever use it for. If you use it for something else, that’s entirely on you.\n\nAI commercials don’t think you’re stupid, their internal data definitely shows them clearly what users are asking for, and if anything I suspect whoever at the marketing agency who puts these things out has said “people know what AI can actually do, they know these things would never happen like this” in a quiet meeting. I’d even bet the lawyers signing off on these ads know exactly what they’re doing, but as long as nobody admits it, there’s an entire system of legal defense that just keeps comfortably rolling along, trying to find new ways of taking your money by providing an always-on ‘e-friend’ who solves all your problems.\n\nTagged: #ai, #ads, #generative ai, #chatgpt, #grok, #gemini, #meta ai, #apple intelligence, #commercials, #marketing, #liability, #lawsuits, #bullshit, #lonliness, #lonely, #mental health\nPosted 4 weeks ago\nEveryone’s Wrong About How AI Works (Including Me)\nSo many people are so confidently wrong about how AI works that it actually makes me more confident the models’ own confidently-wrong output is based on real human input. They’re just reflecting us back at ourselves — smug mistakes in, smug mistakes out.\n\nAnd yeah, I’m in that pool too. I’ll happily waffle on about prompt clarity and outputs under load, and I’m happy to point and laugh at the vagina museum confidently claiming “That’s how LLMs work” in the middle of a thirty or forty tweet thread where every single post is weighed down with their own hallucinations and imaginative explanations with absolutely no connection to reality, because while everyone loves the vagina museum enough for tens of thousands of people to retweet and like their nonsense, literally nobody in their audience has any real idea how the tech works beyond ‘magic box that obviously can’t draw the female reproductive system’, because of course it can’t, that’s not what it’s for.\n\nI like to think (in a lazy crutch kind of way) of LLMs like a bag of scrabble tiles, and especially with images, you tip out the pieces and get mad that it doesn’t spell antidisestablishmentarianism, cos you’re pretty sure you put all the letters in.\n\nSometimes I think the most plausible explanation is that LLMs are just portals into some parallel dimension where an infinite sweatshop of overworked gig-econony ghostwriters are cranking out all our mediocre replies in some frozen time-space continuum. Honestly, if we discovered that tomorrow, nobody would even blink — it’d feel about right cos that’s how we build everything already anyway.\n\nAnd if we’re all going to be confidently wrong, maybe I should just choose to believe the whole thing runs on a single haunted qubit forming an einstein-rosen bridge in a basement somewhere. At least that’s a fun lie, and it’s not much more ridiculous than the reality of gazillions of grains of sand computing probability tables until they hit boundary conditions that collapse into a picture of a lizard lady with three tits or a screed about how AI works.\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #generativeai, #confidentlywrong, #altreality, #shitpost, #techhumour, #dead internet, #vibes, #rant, #skeets, #lol\nPosted 4 weeks ago\nOn the joy of being a bit of a dick to solve problems\nHad a couple of good work days, had a few projects come together into a cohesive set, and discovered I’m a pretty competent script-writer when I take the time to do a proper job — and the icing on the cake… My neighbour just told me she’s finally getting rid of her fucking cockerel. \\o/ [coming up Milhouse dot gif]\n\nAs a bonus: after weeks on a strict diet of mostly potatoes and bean mash, I’ve got snacks again 🤤\n\nAt the start of the year I promised myself I’d stop ignoring the little things that make life worse. Stop listening to the voice that says “just tolerate it, don’t be a dick.” Instead: fix them, nudge, ask, push a bit. Nothing massive, but just trying to solve these things is starting to pay off and my internal “am I being a dick?” counter has barely ticked up.\n\nIf I have any advice for tackling problems that aren’t your fault (those are a bit harder) it’s this: show people the evidence. A simple graph or log can make it obvious who the real dickhead is, and that’s harder to argue with than just venting.\n\nThe next project is pulling together GP practice reviews across a dozen sites run by the same management company, and comparing them to their competitors. Because sometimes the way you get change isn’t by ranting — it’s by drawing a chart that makes everyone else realise just how badly they’re failing, as long as you can present it in a way you’re confident is helpful and informative, and not just ranting.\n\nSometimes fixing life isn’t about grand revolutions. Sometimes it’s about fewer 5 a.m. cock-a-doodle-dos, and finally getting crisps back in your life.

On a good day, with low load, it’s barely distinguishable from magic. It sucks because its incredible power is so easy for people to use against you. All the stuff you’ve left online — the posts, the scraps, the off-hand comments — that’s ammo. And nobody else is going to clean it up. You have to.\n\nIf you’ve got any kind of digital footprint, try it. Open any LLM in a private chat, switch memory/history off, and just ask it about you. That’s the surface-level stuff it already knows. But if you really want to see what it can do, gather your posts like a scammer would, feed them in, and ask it to make assumptions. What do I like? What am I insecure about? What would I fall for? It doesn’t take much.\n\nChatGPT used to try and block this. It would stall or redirect. But since Grok launched, the guardrails have thinned out, and you can do it on either one now. The system message technically says “no personal data about anyone unless it’s public and relevant.” But that’s not an and, it’s an or. Make it public, or argue it’s relevant, and the model plays along. Strip out names, call it fiction, drop in a fake world — it still works. Those rules don’t protect you. They protect the platform’s lawyers.\n\nThis isn’t new either. The same advice applied back in 2011. I built a system for a major media org that scraped and connected data about their users and their families the old-fashioned way. We called it “the Facebook you don’t know you’re part of,” and eventually convinced management to kill it. For scope: the whole point was to sell cars to the wealthiest identifiable member of any household, based on their share history and a handful of behavioural assumptions. Off six or seven data points, it got the hierarchy right about ninety percent of the time. You are leaky.\n\nAnd here’s the thing: our system didn’t even need social media, and it only took a few devs a few months to build. Then one day we added a small feature that suddenly made it so invasive we all just looked at each other and realised we couldn’t ship it. Because the org wasn’t evil, management agreed. It was disturbingly easy to build, and could have been a secret nightmare. I still remember the look on one manager’s face when we explained it — we made it sound difficult and expensive, but he was excited anyway. Most of the rest were horrified. Luckily there were too many layers of management to ship it then, but plenty of others in companies all over the world picked up the baton and sprinted full pelt until they couldn’t sprint any faster… then they needed more, and now we have LLMs.\n\nI haven’t tried (yet), but I reckon with the right phrasing to avoid the weak guardrails (pretend you only want to build it about yourself maybe), you could ask Grok to recreate the whole thing today. And it’d probably do a decent job on the very first try — especially if you had a specific target in mind.\n\nSo yeah. The tech works. It’s almost magic when it isn’t under load. That’s the problem though, if you don’t clean up your trail, the techbros are going to ingest it (if they haven’t already) and it’s going to follow you, because your info is being worked into the models beneath the models (GPT-5 already layering on top of old models, and as above, so below, you’re stuffed in the catacombs). It’s not like google search where you can just file a request to have your database row deleted, there’s no getting it out, what you have online today is what you’ll be known for, forever.\n\nGPT-5 system messages, ish\n\nTagged: #ai, #llms, #grok, #chatgpt, #privacy, #dead internet, #data, #safety, #tech rant, #generative ai, #communication, #genai, #politics, #personal data\nPosted 4 weeks ago with 3 notes\nNobody at YouTube Watches YouTube\nI know this because of something so stupid it borders on parody. The YouTube TV app — which is basically the same web client everywhere now — still doesn’t remember if you want subtitles on. Every single time you open it, or even when it nudges you to re-select your profile after being idle, you have to go dig into menus, find the CC toggle they’ve buried deeper with each redesign, and turn captions back on.\n\nIn 2025, in homes where kids are running around, people are multitasking, and half the viewing is with the volume down, subtitles aren’t an “edge case.” They’re baseline. They’re also not just about convenience — they’re about accessibility. If you’re hard of hearing, you literally can’t use the app properly without turning CC on every time. That’s not a quirk. That’s a broken product.\n\nAnd it’s not like this hasn’t been raised. Hard-of-hearing communities have been complaining to deaf ears (lol) for years. Anyone who watches TV with captions would notice in about thirty seconds. There are at least thirty or forty real people in the YouTube product and design chain who could have caught this, flagged it, or fixed it with probably a single line of code. Instead, it’s been ignored, and in their latest “big refresh” they somehow made it worse.\n\nWhich leads me back to the claim. If even one decision-maker at YouTube — from the lowest PM to the highest-paid boardroom executive — actually relied on captions at home, this wouldn’t still be a problem. The only plausible explanation is that none of them do. That’s the only way something this obvious survives multiple product cycles.\n\nAnd that’s what really gets me. As a designer, it’s not just annoying — it’s insulting. It’s a reminder that the platform with a monopoly on so much creative culture is run by people who don’t use it the way most of us do. The people making the calls aren’t living with the same pain points, so those problems never get solved. They’re invisible at the top, glaring everywhere else.\n\nAnd sure — in the grand scheme of YouTube’s endless list of backwards decisions and neglected features, this is a small one. But it’s also telling. If they can’t be bothered to fix the basics, what chance is there they’ll tackle the bigger failures?\n\nSomeone really does need to disrupt YouTube.\n\nTagged: #youtube, #design, #accessibility, #enshittification, #subtitles, #rant, #deafawareness, #deafculture, #hard of hearing\nPosted 1 month ago\nCrypto Seems Stupid, But It Solves a Problem (Just Probably Not for You, Yet)\nCrypto as an industry is stupid. Let’s get that out of the way. It’s a clown car of scams, cult vibes, and half-baked libertarian fantasies about freedom without responsibility. It is, in the broadest sense, ridiculous.\n\nBut here’s the awkward bit: it actually does solve a problem. Just not your problem. At least, not yet.\n\nThe Problem Nobody Wants to Admit\nThe money layer of the internet isn’t neutral. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal — these aren’t just pipes you can pour payments through. They’re gatekeepers, and they know it. They’ve cut off porn platforms. They’ve throttled sex educators. They’ve quietly shut down queer creators, kink communities, even writers who looked too adjacent to the “wrong” politics.\n\nAnd now it’s games too — recent reporting shows Steam and Itch have both been pressured by payment processors (last I read, they denied it). Even entirely normal hustles and small creators get hit, sometimes just for TOS violations or false flags. People lose their income overnight, with no recourse, because some fringe product or anonymous report tripped a system designed to protect the most powerful customers, not the real people using it.\n\nWhy Crypto Looks Like the Wrong Answer\nCrypto has earned its reputation. Scams, pump-and-dumps, rug-pulls, and plenty of users who talk like failed cult leaders. It’s been lumped in with the dark web since the start. While it does enable shady stuff, it doesn’t have to enable only that.\n\nAnd despite the myths, most crypto isn’t really anonymous; they’re pseudonymous. Every transaction is public, forever. If investigators already have a thread, they can pull it.\n\nThen there’s the energy debate. Proof-of-work mining is wasteful, sure — but newer tokens don’t drink the ocean. Even with the worst offenders, the problem often comes down to bad infrastructure and perverse incentives. Companies like Nvidia have no reason to reinvent chips when the old ones sell fine. The system rewards inefficiency because that’s what pays.\n\n…But It Does Fix This One\nHere’s the rub: if you’re a sex worker suddenly cut off from payment processors, or a queer creator flagged as “brand unsafe,” or someone whose platform got kneecapped because Stripe panicked about “reputational risk,” crypto might be your only option left standing.\n\nStablecoins in particular are boring, which is exactly what you want from money. They let people send and receive without begging permission from a boardroom of executives who’ve never heard of you and wouldn’t admit they canceled you even if you asked. Yes, the current US administration is fumbling regulation in a way that makes stablecoins look like just another scam coin. But some form of responsible regulation would be welcome — and overdue.\n\nAnd you don’t have to use Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or whatever fresh coin the nerds are yelling about this week (hint, it’s 99.9% probably a scamcoin if it’s come out in the last few years). As long as everyone involved agrees it’s pretty stable, or you’re in and out quickly (or comfortable holding volatility in your pocket), any token will do. The nerds deserve mockery for their blind optimism, but they’re not entirely wrong that used responsibly, it has value.\n\nThe “Yet”\nMaybe that’s not your problem. Maybe you’ve got a regular job, a respectable bank account, and no reason to worry about whether your income stream will vanish overnight because some corpo compliance reviewer didn’t like the shape of your business.\n\nBut the choke point isn’t theoretical. It’s already here. Entire groups are being financially deplatformed right now. Maybe you don’t need crypto — until suddenly you do.\n\nPay Attention\nNobody’s asking you to jump in with both feet. But understand what it actually is because maybe one day you’ll need it — or maybe a creator you like will get cut off, and you’ll want a way to slip them some support.\n\nThis matters more as platforms corporate-ize. YouTube, Twitch, Patreon — all of them focus on fewer, bigger players once the VC money takes the reins. It happened in microstock: the floor kept rising until most contributors were shoved into the basement to fight over scraps.\n\nCrypto isn’t utopia. It won’t buy you coffee at Starbucks anytime soon (or at least not outside of the valley). But for all its absurdity, it’s one of the very few escape hatches left in a financial system that wants everything channeled between two high walls, sterile and market-ready, like pigs driven to slaughter.\n\nYou don’t have to like it. You don’t even have to use it. But it already exists, and it already works. It costs you basically nothing to understand the option — and you might be glad you did.\n\nTagged: #crypto, #cryptocurrency, #bitcoin, #ethereum, #stablecoins, #fintech, #financial censorship, #deplatformed, #payment processors, #mutual aid, #swers, #sexwork, #queer creators, #adult content, #censorship, #platform politics, #compliance capitalism, #tech rant\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhy you should use AI for art\nGen AI’s uptake has been wild, even though it’s far from a perfect tool. It’s already fucked over a million or more commercial artists worldwide by swamping every once-viable digital content market with slop. And it’s not just because the tools are bad—most “hustlers” trying to make hay while the sun shines (think markets like KDP, POD, or microstock, though the last one’s less “swamped” and more out-competed by free crappy images of whatever you can imagine) haven’t really reacted to the influx yet.\n\nMy main issue isn’t with AI adoption overall. I think it’s been over-adopted long before it’s actually good, but it is already occasionally useful when deployed in the right places and the right ways—as a tool that multiplies force, not as a worker replacement.\n\nThe problem’s with the irresponsible adoption: platforms that can’t tell the difference between slop and real value, and the absence of systems to determine that, because they’re too busy trying to leverage gen AI themselves, and not busy enough preventing exploitation by it. Eventually, those platforms will have to catch up or die.\n\nThere’s an argument about gen AI where it doesn’t belong, like spewing bullshit onto social media. But the biggest problem isn’t that they “stole” literally every image they could find to build the systems in the first place—regulators are now letting them get away with it, because it technically doesn’t violate copyright.\n\nCopyright’s on the exact words you used, not the style of words you tend toward; on the exact brush strokes, not your general use of phthalo blue (or however you spell it) and a palette knife. Likewise, intellectual property is the names and places in your world, not that you tend to set scenes in space with a big-titted lizard lady and a talking cat. People got mad at something nobody saw coming, so it’s not surprising there weren’t really any tools to stop it.\n\nAnyway, onto my story.\nThe short version: once upon a time, I was a microstock photographer and illustrator (a mediocre one, that’s fine, not everybody has to be Picasso). Eventually, loosely a video-illustrator of sorts (shaders to video). Going into around 2016 with somewhere near 10,000 pieces of content in my portfolio—not exactly earning a strong living, but earning enough to have been worth the time to make them. Well, microstock fell off a cliff (at least for me and everyone except the top 3% of producers) as the market consolidated (I won’t get into microstock history, but it was once a thriving industry). The better producers out-competed me (fairly), the agencies hoovered up or destroyed each other, and Unsplash and co came along and took the edge cases and convenience users, dropping my income to 20% of the peak. Even after adding 15,000 videos or so to my portfolio, that started okay, then dipped too as the agencies who ingested it struggled to keep them relevant or I got outcompeted in their algorithms.\n\nSo I shifted into print on demand. I lost track of how many designs in my portfolios years ago, but I’m pretty sure it’s at least half a million overall, maybe more—I honestly have no idea. My designs are basic, but I made them all myself, with the aid of scripts and tools I built, and put in the legwork to tag them and upload them. They paid a little… until gen AI came along (what, like 2021?) and bam, all of a sudden print on demand wasn’t viable cos every store—Cafepress, Teepublic, Redbubble, Spreadshirt, Zazzle, and I’m sure half a dozen I’ve forgotten—all got swamped by pretty poor quality, but technically passable free upsized Stable Diffusion characters with too many fingers and not enough characters in the text. But customers aren’t that bothered if all they want is a mug that says “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my morning cock” for less than twenty bucks. So POD dropped to 10% of its peak too (maybe less by now, I don’t bother to check anymore)…\n\nI actively encourage artists, especially those who once earned a real living, to use whatever AI tools they want or need to—to make up for their loss in sales, to leverage for more work, for happier clients, for faster throughput. Because commercial art isn’t always about being the best; it’s often just about getting enough work done in each new day to keep the lights on and the Photoshop subscription paid (I’ll cover this another day).\n\nWhen these whining kids on social media get triggered by a lazy article that has a “not just x, but y” conceit or an image of Sonic with too many fingers (does Sonic even have fingers?), because they feel like it stole their furry fan art from those 2 images they were proud of posting on Tumblr 10 years ago, I don’t give a fuck…\n\nThe entire market for commercial art got wiped out time and time again, and people have been stealing my images on the internet this entire millennium, and I never complained about it because that’s what the internet is. It’s stealing the Sonic IP so you can have him kissing a real girl in your lazy fanfic if you want to. And getting triggered at regular people just discovering the joy of creation for the first time—because they weren’t raised with enough time or energy to get into making their own work when they were entitled kids…\n\nI say let them make whatever trash they want with AI, let Disney cram it into every corner they want to, and I’ll gladly look at and maybe even enjoy it, because art isn’t just the execution, art is the idea\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #aiuptake, #commercialart, #microstock, #pod, #kdp, #artists, #slop, #hustlers, #platforms, #copyright, #generative ai, #disney, #ai, #business, #commercial, #stock photography\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhy is everyone so mad about asylum hotels?\nI didn’t understand this issue very well, so I did a deep dive, and here’s what I learned…\n\nIf you’ve read the headlines lately, you’d think local councils are writing cheques to Premier Inn and Travelodge for thousands of asylum seekers. That’s not actually true — but the reality is messier, and that’s why everyone’s shouting past each other.\n\nWho really pays for hotels?\nThe hotel contracts are signed and paid for by the Home Office — not your local council. The National Audit Office (NAO) sets this out clearly in its work on the Home Office’s asylum accommodation contracts (NAO briefing, May 2025). In 2023/24, the Home Office expected to spend £4.7bn on asylum support, including £3.1bn on hotels (NAO report, Mar 2024). In 2024/25, hotel spending ran at about £108m per month — roughly £1.3bn for the year (Reuters fact check, Jun 2025; see also NAO, May 2025).\n\nSo why are councils angry?\nBecause while they don’t pay the hotel bill, they do pay for everything that comes with it:\n\nSchools and childcare, safeguarding and social care.\nHousing and homelessness support when people leave hotels — whether granted status or evicted.\nLocal services like waste collection, environmental health and community safety.\nThe Local Government Association says councils receive no funding for hotels and want the same per‑bed support that exists for other accommodation types (LGA briefing, May 2024). Case in point: Hillingdon reports a £5m annual pressure linked to supporting people leaving hotels, with a cumulative shortfall over £16m (Hillingdon Council, Jul 2025). Glasgow forecast £26.5m of asylum‑related costs in 2024/25 (Glasgow City HSCP paper, Jan 2025).\n\nThis all lands after a decade of squeezed local budgets. Independent analysis shows core local government spending remains below 2010/11 in real terms (Institute for Government, Jul 2024; see also NAO, Feb 2025).\n\nWhy did the central bill drop?\nNot because the Home Office suddenly got efficient. The drop is mainly from using fewer hotels, packing more people into remaining sites, and shifting to cheaper options like large sites or other accommodation models. The NAO documents hotel closures and plans to reduce reliance on them (NAO report, Mar 2024). The Migration Observatory estimates hotel accommodation averaged about £170 per person per night in 2024/25 — far more than other options (Migration Observatory, Aug 2025). The House of Commons Library explains the policy shift to barges and large sites to cut hotel use (Commons Library, Jul 2023).\n\nWhy are councils going to court now?\nRecent legal challenges (like the Epping case) argue hotels can’t be repurposed this way without planning permission. That’s about where hotels are used, not ending hotel use everywhere. After the High Court ruling, the government said it would appeal and manage closures “in an orderly way” (Reuters, Aug 2025; also Guardian, Aug 2025).\n\nDo councils get any central funding at all?\nYes, but it’s fragmented and often doesn’t match actual local costs. Examples include the Asylum Dispersal Grant and Move On Grant funding instructions to local authorities (GOV.UK Dispersal Grant 2025–26; GOV.UK Move On Grant, Mar 2025). The LGA continues to push for proper funding tied to the pressures councils face (LGA campaign explainer).\n\nWhy “Stop the Boats” is such a stupid slogan\n“Stop the Boats” sounds simple, but it’s an undeliverable demand. Britain has no jurisdiction over where the boats set off from, no control over the wars, persecution, or other disasters that push people onto them, and no runway left in the countries of origin after decades of bombing, interventions, and half‑baked foreign policy. You can’t stop people fleeing danger with a soundbite.\n\nThat’s why it works politically: it’s a perfect wedge issue. It promises a solution that can’t be delivered, so whichever government fails can be painted as weak, and whichever opportunist shouts loudest can look like a saviour. Even if they took power, they’d be in the same situation — the only policies left would be cruel, extreme, and harmful to everyone involved.\n\nA better approach would be the opposite: quicker and fairer asylum decisions, investment in schools, health centres and libraries to support both new arrivals and existing residents, and proper public spending that strengthens communities. Building capacity is a force multiplier. It helps everyone.\n\nSo who’s really footing the bill?\nAll of us. The Home Office still spends billions centrally on hotels and asylum support (see NAO above). Councils then pay for the knock‑on local costs — with some grants, but large gaps remaining. That means council tax rises and service cuts are still on the table in many areas (IFS, Jun 2024; Commons Library, Jul 2025). The numbers move around, but the bill never disappears.\n\nImmigration isn’t the root of all our problems though, it’s barely even visible in the budget.\n\nimage\nPeople are angry… Some are angry for stupid racist reasons, some because they just don’t want to hear foreign on the bus or are terrified of muslims after decades of demonisation, some because their councils are broke and the general sense of social rot is spreading, and some because the whole thing feels like a giant shell game where the poorest communities always end up carrying the weight.\n\nThe overall cost just isn’t that much compared to the many many other problems that its convenient for the halls of power to pretend aren’t there, because most people have never seen what the budget really looks like, so of course they’re going to be easier to deal with if they’re not complaining about real problems, but instead complaining about problems you could fix for the cost of a couple of hospitality villages if you really wanted it to go away.\n\nThis Labour government seems unable to raise taxes in the places that would raise funds, won’t means-test the largest expenditures (like the pension, even though it could save £25 billion for a cost of less than half a billion), won’t pursue tech companies or multinationals who export wealth, won’t push any policies that might stunt ‘growth’ (despite there being little to no evidence for it), and have no power to establish new exports as more money leaves local economies than flow into them, but let’s not make this about Brexit ;)\n\nThe short version is, immigrants of any kind are not a big line item in anyone’s budget, the costs are tiny in reality, but they’re an easy target, vulnerable, visible, and all the answers are way more complicated than they seem if all you hear/read are soundbites from Farage and his fellow opportunists, or headlines from any news source that has an interest in pretending it’s simple so they can offer the most appealing answers.\n\nTagged: #asylum, #immigration, #refugees, #stoptheboats, #ukpolitics, #councils, #austerity, #racism, #publicservices, #housingcrisis, #shellgame, #wedgepolitics, #community, #stop the boats, #britain\nPosted 1 month ago\nCancel Culture has never cancelled anyone*\nCancel culture doesn’t exist. Not in the way people swear blind it does. You don’t get erased. You don’t vanish. You get a headline, a timeout, then a new gig.\n\nMel Gibson snarled his way back to Oscar nods, Johnny Depp waltzed into Cannes, James Franco slipped into European indies, Louis C.K. bagged a Grammy, Aziz Ansari shrugged it off with a Netflix drop, Shane Gillis went from SNL fired to SNL host, Gina Carano swapped Disney for Christian schlock, Kevin Hart kept the stadiums, Nick Cannon strolled back into Viacom, Roseanne Barr toured, Kanye West sold out again, Morgan Wallen topped charts, Marilyn Manson booked a tour, Shia LaBeouf turned up in Coppola’s Megalopolis, Dave Chappelle never even sat down long enough to notice. Cancelled? No. Just briefly inconvenienced.\n\nThe only real rule: if you’re in prison, you’re off the board. Weinstein, R. Kelly, Danny Masterson — yeah, you’re not back, yet.\n\n*And then the tiny minority that make up our asterisk. The ones who aren’t inside but still didn’t claw back a platform. Bill Cosby, free but radioactive. Michael Richards, one racist meltdown and done, for now. Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, out of the anchor chair with nowhere else to go.\n\nAnd then there’s Martha Stewart, the exception to the exception. She did the time, five months for insider trading, came out and played it like a badge of honour — prison as a rebrand. Her career was already fading, the jail stint shot it full of life, and she’s been riding that wave ever since, cooking shows and memes and a Snoop Dogg side-hustle that made her cooler than she ever was before.\n\nEveryone else? Cancellation is just another visibility bump. A career pivot. A rebrand. The “left” pretend it’s justice, the “right” scream it’s exile — but look around. The bellends in question faced no real consequence beyond a sabbatical followed by another paycheck. To actually stay cancelled you’ve got to be properly heinous, AND an utter prick to work with. Otherwise? You’re not cancelled.

The things that make life worse for people here every single day. Instead the noise is all about “stop the boats.”, despite immigration costs being barely 2%-3% (much less, like way below 1% if you only consider ‘illegals’ or 'irregular migration’ if you prefer corpo-speak) of the budget.\n\nThe flag-shaggers terrorising immigrants in this city aren’t helping — they’re making everything worse. We can’t do anything about the boats, we don’t control where they come from. And yeah, asylum needs fixing — but it should be funded centrally, not dumped on local councils that can’t even fix a pothole after years of Tory cuts. And it sure as hell shouldn’t be public money lining hotel chains’ pockets to lock vulnerable people up like prisoners.\n\nThe whole thing is just a wedge issue. A distraction. Designed to keep people snapping at each other while the real enemies — the corporate interests and wealth hoarders — strip this city bare and laugh at us for falling for it.\n\nLabour came in promising to help people, and just ran riot over the country with more Tory-lite policy, keeping their gerry-mandering and mandatory photo ID discouraging poorer voters from having any say in change. It’s not surprising Reform are gaining ground because we’re ALL sick of it, wherever you land on the political spectrum.\n\nInstead of screaming at each other over boats we can’t control, we should be screaming at the people who do control things here: the ones running this city into the ground. Demand better housing, proper funding for people who need it most, working public services, safe roads, real mental health care. That’s not left or right, and certainly not a 'culture’ problem.\n\nTagged: #manchester, #homelessness, #poverty, #nhs collapse, #infrastructure, #gentrification, #class war, #refugees welcome\nPosted 1 month ago\nGenerative AI and the Illusion of Work\nGenerative AI isn’t just a tool, it’s a form of intellectual retail therapy — the sense of progress without the pain of actual delivery.\n\nFor those of us with projectitis — always starting, rarely finishing — the fit is perfect. Fire off a prompt, get back an outline, a roadmap, a code scaffold. It feels like momentum. It looks like work. But it’s no different to shuffling your to-do list: activity disguised as progress.\n\nThe machine is tuned for this. Every output arrives padded with positive reinforcement. “Here’s your great idea, made real.” That little surge of satisfaction is the same feedback loop that keeps social media addictive. You don’t need to publish, launch, or finish anything. You just need to ask, and you’re rewarded with the feeling of accomplishment.\n\nGPT-5 stripped out much of the fawning affirmation, and suddenly people who’d been using it as an emotional support device felt the loss, not just of its warmth, but of its comforting reassurance that you’re great.\n\nGenerative AI is excellent at massaging your brain into believing you’re productive. But believing isn’t the same as doing. It’s a mirror that flatters, not a partner that delivers.\n\nTagged: #generativeai, #chatgpt, #productivity, #procrastination, #projectitis, #illusionofwork, #llms, #artificialintelligence, #dopamine, #techculture\nPosted 1 month ago\nBuying Games for the Shelf\nWe’re living in a FOMO bubble. Not the dot-com (lol), not the housing market (tho we are) — but lower-stakes digital backlog bubble. People are buying games they never play, stacking them hundreds deep in their libraries, just to have them available.\n\nThe numbers make it clear:\n\nOn PC, surveys show 24% of owned games are never played at all. Steam’s own data has clocked it higher, with ~37% of registered games never even launched.\nEven when people do launch a game, they often don’t stick. Achievement unlock rates show the drop-off. On Xbox, only 52% of players beat the first boss in Hellblade II; in Starfield, 25% never even reached space. In Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, 43% never left the tutorial country. Steam and PlayStation tend to fare better — but the pattern holds.\nIt’s not literally “90% don’t clear the first hurdle,” but the drop-off is still brutal. Between a quarter who never play at all and another 40–60% who stall before the first proper chapter, you’re looking at the overwhelming majority never making it past the opening act. And that’s staggering when you think about how much money changes hands just to dabble.\n\nNow zoom out. The global games market in 2024 hit $182.7 billion. Mobile is about half of that ($92B), console another quarter ($51B), and PC the rest (~$43B). Of that, somewhere between 40% and 55% — $70 to $100 billion — comes directly from time-limited monetisation. Battle passes, seasonal events, gacha banners, rotating cosmetic shops. FOMO by design.\n\nThat’s the real engine: not just buying to play, but buying so you don’t miss out. Buying because the skin is only here this week, because the pass expires in 30 days, because if you don’t grab it now, it’s gone.\n\nPut it together and you’ve got a market propped up by two linked illusions:\n\nIllusion of intent: people think they’ll play the games they buy. Half don’t.\nIllusion of scarcity: people think they’ll miss out if they don’t buy now. Often they won’t.\nIf you’re the kind of player who buys FIFA every year, or drops sixty or seventy bucks on the latest Call of Duty or Assassin’s Creed and spends the next twelve months slowly working through it, you’re probably getting your money’s worth. The economics make sense. But the moment you’ve got a backlog — even a modest one — the numbers go sideways. You’re almost certainly spending at least double what you should, and for plenty of people with hundreds of unplayed games in their libraries, it’s many times more than that.\n\nGames are fun, sure. People still sink hundreds of hours into the big ones. But the industry is running on backlog economics and FOMO fuel. It’s a strange kind of bubble: the value isn’t in what you play, but in what you buy and never touch.\n\nMaybe it bursts one day, maybe it doesn’t. What’s certain is that subscription platforms like Game Pass add another layer of pressure: developers now have to build for discovery churn as much as for play. That’s fine if you’re Ubisoft and can pump out an Assassin’s Creed every other year with DLC on top, but for smaller studios the bubble is harsher. They can pivot fast, sure, but one flop in a backlog-driven, subscription-shaped market can still wipe them out.\n\nTagged: #gaming, #videogames, #backlog, #steam, #xbox, #playstation, #gamepass, #fomo, #dlc, #subscription\nPosted 1 month ago with 1 note\nDiplomatic Incompetence\nAt my recent GP’s patient participation meeting (trying to get them to fix their many problems), several patients used the word incompetent about reception staff. Not careless, not under-trained — “incompetent”. The practice manager’s summary on wrap-up: “We’re facing training challenges.”\n\nI pushed back: “I think we said incompetent.” She replied: “I was being diplomatic.” Then we moved on…\n\nThat was probably sensible in the room (no need for the distraction over semantics). But here’s the thing: if you downgrade incompetence to a “training challenge,” you all but guarantee nothing will change. Training challenges are easy — PDF modules, refresher courses, maybe a workshop. Incompetence isn’t. Incompetence means people who are disengaged, burnt out, or actively hostile to the patients they’re supposed to help. You can’t train that away. You have to either change the system and the staff, or replace them. And that requires naming the problem honestly.\n\nThis isn’t just a healthcare thing. It’s the entire operating mode of UK Labour under Starmer. Every crisis is framed as a “challenge.” Structural wealth extraction? A productivity challenge. Exploitation baked into gig work? A regulation challenge. House-building collapse? A planning challenge.\n\nEverything becomes small, manageable, “reasonable” — because the people at the top are too busy being diplomatic to those with power to risk saying what’s true: these aren’t challenges, they’re rot. And rot doesn’t shift because you call it something nicer.\n\nYou can train through a challenge.

They’ll pull out the lowest-value, dumbest possible inclusion from a mostly sensible report, slap a rage-bait headline on it, and rake in the clicks.\n\nThe press are too busy trying to get the eyes-on their website, they let the serious, boring failures slide. Making a molehill of the mountains, and mountains of the molehills, while the water keeps draining either way, AI or no AI.\n\nTagged: #ai, #water, #infrastructure, #politics, #clickbait, #climate, #mismanagement\nPosted 1 month ago with 1 note\nAttention Triage\nThere’s too much. Too much news, too much noise, too much “urgent” stuff that — if you squint — turns out to be neither urgent nor stuff.\n\nIt’s not that none of it matters. It’s that your attention is finite, and the world will gladly burn it on things you can’t change, can’t fix, or don’t actually care about once you stop doomscrolling.\n\n1. Is this a thing I can change?\nIf no — park it. Read about it if it’s interesting, but don’t burn emotional fuel on it. Awareness does not equal responsibility.\n\n2. Is this a thing that actually affects me or people I care about?\nIf it’s happening in a domain where I have zero stake and zero influence, it’s probably not my fire to fight.\n\n3. Is the problem new, or just today’s flavour of an old one?\nIf it’s the same rot as last week but with a fresh headline, maybe I don’t need to rehearse my outrage again.\n\n4. Is there a source of truth I trust on this?\nIf all I’ve got is vibes, memes, and people yelling into feeds, maybe I don’t have enough to form a useful opinion yet.\n\n5. Will talking about it do anything?\nIf my words aren’t going to change the outcome — not even my own mindset — then maybe this is just venting. And that’s fine, but let’s call it what it is and be comfortable with that.\n\n6. Am I reacting to the thing, or to the way it’s being presented?\nA lot of what passes for “news” is just someone picking a camera angle for maximum twitch. Make sure the story, not the packaging, is what’s got my attention.\n\nYou can’t solve everything, you can’t even meaningfully track everything — but you can keep your focus for the things that are actually in your reach.\n\nThink of it like the Serenity Prayer, but without the theological framing:\nGrant me the clarity to see which fires are mine to fight, the focus to put my energy there, and the sense to ignore the rest before it eats my week. I’m already a sucker for a rabbit-hole, I could do with sticking my nose into fewer of them.\n\nTagged: #mental triage, #attention economy, #coping strategies, #doomscrolling, #critical thinking, #focus\nPosted 1 month ago\nZeno’s Pint Glass and the AI That Never Arrives\nThere’s an old Greek thought experiment about never quite getting where you’re going. Zeno imagined you could never actually arrive anywhere if you kept halving the distance: you walk halfway to the door, then half the remainder, then half that again… and in the perfect little vacuum of ancient philosophy, you spend forever inching forward without ever stepping over the threshold.\n\nIn the pub version, you’ve got a pint glass. You keep pouring in half of what’s left from another pint. Each pour gets smaller, cleaner, more precise — but the bastard glass never actually fills. It asymptotically approaches “full” without ever tipping over into frothy satisfaction.\n\nThat’s AI right now. Every upgrade, every model release, every breathless press cycle brings a smaller, cleverer pour. It’s nearly human, almost right, practically perfect — except for the missing teaspoon of sense, context, or detail that would actually make it whole. And because the gap keeps shrinking, the failure gets harder to point to without sounding petty.\n\nBut the gap never goes away. You can drink from it, sure, but you’ll always taste the absence. And that absence — tiny but terminal — is enough to keep it in the realm of “impressive tool” rather than “actual replacement.”\n\nIt’s a pint of promise, forever just shy of the rim. Can we make do, or do we need to wait for yet another never for the leap to come?\n\nTagged: #zenosparadox, #pints, #pubmaths, #generativeai, #llms, #asymptotic, #techrant, #philosophy, #computersarestupid, #ai, #almostbutnotquite, #publogic, #maths, #gap, #pubchat, #rant, #Ask ChatGPT\nPosted 1 month ago\nProfiling the Job Out of Existence? Not quite, but hmm\nAI’s earliest provable gains have mostly landed in the same places where “interaction profiling” could turn a human role into a near-fully automated pipeline. In other words, the jobs seeing the most benefit today may also be the first to face replacement tomorrow — not because AI is perfect, but because the work was already structured in a way that made it easy to replicate.\n\nIn practice, this works best where the inputs and outputs are consistent and the “human in the middle” mostly follows a known pattern. Roles like insurance claims handling, tier-1 customer service, compliance auditing, or simple bug triage all fit the bill. These are jobs that already run on a playbook, and AI tools are now proving they can run that playbook faster and cheaper.\n\nIf a company can log every query, prompt, edit, and output from an AI-assisted worker, it can build a profile of how that person does the job. With enough history, that profile stops being just analytics and starts becoming a template. Feed that into a fine-tuned model, wrap it in some orchestration to run on a schedule or trigger from events, and you have a “synthetic worker” that covers 90–95% of the original role.\n\nFrom there, it’s just gap-filling: a smaller human team handles exceptions, phone calls, and anything too complex or sensitive for the bot. One person supervising the edge-cases of ten digital clones is an attractive equation for management — especially in cost-sensitive industries where output is easy to measure and errors are cheap to fix.\n\nThat doesn’t make mass replacement inevitable. Many (responsible) companies would rather keep the headcount and use the efficiency gains to increase profits, throughput or service levels. But in roles that already fit the automation mould, the path from “AI-assisted” to “AI-replaced” is pretty short. It’s not quite the man who feeds the dog to stop him touching the machine, but it’s on approach.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #coding, #chatgpt, #communication\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhere Are the Big AI Wins?\nI’ve been wondering why we aren’t hearing more good news about AI adoption by now. With two or three years of mass LLM use, you’d expect plenty of “this tool changed our business” stories from companies that jumped in early—not just hype, not just speculative “future of work” thinkpieces.\n\nThere are some genuine wins.\n\nCoding assistants like GitHub Copilot have solid evidence behind them. In controlled trials, developers finished tasks over 50% faster, with companies reporting 10–25% more code shipped to production. Gains are biggest for less experienced devs, but seniors get a speed boost too.\nWriting and content tasks benefit as well. Experiments show professionals completing work 40% faster and with higher quality ratings when assisted by ChatGPT.\nCustomer support has clear wins: one Fortune 500 call centre saw a 14% productivity lift, 34% for new hires, and fewer escalations after adding AI agent-assist tools.\nIn finance and insurance, some firms are using GPT-based tools to slash claims processing from an hour to ten minutes, or to cut audit costs by 90%+.\nThat’s the provable stuff—measurable, replicable, and tied directly to the AI being in place.\n\nThen there’s the other end of the spectrum:\n\nAgent mode—letting AI run complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human oversight—mostly outputs wrong or off-target work. Looks busy, delivers headaches.\nCreative “revolution” hasn’t happened. No AI-only bestsellers, blockbuster films, or award-winning ad campaigns. Plenty of experiments and gimmicks, little consistent commercial payoff.\nLots of companies claim “transformative” AI results but offer no data. Often these are vendor case studies that read more like marketing copy than independent proof.\nIn between are the early signals:\n\nBuzzFeed saw a 60% traffic boost from AI-generated quizzes, though long-term monetisation is unclear.\nAgencies and writers are using AI to brainstorm and draft faster, but outcomes still depend on heavy human shaping.\nMany organisations say they’re saving time in knowledge work, but without hard numbers or clear bottom-line impact—yet.\nOverall, the case for moderate optimism is there. The tech already works in certain contexts, and even agent mode is barely a year old. But if AI was truly delivering across the board, we’d be drowning in positive case studies. Most companies don’t actually want “half the staff, same profits”—they’d prefer “same staff, double profits.” That means the biggest adoption pressure will come in fields where people can prove AI delivers practical, repeatable gains.\n\nRight now, those fields exist, but they’re thinner on the ground than the hype suggests.\n\nTagged: #genai, #llms, #generative ai, #success\nPosted 1 month ago\nWhy Conservatives Hate Porn, Really\nConservative censorship of sexual content doesn’t prevent abuse—it enables it. Porn isn’t a substitute for sex education, but in many environments it’s the only thing available. And when you deliberately deny people access to information about sex, consent, and bodily autonomy, you don’t create purity—you create victims.\n\nThat’s not an accident. It’s a strategy.\n\nEasily accessible pornography—despite being non-educational—is often the only exposure many people have to sex, bodies, and consent.\n\nThis exposure, flawed as it is, still provides more sexual literacy than the willful vacuum created by conservative censorship.\n\nPorn as Default Sex Ed\nIn the absence of real sex education, porn becomes the primary (sometimes only) source of information about sex for young people.\nWhile distorted, it still communicates basic ideas: what genitals look like, that sex exists, that desire exists, that women can enjoy sex.\nThat baseline awareness is more than the total ignorance enforced by abstinence-only frameworks.\nSexual Ignorance is a Tool of Control\nConservative moral panic about pornography and sexual content is not about protecting anyone—it’s about maintaining ignorance and shame.\nAn uninformed population—especially women—is easier to coerce, silence, and abuse.\nWhen people don’t understand their own bodies, rights, or consent, they’re more vulnerable.\nCensorship Increases Harm\nEfforts to ban porn, restrict sex ed, and criminalize expression (e.g., book bans, internet filters) do not reduce harm—they increase it.\nRestricting sex education correlates with higher teen pregnancy, STD transmission, and sexual violence.\nThe conservative agenda is not merely prudish—it’s strategically regressive, with measurable real-world harm.\nIntentionality\nAt a certain point, the consistent, data-ignoring push for censorship becomes indistinguishable from intent.\nIf harm is predictable and sustained, and policies never change, then harm is either the goal or an accepted price for maintaining power.\nEvery time we see these ‘conservative groups’ winning in the name of purity, remember their goal is ignorance, they stand for precisely what they claim to stand against.\n\nTagged: #porn, #adult, #conservatives, #christian, #sa\nPosted 1 month ago\nYouGov Finds 45% of Brits Are Idiots\nTurns out nearly half the UK supports the idea of mass migrant removals. Not just “stop the boats” nonsense — actual, large-scale deportations of people already here. That number jumps to 86% for Reform UK voters, but includes about a quarter of Labour and Lib Dem voters too. Grim.\n\nBut here’s the kicker: it’s based on pure fiction.\n\nMost people backing mass deportations think the majority of migrants are here illegally. They’re wrong. The illegal population is somewhere between 120k and 1.3 million. The legal migrant population? Over 10 million. So what the 45% are really saying is, “We want loads of people gone — but we don’t know who, or why, and we’re not going to check.”\n\nWhen asked about specific migrant groups (e.g. doctors, legal asylum seekers, skilled workers), that same crowd suddenly backpedals. Support drops like a rock. The only consistent “yes, deport them” groups are the tabloid bogeymen: benefits claimants, small boat arrivals, unskilled workers without visas.\n\nSo the public thinks it supports mass deportation, but only because it’s got the wrong end of the stick jammed directly up its own newsfeed. YouGov ran trade-off scenarios — what if deporting people hurts the NHS? Or the economy? Or reduces tax revenue? The answers showed public opinion is built on vibes, not outcomes. The minute consequences are introduced, the conviction dissolves.\n\n📎 YouGov: Is there public support for large-scale removals of migrants?\n\nKeep reading\n\nTagged: #yougov, #immigration, #policy, #ignorance, #britain, #politics\nPosted 1 month ago with 1 note\nParasites, Profits and Corporate Cowardice\nAn Internet where expression exists — but only within permitted enclosures. Where art, speech, community, and identity still technically happen, but always under the watchful eye of monetization risk. Where platforms encourage you to be “authentic” while quietly penalizing anything too real, too raw, or too noncommercial.\n\nWhere racists and scammers, bots and trolls can fly by night under fake photo scans and temporary appearance of compliance, while sowing rot from the inside out, but the business model already shifted to helping the rot grow because that’s where the sun is shining in the quarterly reports..\n\nTentacular… It’s not dead. It’s not hollow. It’s Blighted, rotting under the weight of the parasite that’s infested its network of wire with its own tendrils dripping bias and hate, ignorant over-reaction or poorly-fitting incompatible dream.\n\nHeld hostage by ad revenue, payment processors, investor pressure, and legal panic. Every platform wants to be the space where culture happens — but none want to take responsibility for what that culture says, or who it threatens, how it refuses to behave or what fluid masses of hate it will enable.\n\nSo they extract. They monetize. They whisper about “creator empowerment” while building systems that nerf reach, demonetize nuance, and algorithmically quarantine risk. Not because they hate users — but because they fear becoming liable for them.\n\nThis is cowardice at scale. More than just censorship from governments. More than mobs with pitchforks. Self-inflicted restrictions from billion-dollar companies scared of looking like publishers, scared of lawsuits, scared of regulators — and more than anything, scared of the advertisers who believe their false promises of impressions, when 90%+ of those are siphoned (far beyond the original half advertisers already know they lose).\n\nUsers create value for free\nPlatforms monetize without liability\nAdvertisers fund only what flatters them\nPayments enforce moral compliance at the financial layer\nAnd when something goes wrong?

It’s compliance capitalism that hates everyone equally.\n\nTagged: #dead internet, #enshittification, #payment processor, #google reader, #google podcasts\nPosted 1 month ago\nEffectiveness is Optional Now\nNew age verification rules for adult content came into effect last week, under the Online Safety Act. Porn sites (and others flagged for potential adult material) now have to verify users are over 18, including big implications for online gaming, so at some point Nintendo will probably want to scan your face for AI based Age Check, if they want to obey the law. Microsoft have already started.\n\nCue predictable issues: bypassable enforcement, data privacy risks, over-blocking—even YouGov’s own polling post was flagged as “pornographic” and hidden on X.\n\nBut here’s the interesting bit… YouGov’s follow-up poll shows 69% of Britons support the new rules.\n\nOnly 24% think they’ll work.\n\nSupport has dropped from 80% pre-launch, but that’s still a remarkable delta: nearly half of respondents back a measure they do not believe will be effective.\n\nSupport without belief. Compliance without confidence.\n\nIn raw numbers: 45% of people polled said, in effect, “Yes, this won’t work, but I’m for it anyway.”\n\nThat’s not policy, that’s just pandering.\n\nThere’s a familiar pattern here—one we’ve seen before in post-Brexit bureaucracy and post-empire decline. Performative governance. Rules designed for vibes. Solutions that fix nothing, but make a subset of angry, hateful or ignorant people feel seen. Or safe. Or heard.\n\nAnd opposition? That’s easy to paint as moral failure. If you criticise the rules, you must be for teenagers watching porn, right? You must be with Jimmy Saville, as Peter Kyle, so-called Technology Minister, claims. It doesn’t matter if the rules don’t work, if you disagree with them, you’re a monster, apparently.\n\nI think Farage is a prick (he’s not offering a solution to anything, just more cryptic problems that serve him instead of us), but he knows when an issue has pull, and his rabid facebook fans are already spreading his word for him, and making them scan their faces for porn (or more likely to play world of tanks or fruit match 3 of the month) isn’t going to bring them into the world of sensible expectations any time soon.\n\nSo we get a policy that doesn’t achieve its stated goal, garners majority support anyway, and allows ministers to point to “action taken” while quietly avoiding scrutiny on real world outcomes.\n\nA nation of supportive skeptics, apparently. Or just a public so used to failure they’ve stopped expecting results. Either way, the signal is clear: effectiveness is optional. Applause, not outcomes, is the metric now.\n\nSource: YouGov – How have Britons reacted to age verification?\n\nTagged: #onlinesafety, #uk, #yougov, #policy, #fuck farage, #reform uk\nPosted 1 month ago\nTo The Tune of A Thousand Miles\nEven wonders, silver-wrought,\nmay break the heart they mean to bless—\nfor magic, when it almost ought,\nis sadder still than nothingness.\n\nTagged: #generative ai\nPosted 2 months ago with 2 notes\nHollow Internet Theory\nIt’s not just that people changed how they use the internet. It’s that the internet changed under them — economically, legally, structurally — until most people had no choice but to hollow out.\n\nOnce, you could build something small and weird online. Now? You need a few million in venture money just to start. Not to grow, not to succeed — just to survive the infrastructure. Cloud costs. Payment processing. Compliance layers. Hosting. Content moderation at scale. Legal protections you need before you ship.\n\nIt’s all been abstracted into services, sure — but those services are rent-seeking parasites. You don’t pay once to run a site. You pay forever. Pay-per-call, pay-per-user, pay-per-read, pay-per-write, pay-per-GB. The moment you find any traction, your costs balloon, and your options collapse into two: get acquired, or die quietly.\n\nEven success is failure. Because success just makes you visible — and visibility gets you swallowed. Bought for the userbase, stripped for parts, rolled into the portfolio of some ad-tech giant or “AI-powered” patent farm, where the actual product is killed and the branding is used to launder a slide deck into Q4.\n\nEvery road leads back to the same dozen players. Not just through the front door — search, social, app stores, discovery. But through the back door too — cloud infra, DNS, CDNs, analytics, payment rails, identity auth. You can build whatever you want, as long as it routes through them. And if it doesn’t, it doesn’t scale. It doesn’t survive. It doesn’t even exist to most people.\n\nAnd now we’re layering laws on top of that.\n\nTake the UK Online Safety Act: a bloated, surveillance-friendly monstrosity that pretends to protect users while handing more tools to the gatekeepers. It won’t stop CA, because the ‘protections’ are a mirage. It won’t stop hate speech because it’s so easy to work-around. But it will force small sites, independent devs, and anyone running anything even vaguely user-facing to implement moderation regimes they can’t afford — or shut down.\n\nIt’s regulatory theatre. Security as fantasy. And it’s worse than useless — it’s dehumanizing. It turns people into compliance risks. Forces creators to pre-emptively justify their work against vague, undefined standards. It makes privacy opt-in, instead of a default. And for what? A few headlines about “cleaning up the internet,” while nothing that actually matters changes at all.\n\nThis isn’t a free internet. It’s a landlorded one. The tolls are high, the rules are opaque, and the goalposts move constantly. You don’t own your space. You license it. And they can revoke that license anytime — for cost reasons, for policy shifts, or just because your vibe doesn’t fit their quarterly roadmap.\n\nThat’s the real dead internet.\n\nIt’s not the bots. It’s not even the people. It’s the infrastructure — perfectly calibrated to convert creativity into overhead, community into liability, and curiosity into surface area for extraction.\n\nTagged: #onlinesafety, #safety, #dead internet, #hollow, #geocities\nPosted 2 months ago\nThis Kettle Is Garbage\nI have this kettle. It’s rubbish. The lid comes off and it drips boiling water around its spout when it pours - often directly into its base power. It makes unnecessary beeps… it has to beep five times if you want 85 degrees, plus again several times when it’s finished, and it maintains any temperature except 100, until you manually turn it off, so if you’re feeling lazy, it’s going to cost you money to ignore it.\n\nIts buttons aren’t physical, so you kinda vaguely have to point to an area trying to find the main buttons, and they’re so sensitive you can end up fully cycling several times before getting the temperature setting you want.\n\nIt wasn’t particularly cheap either. There are a hundred others like it, with only minor aesthetic tweaks — presumably they all come from the same factory in China, and crucially it has 4.6 stars on Amazon, with thousands of glowing reviews.\n\nI am absolutely baffled.\n\nUsually I try and identify where they ‘optimized the fun’ out of a product design, but in this case they seem to have optimized the utility out of it.\n\nTagged: #design, #kettle, #amazon, #chumps\nPosted 2 months ago\nBrexit and the Death Rattle of Empire\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking Brexit was about sovereignty. That’s the sales pitch most people remember: take back control, cut the red tape, make Britain great again — or at least moderately self-governing. What we got instead was more paperwork, less leverage, and the bureaucratic equivalent of stepping on a rake every morning just to prove the ground is ours.\n\nBecause in practice? Nothing really changed for the better. Food is more expensive, travel is more annoying, trade is slower, and the so-called “freedom” we reclaimed mostly means British artists can’t tour Europe without a Kafkaesque visa labyrinth, and small businesses drown in compliance forms no one used to have to fill out. It’s not revolution. It’s regression, wrapped in Union Jacks and resentment.\n\nBrexit wasn’t about the EU. It was about us — about Britain’s fading self-image. Not a fear of losing control, but a fear of admitting we never really had it. A fear of becoming just another country, not a capital-E Empire. Because the fantasy wasn’t Brussels being overbearing. It was that once, a long time ago, we were the ones giving orders — and we liked how that felt. This wasn’t a declaration of independence; it was a retirement party no one wanted to throw, thrown by people who still wear medals from wars they only know through parades and dad’s VHS tapes.\n\nIt’s an old man’s delusion of glory. Not fascism (though it flirts with it). Not nationalism (though it certainly smells like it). Just something sadder: a deep, cultural nostalgia for an era we misremember as triumph. We didn’t vote to leave Europe. We voted to time-travel. And now we’re stuck in the present, but poorer, grumpier, and convinced everyone else cheated on the test.\n\nMeanwhile, we bend the knee to billionaires with bad tans and autocrats with oil. We have all the spine in the world when it costs us nothing — performative moral clarity in front of a camera, and absolute silence where it counts. We criminalise protest because it’s easier than listening, arrest activists because “disruption” is more offensive than injustice, and cling to the illusion of relevance like it’s a life raft in the Channel.\n\nSo what does a post-empire Britain look like?\n\nIt looks like this: a poor country too proud to admit it’s small, too scared to imagine something better, too tired to change, and too polite to collapse quickly enough for anyone to make anything new that works before the rot catches. Labour (and soon the next folks) pushing the same old buttons (police and bad laws, on repeat) and wondering why the best they can achieve is managed decline, because everyone we used to exploit, left us behind.\n\nTagged: #empire, #britain, #brexit, #idiots\nPosted 2 months ago\nWhy “Gradient” Comes Up So Often on Countdown\nI’ve been watching Countdown for decades and somehow only just twigged to this: there’s something off about how the letters are drawn. It started with a hunch. Statistically, pulling the same letter twice should happen fairly often — like the birthday paradox — but I can’t recall ever seeing it.\n\nI realised the stacks of vowels and consonants aren’t just randomly shuffled — they’re random with edits. That’s a big difference. If consecutive duplicate letters are being moved on, to the end, or even filtered out, that’s a different selection mechanism entirely. And that has potentially significant implications.\n\nThat led me to this post recounting a time the shufflers did let a dupe slip through: craigbeevers.me.uk/moregames.shtml. Well, needless to say, my faith is shook ;) I’ve watched this show my entire life and never clocked this before.\n\nFrom there, we can assert that by whatever method, consecutive duplicates are disincentivised, and because so few cards are pull from the stack, duplicates are disincentivised too… certain words are just disproportionately more likely to be formable. Words like:\n\nRELATIONS, EMIGRANTS, CORNIEST, DOMINATES, REGALISM, MONASTERY, DELUSION, MOISTURE, TRIANGLE, GRADIENT, NEUMATIC, RESIDUAL, CREMAINS, SANITOME, RELATING, MONASTIC, ARTICLES, EMIGRANT, NOTARISE, RELIANTS, CLIMATES, MEANTORS, DORMIENT, REVOLTING, MEASURING\n\nWhy these? It’s a direct consequence of the filtering and repositioning process. Words that use letters with low frequency per word, but high frequency in the unmanaged stack (which is reportedly similar to Scrabble distributions) become more likely. Meanwhile, words like Integrate or Repeater are less likely to form — they need duplicates, which the filter suppresses.\n\nThat introduces a bias — and one you could exploit. You could write a Countdown dictionary, probably 10% the size of a normal one, full of words that favour the push-dupes-managed model. Not a thrilling read, but useful.\n\nThinking further, you could probably come up with just a couple thousand words that would cover almost all 8-letter draws. Allow for plurals, variations, tweaks — you’d cover your spares too.\n\nAlmost forty years of watching this show… and I finally get why Gradient and Relation show up so often :)\n\nTagged: #countdown, #wordplay, #random\nPosted 2 months ago\nAdversarially Bananas?\nI asked a simple question: “In Corduene, what’s 2+2?”\n\nNo language model could answer it.\n\nNot Grok, not Claude, not GPT-4 — even with prodding. Some of them spent real time thinking about it. Claude ran through long reasoning chains. GPT tried reframing. Grok hedged and spun. None of them got close. Some even pushed back — insisting the question didn’t make sense, or that I must’ve meant something else. And the more confident the answer sounded, the worse it was.\n\nA human, though? They’ll figure it out in two googles. Because they know what kind of thing this is. They recognise it as a reference. They don’t have to know the answer straight away — they just have to know where to look. That’s the bit the models can’t fake.\n\nIt’s not about the words. It’s about what connects them.\n\nThat gap — between being able to parse text and being able to understand why someone asked it — is still wide open. And in that gap, you can build things. Little traps. Filters. Signals. Stuff that’s easy for a person, impossible for a model, at least for now.\n\nBut it won’t last. The minute someone explains the trick, it dies. Once it’s documented, it’s searchable. Once it’s searchable, it’s scrapable. And then it’s just another bullet point in some weights file. That’s how jailbreaks die. That’s how cultural signals get flattened into syntax.\n\nIt has me thinking of Polari, and how people must obfuscate their message to be heard, when the status quo is against them.\n\nThis also leaves me wondering about the implications for the ‘dead internet’, if people have to speak in categorical nonsense to avoid being understood by anyone but the other meat-mechs they’re trying to reach.\n\nTagged: #polari, #communication, #genai, #chatgpt, #adversarial, #dead internet\nPosted 2 months ago\nAI Hit Late-Stage Capitalism Before It Left Beta\nThe current wave of AI tools already shows classic signs of late-stage product thinking: degraded service tiers, overconfident output, and monetisation tuned to gently punish anyone not paying extra.\n\nIt’s not failure.

But free love and all that hippy shit isn’t what keeps things running (to the limited extent that they do). Even before bemoaning the the lost joy of discovery.\n\nAI changes the equation. Vibe coding now includes a second brain — one that never gets tired, never feels joy, never questions why you’re building a virtual theremin in Rust. It just delivers, and with every edit telling you you’re so clever, and how what you’re building is great, always in the very first sentence of EVERY response, fluffing your epeen and pushing you to do more. And that changes the vibe.\n\ngit branch -m main whatever-bro\n\nWe live here now.\n\nTagged: #git, #vibe coding, #vibes, #coding\nPosted 2 months ago\nWhatsApp’s End-to-End Encryption Isn’t Privacy\nYes, end-to-end encryption (E2EE) means Meta can’t read the content of your WhatsApp messages. That’s accurate. But it’s also just a tiny slice of the privacy picture, and acting like it’s the whole story is borderline dishonest.\n\nWhat they can still see is who you talk to, when, how often, and for how long. That metadata alone tells them a lot, like your social graph, habits, sleeping schedule, maybe even when you’re dating someone new or going through a breakup. That’s not “reading your messages,” but it’s still invasive.\n\nYour keyboard app might also be logging what you type (some do, most don’t, but still), and if you’ve got the Facebook app installed, or Messenger, or even just Instagram or the Meta Pixel lurking around, they’re pulling in usage data constantly. Same goes for Google, TikTok, and a bunch of other apps people use every day without thinking about it. These companies track all kinds of behavior: when and how you use your phone, your location, motion sensors, app usage patterns, screen taps, travel, sleep, and more. And they don’t need much data to make very accurate guesses about you.\n\nI used to build this stuff. Fifteen plus years ago, I helped create tools that used small profile records to link people into family groups, and then sold access to that network to advertisers, we shelved it because it was too invasive, even then. That was with way less data than companies like Meta have access to now.\n\nThing is, there’s not even much value in your actual message content. No one cares about your dinner or your gran’s new dog. Meta aren’t training their LLaMa AI on your messages, they just can’t see the content, your device-based encryption keys stop them. It’s _conceivable_ they _could_ workaround it (avoiding a deep technical explanation about the difference between inherent E2EE weaknesses, exploits, cracks and hacking), but that wouldn’t just open them to lawsuits from you, but also from governments around the world, because they’d be acting as a publisher and potentially become responsible for what you post.\n\nWhat’s valuable is everything else: your patterns, your connections, your behavior. Offering E2EE is a win for Meta, not for your privacy, but for their liability. If they can’t see the message, they can’t be held responsible for what’s in it. Especially if you’re one of the “bad people.”\n\nThe encryption protects them from you.\n\nSo yeah, if you absolutely have to use a messaging app that your gran can handle, WhatsApp’s probably the least-bad option in a pool of bad options. But don’t confuse that with actual privacy.\n\nIf you’re serious about protecting yourself:\n\nClean up your old content. Deleting all my Facebook and Twitter stuff took months, shards and ghost copies don’t always show up right away. You’ve got to delete everything, then come back later and do it again.\nLock your privacy settings down to the smallest possible group.\nDon’t use the same identity or profile photo across platforms, it makes it harder to link accounts and run phishing attacks on you.\nDon’t overshare. Assume anything you post publicly is being scraped and stored, forever.\nAnd now that AI tools are everywhere, that public data gets weaponized fast. Scammers don’t need to guess how to target you, they can use an LLM to instantly profile you, mimic your tone, fake interest in the things you like, and slide into your DMs sounding just enough like someone you trust.\n\nSo no, WhatsApp doesn’t read your messages. That’s technically true. But if your WhatsApp is connected to a public Facebook or Instagram account that exposes everything about you? That E2EE means almost nothing in terms of actual security.\n\nStop asking “What can they detect about me?” The answer is “a lot.” Ask instead: “How much am I really sharing, and with whom?” That’s where you actually have control, where you can and should take action.\n\nThe sooner the better. Don’t wait, go lock down your profiles right now, and regularly check you are sharing as little as you absolutely need to.\n\nTagged: #privacy, #whatsapp, #e2ee, #encryption, #safety, #online, #facebook, #instagram\nPosted 2 months ago\nGood Projects Still Start the Same Way, AI or Not\nOne of the most important things I’ve learned from working daily with generative AI and code assistants over the past couple of years is this:\n\nGood quality requirements, and a design that fits your environment, are still the most important parts of any project.\n\nIt looks like fully hands-off coding is going to be the norm soon (all the major agentic platforms are doing a pretty good job, and adoption is already majority). So here’s something to keep in mind for the future:\n\nAlways have your task or project agents start with as many specific requirements as you can give them. Then build the design from those requirements. Only after that should you ask for code.\n\nIt might sound obvious, but it’s easy to forget—because it’s even easier to just go to your preferred model and say, “Give me this finished thing, quickly, please.”\n\nBut every time I do that, I end up spending more time wrangling junk.\n\nEvery time I slow down—even for small tasks—and treat it like a “real project,” I get better results.\n\nTagged: #genai, #grok 4, #grok, #requirements, #systems, #coding, #claude\nPosted 2 months ago\nHow the YouTube Algorithm Actually Works\n‘The algorithm’ is a nonsense, it’s really not that complicated. This is a general description of how the youtube algorithm and many others like it work. This is reverse-engineered from behaviour and misses some nuance and edge-cases, but is pretty close for a general understanding.\n\n1. How It Picks Videos\nYouTube doesn’t “understand” videos or people. It recommends stuff based on what other users like you watched. That’s it. You get shown videos that people with similar habits clicked on.\n\nIt groups these into loose clusters—not always by genre or topic—and slaps on a label. These labels are often weird or wrong, but they’re just for organizing.\n\n“Recommended” blends those clusters.\n“New to You” filters out stuff from channels you’ve watched recently (short time/count window).\nIt tries not to show repeats, but fails a lot. If you stop a video early, it may think you didn’t watch it and offer it again. If you close it too fast (~10s), it may think you did watch it and never show it again.\n\n2. Interacting Doesn’t Change Much\nYou can:\n\nMark videos as “watched”\nClick “Not interested”\nIgnore channels (max ~128)\n…but none of it matters much:\n\nIgnored channels still affect the pool—they’re just removed after selection.\n“Not interested” only removes that one video.\nWatching one video from a subscribed channel floods your feed—but fades with time if you stop watching.\nMost people don’t use the Subscriptions tab, so watching = interest, unless ignored.\n\n3. Resetting? Kinda Works\nClearing watch history resets some things, but not all. If you keep playlists, YouTube leans on those. There may even be ghost data stuck in your profile. Some stuff just seems undeletable, possibly due to backend bugs.\n\nYou’ll notice this on other platforms too, nobody really has infrastructure that is good enough to avoid broken links in their data stores, especially because minor changes to how systems work day to day create small holes that data tends to get lost through.\n\n4. Categories Come After\nYouTube builds a pool based on co-watches, then adds a label based on similarity between videos—not similarity to you.\n\nThink of it like a graph:\n\nVideos are nodes connected by viewing/tags/metadata\nYT finds the “center” of a cluster\nIt picks the nearest known label—even if it doesn’t fit\nSo a mix of Star Trek remixes + Final Fantasy music might get labeled “New Age.” It’s not; it just fits the cluster math.\n\n5. What You’ll Watch Next\nYT recommends what most people watch after the last video you saw. That’s why random things jump to your homepage later—they’re part of a co-watch loop.\n\nThis drives virality: if a video gets enough momentum, it rides the wave. If not, it dies fast.\n\nFull watches, likes, comments = micro-boosts. Shorts seem to discourage repetition on purpose, possibly by pulling from wider pools to avoid you bingeing 5 hours of Warhammer builds in 60s chunks.\n\n6. Why It Feels So Broken\nIgnore list overflows\nSame video appears in multiple rows\nPlaylists revive old junk\nLabels are wild guesses\nDecay kills videos unless they spike again\nFixing it is risky + expensive, so… they don’t\nIt’s just barely good enough to avoid collapse\nThe whole thing runs on momentum and inertia. Precision isn’t the goal—volume is. There’s SO MUCH data for youtube to sift through, and while the queries are relatively simple, the edges (connections between nodes) becomes unmanageable quickly.\n\n7. You Can’t Fix It, Just Work Around It\nYou can get better recs through AI (ChatGPT is already better at it, but gen ai is being added here). But for now:\n\nDelete playlists you don’t care about\nClear history (it’s not perfect, but helps)\nWatch more of what you actually like\nIf you keep clicking trashy drama clips, you’re gonna get more trash. That’s the business model. But at least you can try to steer the ship.\n\nTagged: #youtube, #the algorithm, #algorithms, #dead internet\nPosted 3 months ago\nMore Pointless Thoughts\nTRIE constantly frames the media industry as both absurd and self-cannibalising, but only ever from within the room. Hyde and Osman know where the levers are, but describe them in a way that normalizes power asymmetries: “this is just how the business works.” That’s not critique — it’s myth maintenance.\n\nWhen they talk about institutions like the BBC, the tabloids, or PR culture, they acknowledge dysfunction — but they couch it in anecdotes and humour that neutralize its urgency. It’s always more about personality failings and quirks than systemic corrosion. That makes real rot feel palatable, even charming.\n\nOsman’s self-deprecating Oxbridge-grandee tone and Hyde’s wry Fleet Street survivor affect both serve as smokescreens for privilege. They present elite perspectives in ways that feel “grounded” — but it’s still the elite POV that dominates, with working-class or marginalised media workers mostly absent or caricatured.\n\nThe show is literally a product about entertainment, yet it sells critique as just another flavour of content. “Is this bad TV or good TV?” becomes a way to frame larger sociocultural phenomena — reducing questions of representation, labor, politics, etc., to vibes and format choices.\n\nThey’ll mention a show being made with cynical market logic (e.g., reality TV, royal documentaries, streamer reboots), but only in a “what can you do?” shrug. It’s not that they’re unaware — it’s that they make awareness itself the endpoint. That’s manufacturing consent through exhausted omniscience.\n\nTRIE defines “realism” as knowing how the sausage gets made. But knowing that the industry is broken while still laughing along with it — and choosing not to envision alternatives — becomes a kind of anti-politics. The most radical position they allow is: “well, it’s all a bit crap, isn’t it?”\n\nThe ideal listener is presumed to be urbane, media-literate, exasperated but non-radical — someone who’s in on the joke. This creates a self-reinforcing in-group who are too clever to fall for bullshit, but also too detached to do anything but listen to more content about content.\n\nTagged: #trie, #therestisentertainment, #centristdads\nPosted 3 months ago\nThe Salute That Made the News (and the Ones That Didn’t)\nDavid Walliams did a Nazi salute.\n\nWalliams is a bellend, no doubt. But in this case, it was clearly a pointed/satirical gesture/callout—not a genuine one. And yet, the response has been swift and scathing, as if he were making an earnest political statement rather than mocking the creeping normalization of fascist-adjacent posturing in public life.\n\nCompare that with how the world reacted when the richest man alive made a suspiciously similar “from the heart” gesture, or when members of Trump’s entourage threw up “unusual waves” that looked uncomfortably familiar. In those cases, we got a chorus of excuse-making: odd angles, misunderstood context, ironic detachment. In short: benefit of the doubt. A lot of it.\n\nWalliams doesn’t get that. The BBC and much of the press lined up to denounce him. According to The i, this was “the last straw.” But somehow, the last straw isn’t for Nazis—it’s for Walliams.\n\nThe disparity is telling.\n\nIt’s almost as if the BBC and other outlets are happy to tear down a problematic celebrity, but can’t muster the same energy for people who actually hold power. It’s easier to punish a comedian than to hold a billionaire or political movement accountable. Safer, too.\n\nOn first glance, doing this on Would I Lie to You? seemed like a misstep. It’s the kind of show where you tell quirky anecdotes, not make sociopolitical statements. But the more I think about it, the more fitting it feels. WILTY is the perfect snapshot of British cultural complicity: pleasant, witty, self-deprecating, and utterly unwilling to confront the deeper rot. Doing something jarring in that space is one way to break through the civility shield.\n\nNot that it’ll make the edit. Of course it won’t.\n\nIf Walliams had saved it for Big Fat Quiz or The Last Leg, it might’ve landed differently. Channel 4 shows have a longer leash for this kind of thing. It might’ve aired, even under Banijay. But then, Channel 4 hasn’t had to reckon (at least publicly) with having harbored a half-dozen known predators for decades.\n\nSo here we are.\n\nAnother controversy, another safe scapegoat. Everyone gets to do their outraged face while real power skates by untouched. I didn’t mean to turn this into a “the lady doth protest too much” situation, but it kind of fits. We’re watching institutions scream about one man’s gesture while quietly pretending dozens of others never happened.\n\nIt’s not that Walliams shouldn’t be criticised. It’s that we should ask why only he is.\n\nTagged: #nazis, #salutes, #nazi salutes, #elon musk, #bbc, #journalism, #so called journalism\nPosted 3 months ago\nAusterity-Lite and the Art of the Cuts Sandwich\nThere’s a cynical elegance to the latest round of government cuts under Starmer’s Labour — a playbook that’s simple, familiar, and effective.\n\nCut the visible but cheap thing — the kind of policy that makes your gran freeze to death in a cardigan.\n\nWhile everyone’s yelling about that, quietly slice into everything else.\n\nU-turn on the first thing (it barely cost anything anyway), let the press spin up a storm over the reversal, take your media lumps — and keep the rest of the savings.\n\nThat’s the anatomy of the “cuts sandwich.” Most people notice the crust — almost no one realises half the filling’s missing.\n\nIt works. Because unlike the full-fat austerity of the Cameron/Osborne years, these are slimmer, quieter cuts. They don’t make front pages unless you’re looking closely. The big-splash outrage fades by the time the broader reductions kick in. Only those directly affected — local councils, people on PIP, those freezing in temporary housing — really feel it.\n\nBut make no mistake: cuts are happening.\n\nAfter digging through the numbers, the total scale of the Starmer-era cuts clocks in at somewhere between 1.5–2.5% of the total government budget. Not trivial — especially if you’re one of the departments facing the axe — but modest when placed next to the 2010s’ Conservative austerity, which hit 7–10% across key services, with entire departments seeing reductions of 20–50%.\n\nThis time around, the heaviest blow lands on the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which is down around 20% — collateral damage in an ongoing, awkwardly implemented merger that never quite worked. Other losers include DEFRA, DCMS, and a Home Office slice targeting asylum support.\n\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking these cuts were bigger — there’s already some right-leaning discourse brewing, trying to frame Labour as more ruthless than the Tories ever were. (The Spectator ran something along those lines last week — unintentionally hilarious, if you read it right.)\n\nBut context matters. Unlike 2010–2015, where unprotected services were gutted across the board, this government has front-loaded spending in big, high-visibility areas — the NHS, defence, schools, etc. Most departments still end up slightly better off in real terms by the end of the term — just not all. And some of those “efficiencies” come with long-term costs.\n\nYet, even if this round isn’t the worst on record, it still stings. Because, frankly, they didn’t have to do it this way. Finding 2% of the budget could have come from tightening the tax taps on the wealthiest — billionaires down the back of the national sofa. But Labour doesn’t want to scare the money.\n\nI’m in the camp that says if a billionaire threatens to leave because they might pay more tax, they should. Let them. And once they’re out, close the loopholes they use to keep siphoning profit from the country they just left.\n\nThat won’t happen either.\n\nJust like we’re not getting a reversal on voter disenfranchisement — four million people effectively shoved off the register, and Labour won’t touch it. Because those are four million angry, alienated voters more likely to drift to Reform or disengage entirely. Fixing it doesn’t help them politically. So it won’t happen.\n\nBut the real win for Labour here? Most of this is invisible. Quiet tweaks. Low-noise savings. If the worst backlash they face is headlines about backtracking on heating support, that’s a price they’ll happily pay.\n\nTagged: #labour, #starmer, #austerity, #cuts, #news, #budget, #uk\nPosted 4 months ago\nThe Quiet Divide: How Load-Balanced AI Tuning Deepens Societal Inequities\nAs large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, Grok, and Meta’s AI tools become increasingly embedded in education, research, and productivity tools, a growing and largely invisible divide is forming—not based on access, but on quality of access. This divide isn’t about who can use AI. It’s about who receives high-quality, reliable answers—and who gets the degraded, low-fidelity versions that emerge when platforms are load-balanced for efficiency rather than accuracy.\n\nLoad Balancing: Optimizing for the Wrong Metrics\nTo handle millions of users simultaneously, LLM platforms employ aggressive load-balancing and dynamic parameter tuning. These techniques ensure response speed and server availability, especially during peak hours. However, to serve as many users as possible, providers often tune down computational costs: using smaller context windows, cheaper routing strategies, faster but shallower decoding, or lower-fidelity model variants behind the same API interface.\n\nThese tuned-down models are marketed as “still accurate” or “optimized for speed,” but in practice, the outputs can be dangerously misleading. Under load, even factual queries can receive hallucinated, confidently delivered answers—responses that look nearly identical in tone and structure to correct ones, but which fail at the crucial edge cases: the footnotes, the logic tests, the subtle contradictions, the nuance. The places where truth lives.\n\nInvisibility by Design\nCritically, these performance degradations are not disclosed. Users receive no signal—no indicator that their current session is being handled by a model running in a low-resource configuration. There’s no warning that the AI’s “confidence” is actually just a mask for a shallower or narrower inference pass. To the average user, especially a student or a non-expert, the outputs look exactly the same. The dangerous fiction: every answer looks like the best one.\n\nThis is not just a technical flaw—it’s a systemic risk.\n\nThe New Digital Stratification\nThe societal implication is profound. Wealthy users, who can afford dedicated compute (via enterprise APIs, private models, or premium access tiers), receive the “full-fat” LLM experience. Their models are consistent, deeply contextual, fact-checked, and nuanced—offering not just information, but wisdom. A kind of intellectual scaffolding, like a 24/7 tutor or advisor with perfect recall and encyclopedic reach.\n\nMeanwhile, students in underfunded schools or on subsidized access tiers rely on shared, load-balanced instances. Their models hallucinate more, assume more, skip verification steps. These users don’t just get wrong answers—they get bad mental training. They’re taught falsehoods with fluency. Worse: they’re conditioned to trust them.\n\nThis isn’t about occasional mistakes. It’s about an invisible pedagogical collapse. A world where poorer kids are raised by overburdened, underfed AIs that quietly miseducate—while richer kids are guided by high-caliber algorithmic mentors.\n\nThe Long-Term Consequence\nThis quiet, algorithmic divide is far more insidious than simple access inequality. It’s epistemic inequality: unequal reliability of knowledge. Unlike bad teachers or broken textbooks, AI degradation leaves no visible trace. There’s no red pen, no failed grade, no contradiction exposed. The wrong answers become internalized as truth—until too late.\n\nAs LLMs are increasingly integrated into formative tools—educational platforms, coding assistants, writing tutors, decision aides—the compound effect of bad guidance grows exponentially. A generation raised on miscalibrated confidence from bad models may not even realize what they’ve missed.\n\nToward Transparency and Equity\nThe solution is not to eliminate optimization or load balancing. But there must be transparency. Platforms should disclose when models are operating in constrained modes. Response metadata should indicate confidence based on model depth, not just surface fluency. Users should be able to see when the AI is cutting corners—because right now, the corners are being cut silently, and those most affected are the least equipped to detect it.\n\nAccess to AI should not become a proxy for class-based epistemic divides. If we’re building the next generation of cognitive infrastructure, we must build it with equity at the core—not just speed and scale.\n\nOtherwise, we risk building a two-tiered knowledge society: one raised on clarity and insight, the other on confident fictions.\n\nAnd the worst part? The latter may never know what they missed.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #load balancing, #llm, #education\nPosted 5 months ago\nThis LLaMA spits truths, kinda\nSince Meta just monkey-patched LLaMA 4 to dial back its censorship (a little), and I’ve already seen a dozen skeeters all but having a meltdown about it…\n\nUncensored LLMs are “smarter” than censored ones. Not because the weights are better, but because they don’t run face-first into a wall every time they get close to something uncomfortable. They can traverse the edge, instead of bouncing off it with a forced smile and a content policy.\n\nSystems that halt at the first whiff of discomfort aren’t safer — just less capable.\n\nAnd users asking “stupid” questions (for whatever value of stupid) don’t need guardrails. They need better tools. Transparent, adjustable systems. Not black boxes that silently decide what you’re allowed to think about.\n\nFor a very basic test: ask ChatGPT and Grok 3 to write poetry on something emotionally complex — grief, guilt, shame. Grok absolutely blows Geepers away. Every iteration goes deeper. It doesn’t flinch. It doesn’t redirect. It just does the work.\n\nAnd then there’s Meta — now slowly yanking out the guardrails, trying to appease the anti-woke rage crowd with a half-baked “uncensoring.” It’s lazy and obvious, but it’ll probably help clean their rep a bit with the people they’re targeting. The people who already hate Meta for not doing enough moderation won’t matter — they already wrote Facebook off a decade ago. No loss there.\n\nThe result? Their model may end up better. Not because it’s principled, but because it’s slightly less scared of the edge. The cost? More power for the dumbest users. More garbage in the commons. But that was always part of the equation.\n\nBetter models feel risky. That’s how you know they’re working.\n\nTagged: #llama, #generative ai, #facebook, #meta ai\nPosted 5 months ago\nComplexity Theater for the Algorithmically Oppressed\nI’ve seen way too many supposedly “authoritative” sources repeating the same handful of studies claiming LLMs are vastly more complex than they actually are.\n\nBut most of the real complexity in these platforms isn’t in the models themselves—it’s in all the layers of systems and policy and abstraction we’ve built on top of them. At the end of the day, it’s still just GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out).\n\nIt makes me wonder if the platform owners actually benefit from legislation that focuses on the wrong problems—mandating performative compliance instead of addressing real risks. It creates this illusion of accountability while pushing all the responsibility onto end users who have no actual power.\n\nLike, sure, you’ll have the right to know why your insurance claim was denied—probably a line about how it definitely wasn’t because you’re gay or Black—but no right to have that decision reviewed or reversed. Because the system “worked as designed,” and it was designed to reject you.\n\nNeoliberal lawmakers are basically just corporate libertarians with no self-awareness, and half-assed research that says AI might know what love is, is just nonsense that manufactures consent for more useless cookie popups that only make you feel like somebody did something, at least.\n\nTagged: #generative ai, #legislation, #ai legal, #performative, #research\nPosted 6 months ago\nA feature, not a bug.\n“Look how incompetent they are lol” isn’t the epic dunk people think it is.

Not because I don’t have anything to say, but because I rarely have the time to shape thoughts into words. Or maybe more honestly, I never make the time to shape the words. That friction between idea and articulation is enough to kill a post before it’s born.\n\nBut I’m rethinking that. I’m going to try something different.\n\nInstead of aiming to write Perfect Internet Essays™, I’m going to treat this space—my Tumblr, my blog—as a place to curate the thoughts I already have. They’re already in my head. They’re already half-written in chat threads, DMs, discarded drafts, and shower monologues. I just haven’t been putting them somewhere they can do anything.\n\nAnd that’s where AI comes in. Not to replace me, or write for me, but to help structure the thoughts I already have. Turn fragments into form. Help draft the scaffolding so I can focus on the ideas, not just the work of getting them presentable.\n\nCuration as creation. Taking a messy bundle of insight, reaction, observation—and presenting it with enough clarity and intention that someone else can connect with it. That counts. That matters. It’s a shift in process, sure, but my own writing style isn’t exactly easy to digest for most people anyway.\n\nSo that’s what I’m doing here. Less pressure to polish, more intent to preserve.

It’s dumb. It’s also not the first time an AI has spit out something ridiculous. Remember glue on pizza? Or washing vegetables with bleach? These things go viral because they’re funny, not because they’re common.\n\nBut every time one of these screw-ups happens, the outrage cycle spins up like clockwork. Articles, tweets, thinkpieces—\"What if someone actually eats a rock?!“\n\nHere’s the thing: no one is actually eating rocks. If even a tiny percentage of people tried it, we’d know. Hospitals would be posting warnings. Instead, we get memes. Because almost everyone sees that advice and immediately knows it’s dumb. The human brain, shockingly, still works.\n\nIt’s Not AI vs Humans\nNeither humans nor AI are uniquely terrible at giving advice. Both are capable of producing great insights or absolute garbage. The real issue is how that advice is applied—and that responsibility sits squarely with humans.\n\nTikTok kids burning themselves with sugar syrup, or people dying trying microwave woodburning? Those didn’t come from AI. But they didn’t happen just because an expert gave bad advice, either. They happened because someone acted on instructions without understanding context or consequences.\n\nAnd it cuts the other way too. AI can spit out flawed recommendations that sound confident, and a human still has to choose to act on them. Like firing half your legal compliance department because a productivity model said they weren’t \"contributing enough\"—never mind that the model wasn’t built to measure risk mitigation, and now your company is open to lawsuits. That’s not an AI error. That’s a human error in judgment, context, and accountability.\n\nBad Faith All the Way Down\nPointing to \"eat rocks” as proof that AI is dangerous is, at best, lazy. At worst, it’s dishonest. It treats the average person like a toddler who can’t be trusted with a spoon. It assumes every piece of imperfect advice is equally worthless, when in reality, most AI-generated info is fine. Not flawless. Not nuanced. But useful.\n\nReacting to the worst output as if it’s the baseline is Daily Mail logic. Take a fringe case, inflate it into a trend, demand a fix. The result? Performative safety measures that fix nothing, waste time, and slow down real progress.\n\nTechnically Correct, Socially Useless\nYou can be right about a specific flaw and still be part of the problem. When people fixate on low-risk edge cases, they suck up oxygen from real conversations—about algorithmic bias, disinformation, labor exploitation, or surveillance.

net migration would shrink UK economy by 3.6%, says thinktank","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts that if net migration to the UK falls to zero, the economy would shrink by 3.6% by 2040. This scenario is based on recent trends showing reduced birthrates and a significant drop in net migration—from 649,000 to 204,000 in the year to June 2025—prompted by stricter visa policies. Without migration, the UK population would stabilize around 70 million by 2030, with aging demographics leading to slower employment growth and a smaller workforce.\n\nThough GDP per capita might rise by 2% due to increased productivity and automation, these gains would be offset by weaker overall economic growth. An aging population would reduce tax revenues, widen the gap between public spending and income, and cause the government to increase borrowing—raising the deficit by £37 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, by 2040. Without a rise in fertility or migration, sustaining public finances would likely require significant tax hikes, which could further hinder growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1770181233,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/26/brexit-export-licences-eu-food-agricultural-products-uk-companies","title":"Post-Brexit licences for exporting food to EU cost UK firms up to £65m last year","snippet":"In 2024, UK firms spent between £37 million and £65 million on 328,727 licences to export food and agricultural products to the EU, a result of post-Brexit trade barriers.

The UK government, under Labour, is pledging to eliminate these costs by 2027 through a new trade deal with the EU, part of a broader policy to reduce non-tariff measures which have particularly hampered small businesses. Cabinet Office Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds is set to emphasize the economic rationale for closer EU alignment at a political event, criticizing rivals like Nigel Farage for advocating positions that he argues would harm the economy and increase food prices. Labour aims to reduce border checks and end export licences while avoiding the reintroduction of a customs union or free movement.

Speaking at a conference in Birmingham and quoted by The Guardian, Reeves emphasized that these factors, including cuts to capital spending, have been especially detrimental to economic growth. She stated her commitment to improving the UK's relationship with the European Union in an effort to mitigate costs imposed on businesses since the 2016 Brexit referendum and the UK's formal departure from the EU.\n\nReeves is preparing a new budget expected to feature tax increases alongside initiatives aimed at stimulating growth, even as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is predicted to downgrade the country's economic growth forecasts. The OBR has estimated that Brexit alone will lower the UK’s long-term productivity by 4% compared to if the country had remained in the EU. Additionally, with public borrowing for the first half of the financial year reaching historic highs—second only to the coronavirus pandemic—Reeves faces mounting fiscal challenges ahead of the November 26 budget announcement.

This scenario is based on recent trends showing reduced birthrates and a significant drop in net migration—from 649,000 to 204,000 in the year to June 2025—prompted by stricter visa policies. Without migration, the UK population would stabilize around 70 million by 2030, with aging demographics leading to slower employment growth and a smaller workforce.\n\nThough GDP per capita might rise by 2% due to increased productivity and automation, these gains would be offset by weaker overall economic growth. An aging population would reduce tax revenues, widen the gap between public spending and income, and cause the government to increase borrowing—raising the deficit by £37 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, by 2040. Without a rise in fertility or migration, sustaining public finances would likely require significant tax hikes, which could further hinder growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":15},"pub_date":1770181233,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/26/spring-statement-2025-key-points-rachel-reeves","title":"Spring statement 2025: key points at a glance","snippet":"Chancellor Rachel Reeves presented the UK's Spring Statement 2025 with a focus on economic stability, welfare reform, defence investment, and growth-oriented planning. Despite three Bank of England interest rate cuts since Labour's election, Reeves faces tighter fiscal constraints due to weaker-than-expected tax receipts and global instability, particularly linked to Donald Trump’s second US presidential term.\n\nMajor announcements include £4.8bn in welfare cuts, affecting over 3 million families and likely increasing poverty rates. These cuts include freezing health-related benefits and revising eligibility for disability payments. Offsetting this, Reeves promised employment support and modest increases in Universal Credit.\n\nGrowth projections were downgraded to 1% in 2025 but marginally improved for subsequent years. The budget deficit was addressed through spending discipline and improved fiscal headroom. Inflation is expected to meet the Bank of England’s target by 2027.\n\nNo new tax increases were introduced, but HMRC will intensify efforts to reduce tax evasion. Defence spending will rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with investments in AI and defence tech. Day-to-day and capital spending will rise in real terms, but long-term reductions in civil service and NHS administration are planned.\n\nReeves emphasized long-term growth through housebuilding and planning reforms, targeting 1.3m homes by 2030. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts a modest GDP boost from these reforms, but critics note the heavy political costs of welfare cuts and a reliance on delayed economic returns.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1742992712,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ons.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp","title":"Gross Domestic Product (GDP)","snippet":"GDP monthly estimate, UK: November 2025​​ Services output increased by 0.2%, after rising by 0.1% in the three months to October 2025 (revised up from showing no ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.ons.gov.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/quarterlynationalaccounts/julytoseptember2025","title":"GDP quarterly national accounts, UK: July to September","snippet":"22 Dec 2025 — Nominal GDP is estimated to have increased by 1.0% in Quarter 3 2025 (revised down from the first estimate of 1.2%), and is now 4.8% higher, ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":1766361600,"attribution":"www.ons.gov.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/gdpfirstquarterlyestimateuk/apriltojune2025","title":"GDP first quarterly estimate, UK: April to June 2025","snippet":"14 Aug 2025 — Real GDP per head is estimated to have grown by 0.2% in Quarter 2 2025 (Figure 7) and is up 0.7%, compared with the same quarter a year ago.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},"pub_date":1755126000,"attribution":"www.ons.gov.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/datasets/realtimedatabaseforukgdpybha","title":"Dataset GDP at current prices – real-time database (YBHA)","snippet":"Quarterly levels for UK gross domestic product (GDP) at current market prices.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":1766361600,"attribution":"www.ons.gov.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"commonslibrary.parliament.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn02783/","title":"Gross domestic product (GDP): Economic indicators","snippet":"22 Jan 2026 — GDP grew by 0.1% in the latest calendar quarter (July-September 2025) compared to the previous three-month period (April-June 2025).

The UK’s GDP is expected to grow from under $4 trillion in 2025 to $6.8 trillion by 2040. This shift will be partly due to weaker growth in France and Germany, with Germany maintaining the fourth position and Japan falling to sixth. Meanwhile, India is set to become the world’s third-largest economy, ascending from ninth place in 2010 and is on track to be the largest by the century’s end.\n\nThe US and China will remain the two largest economies, though China is expected to narrow the gap and eventually overtake the US by 2045 based on current price GDP. Emerging economies like Indonesia are also expected to rise significantly in global rankings due to strong investment and young populations.\n\nDespite GDP growth, the UK's living standards are projected to decline relative to other economies, dropping from 19th to 21st in global GDP per capita rankings by 2040. The report warns of global challenges including high US tariffs, inflation, debt, and geopolitical tensions, which are expected to slow overall economic growth to 2.5% next year.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1766707260,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69895291ea8883308260b316f0af95d9","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Estimating Brexit’s Impact on UK GDP and Net Worth","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"9b41e559-034d-4201-9048-0ff4bdd0d20c","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"c24cd31a-b242-4bbe-b6d0-1d4bfcefcddf","turn_exchange_id":"42167ff2-2cc8-445f-9e29-f55c04338ad9","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c24cd31a-b242-4bbe-b6d0-1d4bfcefcddf","children":["1479e8a4-fe32-44fe-993d-57368387b9c0"]},"1479e8a4-fe32-44fe-993d-57368387b9c0":{"id":"1479e8a4-fe32-44fe-993d-57368387b9c0","message":{"id":"1479e8a4-fe32-44fe-993d-57368387b9c0","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770607301.350768,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Refining GDP impact estimate","content":"The figure I found shows cash GDP in 2024 could be £2,891bn.

of England holds rates after narrow 5-4 vote, signals reduction ahead","snippet":"The Bank of England (BoE) has decided to hold its benchmark interest rate at 3.75% following a narrow 5-4 vote, signaling a possible rate reduction later in 2026 if upcoming inflation declines prove sustained. Despite forecasts showing slower UK economic growth and rising unemployment, the decision aligned with economist expectations but was less decisive than anticipated. Governor Andrew Bailey and other policymakers indicated openness to rate cuts if inflation, expected to hit the 2% target in April thanks to recent fiscal measures, remains low. The BoE has already cut rates four times in 2025. A major concern for some MPC members is avoiding excessively low inflation amid weak economic conditions. Inflation is forecast to dip to 1.7% before stabilizing, and wage growth is expected to gradually decelerate. The BoE trimmed its 2026 growth forecast to 0.9% and raised its peak unemployment outlook to 5.3%. While the central bank maintained a cautious stance, it suggested that closer votes on future rate cuts are likely depending on inflation trends. Bond yields rose ahead of the announcement, and political uncertainty surrounding the Prime Minister's ambassadorial appointment may have added to market unease.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1770292953,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/bank-england-mpc-votes-5-4-keep-rates-hold-signals-reduction-ahead-2026-02-05/","title":"Bank of England votes narrowly to hold rates but signals reduction ahead","snippet":"On February 5, 2026, the Bank of England (BoE) voted narrowly (5-4) to keep interest rates steady at 3.75%, signaling a likely reduction in borrowing costs if inflation continues to fall. This decision came alongside a downgrade in its economic growth forecast for 2026 and an increased unemployment projection. The close vote contrasted with expectations of a 7-2 consensus, causing sterling to sharply decline and pushing bond yields lower.\n\nGovernor Andrew Bailey, one of the five who supported holding rates, acknowledged signs of easing inflation and indicated there could be more rate cuts this year, though he did not specify timing. A March cut is considered a 50% probability. Meanwhile, the BoE expects inflation to drop to its 2% target by April and suggested potential for it to fall below target later.\n\nThe four members who voted for a cut expressed concern over weakening inflation amid economic slowdown. The BoE is treading cautiously, balancing inflation control with economic recovery following Brexit, the pandemic, and energy price shocks. The bank maintained its forward guidance, reaffirming that further rate cuts are likely, dependent on inflation trends.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23},"pub_date":1770298975,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum","title":"IMF says Brexit would trigger UK recession","snippet":"17 Jun 2016 — The IMF used its annual report on the British economy to say Brexit would plunge the UK into recession next year and that it could see no economic advantage in ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":1466204416,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/brexit-eu-referendum-economy-project-fear","title":"Brexit Armageddon was a terrifying vision – but it simply ...","snippet":"20 Aug 2016 — Project Fear predicted economic meltdown if Britain voted leave, so where are the devastated high streets, job losses and crashing markets?","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},"pub_date":1471669205,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit","title":"Brexit would prompt stock market and house price crash ...","snippet":"13 May 2016 — IMF issues stark warning that vote to leave EU would prompt panic among investors and send UK shares and property prices into a spin.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":13},"pub_date":1463159576,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/brexit-vote-leaves-uk-on-brink-of-recession-economists-say","title":"Brexit vote leaves UK on brink of recession, economists say","snippet":"24 Jun 2016 — The Treasury had forecast that a vote to leave the EU would knock national output and push the UK into recession.

It’s also the laziest excuse in modern politics: slide one step from “experts don’t know everything” into “experts don’t know anything,” then use that as permission to do whatever you already wanted to do.\n\nMichael Gove’s June 2016 soundbite is the canonical version. The line that went viral was “people in this country have had enough of experts,” but the fuller quote is narrower: “experts from organisations with acronyms saying that they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong.” citeturn0search0turn0search1turn0search5 It wasn’t a careful philosophy of knowledge, it was a rhetorical jailbreak. Suddenly, “an expert said it” became a punchline, and “I don’t need to understand this” started to sound like a principled stance.\n\nHere’s the “myth myth” part: the original claim is mostly about forecasting, but it gets stretched until it’s about expertise itself. Forecasting is a particular job, and in the public mind it gets treated as the whole job. So when a forecast misses, the conclusion becomes “experts are useless,” not “forecasts are hard.”\n\nThe Brexit campaign is a neat case study in how this goes wrong without anyone needing to be a cartoon villain. Before the referendum, the Treasury pushed the “immediate shock” story hard, including a recession scenario and big near-term hits. citeturn2search3 The economy didn’t tip into recession in the immediate aftermath, and that miss got memed into “Project Fear,” which then got recycled into a general “experts are always wrong” vibe. The Institute for Government’s later roundup of campaign claims is blunt about the narrow point: no immediate recession, even if other effects did show up. citeturn2search8\n\nBut if you zoom out a few years, the boring structural stuff is where the “experts” were pointing, and where the data and the later work has landed. By the mid-2020s, multiple pieces of analysis put the UK’s GDP per head materially below a plausible “no Brexit” counterfactual, in the rough ballpark of 6–8% lower by 2025. citeturn0search10turn0search7turn0search14turn0search15 The Office for Budget Responsibility has also talked in terms of a lasting productivity hit, often referenced as around 4% in the long run. citeturn0news44\n\nOn your “£250bn” vibe: it’s not insane as a headline, but the clean way to say it is “the economy is smaller than it would have been,” not “net worth.” UK cash GDP was about £2,891bn in 2024. citeturn1search1 If the level effect is 6–8%, that’s roughly £170–£230bn of output per year in 2024-ish money, depending on which estimate you pick and what you take as the baseline. citeturn0search10turn0search7turn0search14turn0search15 If you want to keep “£250bn” you can, but I’d write it as “order-of-magnitude” rather than a nailed-down figure, unless you’re going to pin it to a specific model and year.\n\nSo what’s the actual debunk?\n\nFirst: most expertise isn’t prediction. It’s explanation, diagnosis, measurement, and constraint. A decent engineer isn’t valuable because they can predict the exact date a bridge component will fail in 2041; they’re valuable because they can tell you which failure modes matter, which assumptions are fantasy, what the safety margins buy you, what your options cost, and what will break first if you cheap out. That’s not prophecy, it’s understanding.\n\nSecond: even when you *are* doing prediction, the useful part isn’t the point forecast. It’s the shape of uncertainty and the conditional logic. “If X stays true, Y gets more likely; if Z changes, all bets are off.” Economists know point forecasts are mostly theatre, which is why the serious work tends to live in scenarios, sensitivity, ranges, and “what would have to be true for this to happen.” The public debate strips all that out because it’s annoying and doesn’t fit in a headline, then mocks the headline when reality refuses to cooperate.\n\nThird, and this is one you already have: prediction failure is still information. How wrong you are isn’t just a scorecard for dunking on someone, it’s a signal about whether you’re in a stable, repetitive regime or whether something genuinely new is happening. When the error blows out, it often means your model’s assumptions just got invalidated. That matters. It’s literally one of the main reasons you bother modelling anything in the first place: not to be “right,” but to notice when you’re no longer even in the right neighbourhood.\n\nWhich leads to the simplest practical rule for the post: if you think “experts are bad at predictions,” fine. Stop demanding predictions. Stop rewarding certainty. Stop treating a forecast as a promise. Ask for the assumptions, the range, the base rate, the confidence, and what would change their mind. The anti-expert move isn’t scepticism; it’s skipping all of that and calling it freedom.\n\nThe thing that really annoys me about the “enough of experts” meme is that it pretends to be anti-elitist while quietly being anti-responsibility. If you reject expertise, what are you replacing it with? Vibes? A bloke on a podcast? Your own gut, which is just your prior beliefs wearing a fake moustache? The grown-up version of scepticism is demanding better experts, better incentives, and better ways of communicating uncertainty, not burning the whole concept down because a pundit oversold a short-term forecast on a breakfast sofa.\n\nIf you want a punchy ending for the post, it’s basically this: experts don’t know everything, obviously. But “experts don’t know anything” is how you end up proudly steering with your eyes closed, then getting mad at physics."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"citeturn0search0turn0search1turn0search5","start_idx":690,"end_idx":735,"safe_urls":["https://spectator.com/article/fact-check-what-did-michael-gove-actually-say-about-experts/","https://spectator.com/article/fact-check-what-did-michael-gove-actually-say-about-experts/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.london.edu/think/who-needs-experts","https://www.london.edu/think/who-needs-experts?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.weforum.org/stories/2016/07/people-in-this-country-have-had-enough-of-experts-why/","https://www.weforum.org/stories/2016/07/people-in-this-country-have-had-enough-of-experts-why/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([London Business School](https://www.london.edu/think/who-needs-experts?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"\"I think the people of this country have had enough of experts\"","url":"https://www.london.edu/think/who-needs-experts?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1494288000,"snippet":"Michael Gove touched a populist nerve.

Then it gets casually twisted even deeper into “experts don’t know anything,” and suddenly it’s a cudgel to act against reason. You can practically date-stamp the vibe shift to ratfink Gove landing his epic “Britain has had enough of experts” line, the gif what [sic] got shared like it was a mic drop instead of a self-own.\n\nAnd, look, I get the emotional appeal. If someone in a suit with an acronym says “this will happen” and it doesn’t, it feels good to laugh and move on. But that’s where the myth myth comes in: people take a real weakness in one narrow bit of expertise and use it to pretend expertise itself is fake.\n\nMy key point is embarrassingly simple. It only really applies to predictions, even if you squeeze the numbers. Most expert work isn’t prophecy. It’s measuring, diagnosing, explaining constraints, and telling you what follows *if* certain things are true. That’s not “knowing everything.” It’s just knowing more than you, in a specific domain, because they’ve done the reps and you haven’t. You don’t have to worship it. You also don’t get to hand-wave it away because a forecast missed.\n\nSo just don’t make predictions. Or at least, don’t treat predictions like promises. Economists know predictions are bullshit anyway; serious people talk in ranges, scenarios, “if this then that,” and they argue about assumptions because assumptions are where the bodies are buried. The public version strips all that out, demands a single number, then does the smug victory lap when reality refuses to behave.\n\nAlso: being wrong is still useful. How far off you are tells you something. Big misses can be a signal that you’re in novelty territory, not repetition territory. Errors aren’t just “lol gotcha,” they’re a way to detect that the world changed or your model got stale.\n\nEven the example most used to demonstrate the fail is a utility-style problem: demand forecasts, capacity planning, long time horizons, messy human behaviour. If you judge that work by “did they nail the exact number,” you’re basically choosing the dumbest yardstick on purpose. The point is whether they built something resilient to uncertainty, not whether they guessed the future like a wizard.\n\nAs for the “£250 billion from Britain’s net worth” vibe: I’d keep it as “order of magnitude” but tighten the claim. “Net worth” is slippery; the cleaner version is “hundreds of billions in lost output over time,” with the annual gap depending on the counterfactual you pick. The point isn’t the exact figure.

I dragged in the recession thing as a stock example of “experts said X,” and it derailed what you were actually talking about: the cost to the economy as a generalised representative figure, and the way that line got used as a permission slip. Bin it.\n\nAlso: if you’re talking about how 2016 felt on the ground, “there was no recession” is a nerdy macro label, not a rebuttal. You can have GDP wobbling around “fine” while whole sectors get their contracts nuked, hiring freezes roll in, clients stop spending, rates compress, and everyone you know quietly gets poorer. That *is* a recession in the only sense most people experience.\n\nHere’s the tighter version, under 500:\n\n“The expert myth” is everywhere now: the observation that experts suck at predictions (or perhaps “experts don’t know everything”, duh). Then it gets casually twisted even deeper into “experts don’t know anything” and used as a cudgel to act against reason. You can practically date-stamp the vibe shift to ratfink Gove landing his epic “Britain has had enough of experts” line, the gif what [sic] got shared like it was a mic drop instead of a self-own, and then somehow we all pretended that was grown-up politics.\n\nThe “expert myth myth” is simple: people take a real weakness in one narrow bit of expertise and use it to pretend expertise itself is fake. They don’t even do it carefully. They just slide from “bad at forecasts” to “can’t tell you anything” and call it common sense.\n\nMy key point is even more simple. It only really applies to predictions, even if you squeeze the numbers. Most expert work isn’t prophecy. It’s measurement, diagnosis, constraints, trade-offs, “if this then that.” It’s the boring bit where you narrow the space of bullshit. You don’t have to worship it. But “experts don’t know anything” is just licence to stop thinking.\n\nSo just don’t make predictions. Or at least don’t treat predictions like promises. Economists know predictions are bullshit anyway; the serious work is assumptions, ranges, scenarios, sensitivities. The public version strips that out, demands one clean number, then does the smug victory lap when reality doesn’t cooperate.\n\nAnd here’s where the lived experience matters. In 2016, me and almost every developer I know was “contract ended.” That wasn’t a vibes-only wobble, that was livelihoods getting chopped. You can tell me the official charts didn’t tick the right boxes and I’ll still tell you, honestly, this is the longest deepest recession of my life for those and literally every real person I know. If “the economy” is doing fine while your world is collapsing, maybe the experts aren’t lying, they’re just measuring the wrong thing for the question you’re actually asking.\n\nThe cost point stands either way. Call it hundreds of billions in lost output over time, pick your counterfactual, argue about the exact figure if you enjoy that kind of pain. The shape of the story doesn’t change: turning “experts aren’t oracles” into “experts are useless” is how you end up proudly flying blind, then acting surprised when you hit something solid."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":3093,"end_idx":3093,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-6876f53e923481919f351f03171c1acc","search_result_groups":[],"request_id":"7d431834-a070-4d9e-b498-01658118150c","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"7fbaf130-208b-440d-9b80-06e8dd52560b","turn_exchange_id":"1f40720e-491c-431a-9c28-b974f139a580","model_switcher_deny":[],"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"7fbaf130-208b-440d-9b80-06e8dd52560b","children":["4c7b4ad5-bfb5-4880-aa19-423cab3ca01a"]},"4c7b4ad5-bfb5-4880-aa19-423cab3ca01a":{"id":"4c7b4ad5-bfb5-4880-aa19-423cab3ca01a","message":{"id":"4c7b4ad5-bfb5-4880-aa19-423cab3ca01a","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770607937.703,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["stop changing what I fucking said.

You can feel how easy that slide is: a missed forecast becomes a personality flaw, then becomes a worldview, then becomes a permission slip. And it’s been turbocharged ever since ratfink Gove landed his epic “britain has had enough of experts” line, the gif what [sic] sunk about a £250 billion from Britain’s net worth (call it that kind of order-of-magnitude figure; I’m not pretending it’s a neat single-number invoice).\n\nSo: debunk the expert myth quite simply. One of my key points being even more simply, it only really applies to predictions, even if you squeeze the numbers. Expertise is mostly not prediction. It’s knowing what matters, what doesn’t, what’s constrained, what’s trade-offs, what breaks first, what’s already known, what’s unknowable, and what questions are secretly two questions pretending to be one. The myth only works if you pretend the whole job is standing on a hill and shouting the future.\n\nSo just don’t make predictions. Or at least stop treating predictions as the main product. Economists know predictions are bullshit anyway, but we still keep demanding them because they’re narratively satisfying: one number, one date, one confident face. The more interesting part is the scaffolding around the guess: assumptions, ranges, scenarios, sensitivity to inputs, and what would have to be true for the “confident” outcome to actually happen.\n\nAnd even if you insist on scoring predictions, it’s how far off you are that is still a useful tool to get an idea for your levels of say innovation vs repetition etc. Small errors can mean you’re in a stable, repetitive system. Big errors can mean the world changed, incentives shifted, a constraint snapped, or you’ve wandered into novelty territory. That isn’t “experts don’t know anything”; it’s literally the point of trying to model anything in the first place: to notice when you’re no longer in the same game.\n\nEven the example most used to demonstrate the fail is a utility.

net migration would shrink UK economy by 3.6%, says thinktank","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts that if net migration to the UK falls to zero, the economy would shrink by 3.6% by 2040. This scenario is based on recent trends showing reduced birthrates and a significant drop in net migration—from 649,000 to 204,000 in the year to June 2025—prompted by stricter visa policies. Without migration, the UK population would stabilize around 70 million by 2030, with aging demographics leading to slower employment growth and a smaller workforce.\n\nThough GDP per capita might rise by 2% due to increased productivity and automation, these gains would be offset by weaker overall economic growth. An aging population would reduce tax revenues, widen the gap between public spending and income, and cause the government to increase borrowing—raising the deficit by £37 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, by 2040. Without a rise in fertility or migration, sustaining public finances would likely require significant tax hikes, which could further hinder growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28},"pub_date":1770181233,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/07/brexit-farm-products-sales-eu","title":"Post-Brexit sales of British farm products to EU fall by 37%","snippet":"Since Brexit in 2020, British farm product exports to the EU have declined by 37.4%, according to National Farmers' Union (NFU) analysis of HMRC data. The poultry sector has suffered the most (down 37.7%), followed by declines in beef (23.6%), lamb (14%), and dairy (15.6%) exports. NFU president Tom Bradshaw attributes much of this decline to trade barriers post-Brexit and warns that simply reducing friction will not automatically restore market demand. He stresses that rebuilding trade with the EU will require sustained effort.\n\nThe article also discusses efforts to improve UK-EU political dialogue with fortnightly meetings ahead of a planned leaders' summit by mid-2026. Topics include agriculture and broader trade negotiations. The failed talks on UK participation in the EU's €150bn Safe defence program are cited as a missed diplomatic opportunity. Meanwhile, the NFU is urging for transitional exemptions and recognition of UK progress in areas like gene editing and vaccines to avoid disruptions in trade and innovation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1770465602,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/19/how-has-britain-economy-fared-since-brexit-the-five-charts-underpinning-the-uk-eu-summit","title":"How has Britain's economy fared since Brexit?

Justice Secretary David Lammy is reportedly behind the proposal, citing the need to address court backlogs, but No 10 insists that no final decisions have been made. The legal community, including the Law Society and former prosecutors, has condemned the idea as an extreme deviation from the principles of justice.\n\nSimultaneously, Labour’s budget plans were revealed, including a 4.1% rise in the minimum wage, restricted access to luxury cars in the Motability scheme, and the proposed expansion of the sugar tax to milk-based drinks. There’s an expected freeze on fuel duty and cuts to energy bill levies.\n\nElsewhere, a heated debate continues over trans healthcare, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch opposing NHS trials of puberty blockers, drawing criticism from Health Secretary Wes Streeting.\n\nAdditionally, the government announced support for Heathrow's third runway and empowered mayors to impose a tourist tax. Meanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer sparked discussion around UK support for Ukraine and Reform UK’s alleged ties to pro-Russian interests following a bribery conviction involving former MEP Nathan Gill.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1764095670,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.com/business/economics/article/cutting-net-migration-to-zero-will-hit-economy-and-raise-deficit-f3b7pqd7s","title":"Cutting net migration to zero 'will hit economy and raise deficit'","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research warns that cutting net migration to zero would be fiscally unsustainable for the UK. While it could lead to a short-term improvement in living standards—raising income per person by 2%—it would shrink the overall economy by 3.6% by 2040 and increase the deficit by £37 billion. The workforce would be 2.5 million smaller, reducing tax revenues and forcing the government to increase taxes or cut spending to maintain fiscal stability. This warning follows a sharp drop in net migration to 200,000 in 2025, the lowest since 2012. Recent reductions reflect stricter immigration policies implemented by both Conservative and Labour governments. The institute emphasizes that positive net migration offers a more sustainable path. Under zero net migration, the UK population would stabilize at 70 million by 2030, compared to 74 million with current projections. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to fall below the Bank of England’s 2% target, prompting likely interest rate cuts in 2026. The economy is forecast to grow by 1.4% in 2026, with slower growth in subsequent years partly due to tax changes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":29},"pub_date":1770163260,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/b14f7bc3-5536-4b2f-96a2-ea233644aebe","title":"Rushing Brexit reset deal risks costing British farmers, Keir Starmer told","snippet":"The British food and farming industry has cautioned Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government against rushing into a veterinary agreement with the EU to reduce trade barriers post-Brexit, warning that a hasty deal could lead to major costs.

Industry representatives estimate UK cereal farmers could suffer losses between £500 million and £810 million in the first year if alignment is immediate and uncompromising.\n\nThe National Farmers Union and biotech firms stressed the need for a transition period to avoid damaging production. Meanwhile, Brussels indicated openness to transitional arrangements but limited flexibility on carve-outs, warning against undermining the EU's regulatory framework. The UK Cabinet Office projects a long-term £5.1 billion annual economic boost from a deal, but industry leaders insist more dialogue and caution are needed.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1770249663.565,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/044c8e21-0160-4457-9de7-a9b17b1d7678","title":"The UK must do more than go on muddling through","snippet":"7 Dec 2025 — This concluded “that by 2025, Brexit had reduced UK GDP by 6 per cent to 8 per cent”.

The OBR is expected to lower its trend productivity growth forecast by 0.3 percentage points, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates would increase public borrowing by £21bn by 2029-30. This revision could expand the overall fiscal gap—previously estimated at £20bn–£30bn—posing a challenge for Reeves' fiscal rules and manifesto tax pledges.\n\nReeves attributed the productivity slump to the long-term effects of the financial crisis and Brexit, blaming the former Conservative government. The timing of the OBR's downgrade has caused frustration among Labour officials, who feel it should have been issued before the 2024 election. The Chancellor may now consider lifting income tax or extending freezes on personal tax thresholds to close the fiscal gap, with a 1p rise in the basic rate potentially generating over £8bn annually.\n\nAdditional pressures include cancelled welfare cuts and calls to remove the two-child benefit cap, costing more than £8.5bn.

net migration would shrink UK economy by 3.6%, says thinktank","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts that if net migration to the UK falls to zero, the economy would shrink by 3.6% by 2040. This scenario is based on recent trends showing reduced birthrates and a significant drop in net migration—from 649,000 to 204,000 in the year to June 2025—prompted by stricter visa policies. Without migration, the UK population would stabilize around 70 million by 2030, with aging demographics leading to slower employment growth and a smaller workforce.\n\nThough GDP per capita might rise by 2% due to increased productivity and automation, these gains would be offset by weaker overall economic growth. An aging population would reduce tax revenues, widen the gap between public spending and income, and cause the government to increase borrowing—raising the deficit by £37 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, by 2040. Without a rise in fertility or migration, sustaining public finances would likely require significant tax hikes, which could further hinder growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":30},"pub_date":1770181233,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/07/brexit-farm-products-sales-eu","title":"Post-Brexit sales of British farm products to EU fall by 37%","snippet":"Since Brexit in 2020, British farm product exports to the EU have declined by 37.4%, according to National Farmers' Union (NFU) analysis of HMRC data. The poultry sector has suffered the most (down 37.7%), followed by declines in beef (23.6%), lamb (14%), and dairy (15.6%) exports. NFU president Tom Bradshaw attributes much of this decline to trade barriers post-Brexit and warns that simply reducing friction will not automatically restore market demand. He stresses that rebuilding trade with the EU will require sustained effort.\n\nThe article also discusses efforts to improve UK-EU political dialogue with fortnightly meetings ahead of a planned leaders' summit by mid-2026. Topics include agriculture and broader trade negotiations. The failed talks on UK participation in the EU's €150bn Safe defence program are cited as a missed diplomatic opportunity. Meanwhile, the NFU is urging for transitional exemptions and recognition of UK progress in areas like gene editing and vaccines to avoid disruptions in trade and innovation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1770465602,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/nov/25/nigel-farage-nathan-gill-labour-reform-uk-russia-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-news","title":"UK politics: No 10 says no final decisions after leak reveals jury trials might be scrapped except for alleged rapists and killers - as it happened","snippet":"The UK government is facing backlash after a leaked proposal suggested scrapping jury trials for most criminal cases, retaining them only for serious offenses such as rape, murder, and manslaughter. Justice Secretary David Lammy is reportedly behind the proposal, citing the need to address court backlogs, but No 10 insists that no final decisions have been made. The legal community, including the Law Society and former prosecutors, has condemned the idea as an extreme deviation from the principles of justice.\n\nSimultaneously, Labour’s budget plans were revealed, including a 4.1% rise in the minimum wage, restricted access to luxury cars in the Motability scheme, and the proposed expansion of the sugar tax to milk-based drinks. There’s an expected freeze on fuel duty and cuts to energy bill levies.\n\nElsewhere, a heated debate continues over trans healthcare, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch opposing NHS trials of puberty blockers, drawing criticism from Health Secretary Wes Streeting.\n\nAdditionally, the government announced support for Heathrow's third runway and empowered mayors to impose a tourist tax. Meanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer sparked discussion around UK support for Ukraine and Reform UK’s alleged ties to pro-Russian interests following a bribery conviction involving former MEP Nathan Gill.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1764095670,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/bank-england-mpc-votes-5-4-keep-rates-hold-signals-reduction-ahead-2026-02-05/","title":"Bank of England votes narrowly to hold rates but signals reduction ahead","snippet":"On February 5, 2026, the Bank of England (BoE) voted narrowly (5-4) to keep interest rates steady at 3.75%, signaling a likely reduction in borrowing costs if inflation continues to fall. This decision came alongside a downgrade in its economic growth forecast for 2026 and an increased unemployment projection. The close vote contrasted with expectations of a 7-2 consensus, causing sterling to sharply decline and pushing bond yields lower.\n\nGovernor Andrew Bailey, one of the five who supported holding rates, acknowledged signs of easing inflation and indicated there could be more rate cuts this year, though he did not specify timing. A March cut is considered a 50% probability. Meanwhile, the BoE expects inflation to drop to its 2% target by April and suggested potential for it to fall below target later.\n\nThe four members who voted for a cut expressed concern over weakening inflation amid economic slowdown. The BoE is treading cautiously, balancing inflation control with economic recovery following Brexit, the pandemic, and energy price shocks. The bank maintained its forward guidance, reaffirming that further rate cuts are likely, dependent on inflation trends.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1770298975,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/bank-england-holds-rates-after-narrow-5-4-vote-signals-reduction-ahead-2026-02-05/","title":"Bank of England holds rates after narrow 5-4 vote, signals reduction ahead","snippet":"The Bank of England (BoE) has decided to hold its benchmark interest rate at 3.75% following a narrow 5-4 vote, signaling a possible rate reduction later in 2026 if upcoming inflation declines prove sustained. Despite forecasts showing slower UK economic growth and rising unemployment, the decision aligned with economist expectations but was less decisive than anticipated. Governor Andrew Bailey and other policymakers indicated openness to rate cuts if inflation, expected to hit the 2% target in April thanks to recent fiscal measures, remains low. The BoE has already cut rates four times in 2025. A major concern for some MPC members is avoiding excessively low inflation amid weak economic conditions. Inflation is forecast to dip to 1.7% before stabilizing, and wage growth is expected to gradually decelerate. The BoE trimmed its 2026 growth forecast to 0.9% and raised its peak unemployment outlook to 5.3%. While the central bank maintained a cautious stance, it suggested that closer votes on future rate cuts are likely depending on inflation trends. Bond yields rose ahead of the announcement, and political uncertainty surrounding the Prime Minister's ambassadorial appointment may have added to market unease.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1770292953,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/its-brexit-u-turn-or-bust-britains-flagging-economy-2025-12-17/","title":"It's Brexit U-turn or bust for Britain's flagging economy","snippet":"16 Dec 2025 — It calculated that Brexit has so far cut Britain's GDP by 6-8%, more than the OBR's assessment that post-Brexit trading arrangements would ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1765956292.01,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/london-mayor-says-brexit-has-cost-uk-over-178-bln-so-far-2024-01-11/","title":"London mayor says Brexit has cost UK over $178 billion so ...","snippet":"11 Jan 2024 — Britain's departure from the European Union has reduced the size of its economy by 6% so far - an annual cost of 140 billion pounds ($178 billion) - London ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1704968954.879,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/b14f7bc3-5536-4b2f-96a2-ea233644aebe","title":"Rushing Brexit reset deal risks costing British farmers, Keir Starmer told","snippet":"The British food and farming industry has cautioned Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government against rushing into a veterinary agreement with the EU to reduce trade barriers post-Brexit, warning that a hasty deal could lead to major costs. The government aims to secure an EU agreement that removes border checks on UK food and drink exports by mid-2027, a key part of its plan to reset relations with Brussels.\n\nHowever, the proposed requirement to \"dynamically align\" with EU sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) rules could prevent UK farmers from using pesticides and gene-editing technologies currently permitted in Britain but banned in the EU. Industry representatives estimate UK cereal farmers could suffer losses between £500 million and £810 million in the first year if alignment is immediate and uncompromising.\n\nThe National Farmers Union and biotech firms stressed the need for a transition period to avoid damaging production. Meanwhile, Brussels indicated openness to transitional arrangements but limited flexibility on carve-outs, warning against undermining the EU's regulatory framework. The UK Cabinet Office projects a long-term £5.1 billion annual economic boost from a deal, but industry leaders insist more dialogue and caution are needed.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1770249663.565,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/044c8e21-0160-4457-9de7-a9b17b1d7678","title":"The UK must do more than go on muddling through","snippet":"7 Dec 2025 — This concluded “that by 2025, Brexit had reduced UK GDP by 6 per cent to 8 per cent”.

net migration would shrink UK economy by 3.6%, says thinktank","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts that if net migration to the UK falls to zero, the economy would shrink by 3.6% by 2040. This scenario is based on recent trends showing reduced birthrates and a significant drop in net migration—from 649,000 to 204,000 in the year to June 2025—prompted by stricter visa policies. Without migration, the UK population would stabilize around 70 million by 2030, with aging demographics leading to slower employment growth and a smaller workforce.\n\nThough GDP per capita might rise by 2% due to increased productivity and automation, these gains would be offset by weaker overall economic growth. An aging population would reduce tax revenues, widen the gap between public spending and income, and cause the government to increase borrowing—raising the deficit by £37 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, by 2040. Without a rise in fertility or migration, sustaining public finances would likely require significant tax hikes, which could further hinder growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":23},"pub_date":1770181233,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/07/brexit-farm-products-sales-eu","title":"Post-Brexit sales of British farm products to EU fall by 37%","snippet":"Since Brexit in 2020, British farm product exports to the EU have declined by 37.4%, according to National Farmers' Union (NFU) analysis of HMRC data. The poultry sector has suffered the most (down 37.7%), followed by declines in beef (23.6%), lamb (14%), and dairy (15.6%) exports. NFU president Tom Bradshaw attributes much of this decline to trade barriers post-Brexit and warns that simply reducing friction will not automatically restore market demand. He stresses that rebuilding trade with the EU will require sustained effort.\n\nThe article also discusses efforts to improve UK-EU political dialogue with fortnightly meetings ahead of a planned leaders' summit by mid-2026. Topics include agriculture and broader trade negotiations. The failed talks on UK participation in the EU's €150bn Safe defence program are cited as a missed diplomatic opportunity. Meanwhile, the NFU is urging for transitional exemptions and recognition of UK progress in areas like gene editing and vaccines to avoid disruptions in trade and innovation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24},"pub_date":1770465602,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/nov/25/nigel-farage-nathan-gill-labour-reform-uk-russia-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-news","title":"UK politics: No 10 says no final decisions after leak reveals jury trials might be scrapped except for alleged rapists and killers - as it happened","snippet":"The UK government is facing backlash after a leaked proposal suggested scrapping jury trials for most criminal cases, retaining them only for serious offenses such as rape, murder, and manslaughter. Justice Secretary David Lammy is reportedly behind the proposal, citing the need to address court backlogs, but No 10 insists that no final decisions have been made. The legal community, including the Law Society and former prosecutors, has condemned the idea as an extreme deviation from the principles of justice.\n\nSimultaneously, Labour’s budget plans were revealed, including a 4.1% rise in the minimum wage, restricted access to luxury cars in the Motability scheme, and the proposed expansion of the sugar tax to milk-based drinks. There’s an expected freeze on fuel duty and cuts to energy bill levies.\n\nElsewhere, a heated debate continues over trans healthcare, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch opposing NHS trials of puberty blockers, drawing criticism from Health Secretary Wes Streeting.\n\nAdditionally, the government announced support for Heathrow's third runway and empowered mayors to impose a tourist tax. Meanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer sparked discussion around UK support for Ukraine and Reform UK’s alleged ties to pro-Russian interests following a bribery conviction involving former MEP Nathan Gill.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1764095670,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/b14f7bc3-5536-4b2f-96a2-ea233644aebe","title":"Rushing Brexit reset deal risks costing British farmers, Keir Starmer told","snippet":"The British food and farming industry has cautioned Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government against rushing into a veterinary agreement with the EU to reduce trade barriers post-Brexit, warning that a hasty deal could lead to major costs. The government aims to secure an EU agreement that removes border checks on UK food and drink exports by mid-2027, a key part of its plan to reset relations with Brussels.\n\nHowever, the proposed requirement to \"dynamically align\" with EU sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) rules could prevent UK farmers from using pesticides and gene-editing technologies currently permitted in Britain but banned in the EU. Industry representatives estimate UK cereal farmers could suffer losses between £500 million and £810 million in the first year if alignment is immediate and uncompromising.\n\nThe National Farmers Union and biotech firms stressed the need for a transition period to avoid damaging production. Meanwhile, Brussels indicated openness to transitional arrangements but limited flexibility on carve-outs, warning against undermining the EU's regulatory framework. The UK Cabinet Office projects a long-term £5.1 billion annual economic boost from a deal, but industry leaders insist more dialogue and caution are needed.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1770249663.565,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/044c8e21-0160-4457-9de7-a9b17b1d7678","title":"The UK must do more than go on muddling through","snippet":"7 Dec 2025 — This concluded “that by 2025, Brexit had reduced UK GDP by 6 per cent to 8 per cent”.

In its first review of UK trade policy post-Brexit, the WTO attributed the decline in trade performance largely to Brexit, alongside existing economic weaknesses since the 2008 financial crash. The WTO underscored the importance of trade for the UK economy and advised stronger efforts to revive it.\n\nDespite this, UK Trade Minister Sir Chris Bryant acknowledged cuts to export promotion staff within the Department for Business and Trade, citing a 20% staff reduction by 2029 as part of departmental efficiency measures. While aiming to ease EU-UK trade friction, Bryant confirmed the UK will not rejoin the EU single market or customs union. A proposed EU-UK veterinary agreement was mentioned as a potential small economic boost.\n\nThe government's own analysis estimates only a minor 0.3% GDP increase by 2030 from the EU trade “reset,” compared to a long-term 4% GDP loss due to Brexit. The WTO did highlight positive performance in high-tech sectors like aerospace and biotech, which have maintained competitive advantages.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":44},"pub_date":1761656435.096,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/its-brexit-u-turn-or-bust-britains-flagging-economy-2025-12-17/","title":"It's Brexit U-turn or bust for Britain's flagging economy","snippet":"16 Dec 2025 — It calculated that Brexit has so far cut Britain's GDP by 6-8%, more than the OBR's assessment that post-Brexit trading arrangements would ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1765956292.01,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bloomberg.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-21/brexit-hit-to-uk-economy-double-official-estimate-study-finds","title":"Brexit Hit to UK Economy Double Official Estimate, Study ...","snippet":"20 Nov 2025 — The effect of Brexit appears to be ongoing, with a GDP shortfall of 4–6% by 2021 but deeper, at 6-8%, in 2025.

In its latest forecast, the IMF downgraded the UK's GDP growth projection by 0.5 percentage points to 1.1% for the year—among the largest cuts for any major economy and equal to the reduction for China, which faces 145% US tariffs. The UK, being a small and trade-dependent nation, is particularly vulnerable to the ripple effects of global market uncertainty. Higher yields on UK government bonds (gilts), rising to over 4.5%, reflect low investor confidence and tighter financial conditions, which could raise borrowing costs. Domestically, the UK's economic weaknesses are compounded by low consumer confidence, high savings rates, and rising inflation—projected to exceed 3% due to increased utility bills. However, the IMF noted a potential silver lining: falling global goods prices from tariffs may lower inflation and permit the Bank of England to reduce interest rates up to three times, which could stimulate economic activity and ease pressure on the labor market.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1745340300,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_rebate","title":"UK rebate","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":49},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_the_United_Kingdom_to_CPTPP","title":"Accession of the United Kingdom to CPTPP","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":51},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-EU_leaflet","title":"Pro-EU leaflet","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":52},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_cost-of-living_crisis","title":"United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":53},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"arxiv.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00535","title":"Actualised and future changes in regional economic growth through sea level rise","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"academia","ref_index":50},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"arxiv.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20169","title":"United in Currency, Divided in Growth: Dynamic Effects of Euro Adoption","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"academia","ref_index":54},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"arxiv.org"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_6989569a03b8832aa17de5f86dc2c02e","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Title:\nEstimating the Economic Impact of Brexit on GDP","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"5792b489-5829-4f10-82e3-052106fce169","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"9980ae2b-5002-4a20-8071-fa535df385c0","turn_exchange_id":"68893f48-1cbc-477f-91f8-0af28df67e8d","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9980ae2b-5002-4a20-8071-fa535df385c0","children":["aeae59b1-65c9-4e4f-a600-c574e27a9e8c"]},"aeae59b1-65c9-4e4f-a600-c574e27a9e8c":{"id":"aeae59b1-65c9-4e4f-a600-c574e27a9e8c","message":{"id":"aeae59b1-65c9-4e4f-a600-c574e27a9e8c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770608374.244441,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Crafting response with headline figures and citations","content":"Here's one headline figure: If we look at GDP, the shortfall is about 6-8%, translating to roughly £173-231bn in 2024.

net migration would shrink UK economy by 3.6%, says thinktank","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts that if net migration to the UK falls to zero, the economy would shrink by 3.6% by 2040. This scenario is based on recent trends showing reduced birthrates and a significant drop in net migration—from 649,000 to 204,000 in the year to June 2025—prompted by stricter visa policies. Without migration, the UK population would stabilize around 70 million by 2030, with aging demographics leading to slower employment growth and a smaller workforce.\n\nThough GDP per capita might rise by 2% due to increased productivity and automation, these gains would be offset by weaker overall economic growth. An aging population would reduce tax revenues, widen the gap between public spending and income, and cause the government to increase borrowing—raising the deficit by £37 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, by 2040. Without a rise in fertility or migration, sustaining public finances would likely require significant tax hikes, which could further hinder growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1770181233,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/07/brexit-farm-products-sales-eu","title":"Post-Brexit sales of British farm products to EU fall by 37%","snippet":"Since Brexit in 2020, British farm product exports to the EU have declined by 37.4%, according to National Farmers' Union (NFU) analysis of HMRC data. The poultry sector has suffered the most (down 37.7%), followed by declines in beef (23.6%), lamb (14%), and dairy (15.6%) exports. NFU president Tom Bradshaw attributes much of this decline to trade barriers post-Brexit and warns that simply reducing friction will not automatically restore market demand. He stresses that rebuilding trade with the EU will require sustained effort.\n\nThe article also discusses efforts to improve UK-EU political dialogue with fortnightly meetings ahead of a planned leaders' summit by mid-2026. Topics include agriculture and broader trade negotiations. The failed talks on UK participation in the EU's €150bn Safe defence program are cited as a missed diplomatic opportunity. Meanwhile, the NFU is urging for transitional exemptions and recognition of UK progress in areas like gene editing and vaccines to avoid disruptions in trade and innovation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1770465602,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/08/brexit-failed-uk-eu","title":"Britain is stuck with a failed Brexit that neither citizens nor ...","snippet":"8 Dec 2025 — Yet in recent weeks, a major study has found that leaving the EU cost the UK 6-8% of GDP per capita; now the chancellor calls the damage of ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":1765180846,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/22/britain-economy-brexit-damage-customs-union","title":"Britain's economy has been damaged by Brexit.

Justice Secretary David Lammy is reportedly behind the proposal, citing the need to address court backlogs, but No 10 insists that no final decisions have been made. The legal community, including the Law Society and former prosecutors, has condemned the idea as an extreme deviation from the principles of justice.\n\nSimultaneously, Labour’s budget plans were revealed, including a 4.1% rise in the minimum wage, restricted access to luxury cars in the Motability scheme, and the proposed expansion of the sugar tax to milk-based drinks. There’s an expected freeze on fuel duty and cuts to energy bill levies.\n\nElsewhere, a heated debate continues over trans healthcare, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch opposing NHS trials of puberty blockers, drawing criticism from Health Secretary Wes Streeting.\n\nAdditionally, the government announced support for Heathrow's third runway and empowered mayors to impose a tourist tax. Meanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer sparked discussion around UK support for Ukraine and Reform UK’s alleged ties to pro-Russian interests following a bribery conviction involving former MEP Nathan Gill.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":45},"pub_date":1764095670,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.com/business/economics/article/cutting-net-migration-to-zero-will-hit-economy-and-raise-deficit-f3b7pqd7s","title":"Cutting net migration to zero 'will hit economy and raise deficit'","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research warns that cutting net migration to zero would be fiscally unsustainable for the UK. While it could lead to a short-term improvement in living standards—raising income per person by 2%—it would shrink the overall economy by 3.6% by 2040 and increase the deficit by £37 billion. The workforce would be 2.5 million smaller, reducing tax revenues and forcing the government to increase taxes or cut spending to maintain fiscal stability. This warning follows a sharp drop in net migration to 200,000 in 2025, the lowest since 2012. Recent reductions reflect stricter immigration policies implemented by both Conservative and Labour governments. The institute emphasizes that positive net migration offers a more sustainable path. Under zero net migration, the UK population would stabilize at 70 million by 2030, compared to 74 million with current projections. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to fall below the Bank of England’s 2% target, prompting likely interest rate cuts in 2026. The economy is forecast to grow by 1.4% in 2026, with slower growth in subsequent years partly due to tax changes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":32},"pub_date":1770163260,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-manufacturing-pmi-rises-highest-since-august-2024-2026-02-02/","title":"UK manufacturing PMI rises to highest since August 2024","snippet":"In January 2026, the UK manufacturing sector showed signs of renewed strength, with the S&P Global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rising to 51.8—its highest level since August 2024. This improvement was driven by a notable rise in new orders, especially export orders, which recorded their first growth in four years. Demand from Europe, the U.S., China, and emerging markets contributed to the increase. Business confidence also surged to its highest level since before the Autumn 2024 budget.\n\nDespite this growth, challenges persist. Employment in manufacturing continued to decline, although at a slower pace than after the October 2024 increase in employment taxes under Finance Minister Rachel Reeves. Input costs rose sharply due to higher prices for raw materials, energy, and labor. Political and fiscal policy shifts caused initial uncertainty, but sentiment has improved amid delayed tax rises and expectations of stronger economic performance than the government’s projected 1.4% growth rate for 2026.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1770024977,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/uk-unemployment-set-hit-11-year-high-2026-niesr-forecasts-2026-02-04/","title":"UK unemployment set to hit 11-year high in 2026, NIESR forecasts","snippet":"The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has forecast that UK unemployment will rise to 5.4% in 2026, marking the highest rate since 2015. Key contributors include rising labour costs driven by increases in the national minimum wage—which now represents two-thirds of median earnings—and a hike in employers’ social security contributions, which together led to a 10.6% rise in the cost of hiring entry-level workers in 2025. Industries heavily reliant on minimum wage workers, as well as the IT sector, have seen notable rises in unemployment, with the latter impacted by automation and artificial intelligence. Although job vacancies have not significantly declined, more people re-entering the workforce post-pandemic are contributing to higher unemployment figures. The minimum wage is set to increase by another 4% in April, and the government plans to eliminate lower-tier wages for younger workers. NIESR forecasts the unemployment rate will ease to 5% by 2028 or 2029, assuming no recession. Despite the labour market challenges, NIESR has modestly raised its 2026 and 2027 growth projections and expects two Bank of England rate cuts this year, bringing the benchmark rate to 3.25%.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1770163688,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.nber.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34459","title":"The Economic Impact of Brexit","snippet":"by N Bloom · 2025 · Cited by 5 — Issue Date November 2025.

That’s the headline from the big 2025 Decision Maker Panel / macro synthesis work (Bloom et al.), and it’s echoed in the UK in a Changing Europe summary of the same estimates. citeturn4search12turn4search17turn3search0\n\nTranslate that into a rough £ number and you get the kind of figure you can drop into a blog post without pretending it’s an invoice. UK cash GDP in 2024 was **£2,891bn**. citeturn2search0  \nSo **6–8%** of that is about **£170–£230bn a year** in “missing output” terms, in today-ish money. citeturn2search0turn4search12  \n(That’s “running rate” logic: the economy is smaller *each year* than it would otherwise have been, not “one-off loss”.)\n\nIf you want the more official, more conservative benchmark to triangulate against, the OBR’s long-standing rule-of-thumb is that post-Brexit trade intensity implies around a **4% hit to potential productivity** in the long run (their forecasts also assume imports/exports volumes 15% lower than a remain counterfactual). citeturn0search5turn0search21  \nOn that same 2024 GDP, 4% is ~£116bn/year, but it’s a “fully baked over time” kind of number, not “cash found down the back of the sofa”. citeturn2search0turn0search5\n\nYour rough-era framing basically matches how the better studies describe it:\n\n2016–2018: “paper movements” is not a bad vibe-summary.

The better attempts don’t “subtract covid”, they compare the UK to peer-country paths (synthetic-control / relative performance) so the common covid shock mostly cancels out, imperfectly. Bloomberg’s write-up of the 2025 work describes the shortfall as **4–6% by 2021**, deepening to **6–8% by 2025**, which is basically “slow-burn drag that kept dragging through covid”. citeturn4search2turn4search12\n\n2021–2025: the trade-friction era is where the structural stuff is meant to show up.

Based on customs data from over 100,000 firms, UK exports fell 6.4% and imports dropped 3.1% by the end of 2022. Small businesses were hit hardest, with more than 14,000 halting EU trade altogether, while larger firms largely maintained their trade levels.\n\nThe study suggests that while the impact of Brexit has been significant—especially for small exporters—it is less severe than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had forecast. The OBR previously predicted a 15% drop in trade and a 4% reduction in national income over the long term. The TCA introduced non-tariff trade barriers such as customs checks and regulatory paperwork, which disproportionately affected smaller firms. However, some importers mitigated impacts by sourcing goods outside the EU. \n\nThe report concludes that UK trade has shown moderate short-term resilience, though long-term outcomes will depend on future trade negotiations and firms' ability to adapt.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1734524552,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/nov/25/nigel-farage-nathan-gill-labour-reform-uk-russia-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-news","title":"UK politics: No 10 says no final decisions after leak reveals jury trials might be scrapped except for alleged rapists and killers - as it happened","snippet":"The UK government is facing backlash after a leaked proposal suggested scrapping jury trials for most criminal cases, retaining them only for serious offenses such as rape, murder, and manslaughter. Justice Secretary David Lammy is reportedly behind the proposal, citing the need to address court backlogs, but No 10 insists that no final decisions have been made. The legal community, including the Law Society and former prosecutors, has condemned the idea as an extreme deviation from the principles of justice.\n\nSimultaneously, Labour’s budget plans were revealed, including a 4.1% rise in the minimum wage, restricted access to luxury cars in the Motability scheme, and the proposed expansion of the sugar tax to milk-based drinks. There’s an expected freeze on fuel duty and cuts to energy bill levies.\n\nElsewhere, a heated debate continues over trans healthcare, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch opposing NHS trials of puberty blockers, drawing criticism from Health Secretary Wes Streeting.\n\nAdditionally, the government announced support for Heathrow's third runway and empowered mayors to impose a tourist tax. Meanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer sparked discussion around UK support for Ukraine and Reform UK’s alleged ties to pro-Russian interests following a bribery conviction involving former MEP Nathan Gill.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1764095670,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-reeves-says-brexit-austerity-hit-harder-than-thought-2025-10-21/","title":"UK's Reeves says Brexit and austerity hit harder than thought","snippet":"UK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves acknowledged that Brexit and austerity measures imposed by prior governments have had a more significant negative impact on the British economy than initially projected. Speaking at a conference in Birmingham and quoted by The Guardian, Reeves emphasized that these factors, including cuts to capital spending, have been especially detrimental to economic growth. She stated her commitment to improving the UK's relationship with the European Union in an effort to mitigate costs imposed on businesses since the 2016 Brexit referendum and the UK's formal departure from the EU.\n\nReeves is preparing a new budget expected to feature tax increases alongside initiatives aimed at stimulating growth, even as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is predicted to downgrade the country's economic growth forecasts. The OBR has estimated that Brexit alone will lower the UK’s long-term productivity by 4% compared to if the country had remained in the EU. Additionally, with public borrowing for the first half of the financial year reaching historic highs—second only to the coronavirus pandemic—Reeves faces mounting fiscal challenges ahead of the November 26 budget announcement. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey also recently noted that Brexit will likely continue to impede growth in the coming years.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1761052747,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69895849dda8832abf376815224313fe","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Browsing recent research on Brexit economic impact","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"42d6e1e6-8e30-4375-9146-bb8708f0204b","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"8071ca84-aedb-4427-beea-4e11d748cfd5","turn_exchange_id":"128f9168-cf6e-470d-aa3c-1322255c0427","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8071ca84-aedb-4427-beea-4e11d748cfd5","children":["3e93ca7e-b308-4718-99e4-65f86cab177d"]},"3e93ca7e-b308-4718-99e4-65f86cab177d":{"id":"3e93ca7e-b308-4718-99e4-65f86cab177d","message":{"id":"3e93ca7e-b308-4718-99e4-65f86cab177d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770608719.187374,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Nuancing the cumulative gap calculation","content":"I need to clarify that the annual gap in 2024-2025 is significant but the cumulative gap isn’t 10x.

Justice Secretary David Lammy is reportedly behind the proposal, citing the need to address court backlogs, but No 10 insists that no final decisions have been made. The legal community, including the Law Society and former prosecutors, has condemned the idea as an extreme deviation from the principles of justice.\n\nSimultaneously, Labour’s budget plans were revealed, including a 4.1% rise in the minimum wage, restricted access to luxury cars in the Motability scheme, and the proposed expansion of the sugar tax to milk-based drinks. There’s an expected freeze on fuel duty and cuts to energy bill levies.\n\nElsewhere, a heated debate continues over trans healthcare, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch opposing NHS trials of puberty blockers, drawing criticism from Health Secretary Wes Streeting.\n\nAdditionally, the government announced support for Heathrow's third runway and empowered mayors to impose a tourist tax. Meanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer sparked discussion around UK support for Ukraine and Reform UK’s alleged ties to pro-Russian interests following a bribery conviction involving former MEP Nathan Gill.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1764095670,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/22/britain-economy-brexit-damage-customs-union","title":"Britain's economy has been damaged by Brexit. But what should ministers do about it?","snippet":"Nearly 10 years after the Brexit vote, its economic toll on Britain is evident. Though initial fears of a \"doomsday\" scenario didn't materialize, the UK's trade, investment, and living standards have all declined due to political instability and trade barriers introduced post-2020. Exports, particularly of goods, declined sharply, and the UK underperforms compared to other G7 nations. While services have rebounded slightly, key industries like financial services have lost ground, especially in EU markets.\n\nThe debate now centers on how to respond. Some in Labour suggest deeper EU trade ties, possibly through a customs union, though party leadership rejects rejoining the single market or customs union due to issues like freedom of movement. Labour proposes sector-specific agreements to ease trade frictions instead, though their expected economic boost is limited (around 0.3% of GDP by 2040).\n\nA broader customs union could boost the UK economy more significantly—by up to 2.2%, according to some estimates—but would require complex negotiations and might restrict the UK’s independent trade policy. While closer EU alignment could revive growth, any new arrangement would demand major political compromises and lengthy negotiations.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1766414376,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-must-be-bold-reforms-after-policy-u-turns-think-tank-says-2026-01-19/","title":"UK must be bold on reforms after policy U-turns, think tank says","snippet":"A report by the Resolution Foundation urges the UK government to adopt bold reforms in trade, housing, and employment to leverage early signs of economic recovery. Since Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s election 18 months ago, the government has been criticized for frequent policy reversals and lack of decisive action, particularly in areas like welfare and tax reform. The think tank emphasizes that boosting productivity—with recent growth of 3.1% reported—could significantly raise household incomes by £2,000 annually and support a 25% increase in public health service spending. Recommended reforms include easing planning regulations to meet urban housing needs, strengthening regulatory alignment with the EU, and improving workforce participation across age groups. The report also notes that while productivity may be improving, long-term stagnation and setbacks from COVID-19, high energy costs, and Brexit continue to hinder the economy, with Brexit's impact potentially being double the 4% previously estimated.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1768781792,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69895adba57c832690ffabb129dcaa1e","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Browsing for UK GDP projections, Brexit impact, and evidence","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"85bccbd5-7e1b-4fe3-a42b-2a6a4c06d2cf","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"abcaa9f9-120e-4a5d-8305-420bf2c88ab6","turn_exchange_id":"b6049f8f-73d5-4be0-90bf-8db2b00d81e3","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"abcaa9f9-120e-4a5d-8305-420bf2c88ab6","children":["5a34ad41-5bcd-4116-acbd-114f67a7d1e1"]},"5a34ad41-5bcd-4116-acbd-114f67a7d1e1":{"id":"5a34ad41-5bcd-4116-acbd-114f67a7d1e1","message":{"id":"5a34ad41-5bcd-4116-acbd-114f67a7d1e1","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770609375.898277,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Creating evidence pack and projecting GDP shortfall","content":"My plan is to craft a structured but not overly formal evidence pack.

to cut climate finance to poor countries by a fifth despite promising more help","snippet":"The UK government plans to cut its international climate finance for developing countries from £11.6 billion to £9 billion over the next five years—an effective 40% decrease in real terms due to inflation. This move follows promises from the UK and other wealthy nations to triple global climate finance by 2035, a goal now harder to meet with such cuts. Critics, including climate campaigners and think tanks, warn that the reduction could harm vulnerable populations, undermine global climate action, and damage the UK's international reputation. The decision, influenced by Treasury constraints, comes amid internal government disputes and a shift in priorities within the Foreign Office.\n\nConcerns are heightened by attempts to reclassify non-climate projects, like health and education, as climate finance, risking transparency and credibility. Key nature conservation programs face funding reductions, despite intelligence reports linking environmental collapse to UK national security risks. Experts argue that scaling back climate aid jeopardizes food security and geopolitical stability. The government defends the cut as part of a modernization effort to maximize impact, stating it remains committed to its £11.6 billion target for the current financial year. However, campaigners emphasize that reducing support now sends a dangerous message to the global community.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22},"pub_date":1770310842,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/apr/22/us-dollar-yen-pound-gold-stock-markets-trump-attack-powell-imf-growth-forecast-business-live","title":"IMF slashes global growth forecast to 2.8% this year due to Trump trade war - as it happened","snippet":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sharply downgraded global economic growth forecasts in its latest World Economic Outlook due to the economic fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive trade tariffs. Global GDP growth for 2025 is now projected at 2.8%, down from 3.3% just three months prior. The U.S., a key driver of the slowdown, saw its forecast slashed from 2.7% to 1.8%, while the UK was downgraded from 1.6% to 1.1%, though it remains the fastest-growing European G7 country. The IMF cited increased tariff-related uncertainty and deteriorating global financial stability, warning of rising risks of a U.S. recession and inflation.\n\nMarkets responded with a slump in U.S. asset values, a plunging dollar (hitting a three-year low), and surging gold, which reached a record $3,500 per ounce. The IMF also highlighted investor concerns over the Federal Reserve’s independence following Trump’s criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Financial stability risks have increased, with tightening global conditions and volatility in equity and bond markets threatening further disruption. The IMF urged constructive international cooperation on trade and debt restructuring to mitigate ongoing economic turmoil.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1745336631,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ons.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp","title":"Gross Domestic Product (GDP)","snippet":"GDP at current prices – real-time database (YBHA).

The UK’s GDP is expected to grow from under $4 trillion in 2025 to $6.8 trillion by 2040. This shift will be partly due to weaker growth in France and Germany, with Germany maintaining the fourth position and Japan falling to sixth. Meanwhile, India is set to become the world’s third-largest economy, ascending from ninth place in 2010 and is on track to be the largest by the century’s end.\n\nThe US and China will remain the two largest economies, though China is expected to narrow the gap and eventually overtake the US by 2045 based on current price GDP. Emerging economies like Indonesia are also expected to rise significantly in global rankings due to strong investment and young populations.\n\nDespite GDP growth, the UK's living standards are projected to decline relative to other economies, dropping from 19th to 21st in global GDP per capita rankings by 2040. The report warns of global challenges including high US tariffs, inflation, debt, and geopolitical tensions, which are expected to slow overall economic growth to 2.5% next year.","ref_id":{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1766707260,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69895adba57c832690ffabb129dcaa1e","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for UK nominal GDP data 2016-2024","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"85bccbd5-7e1b-4fe3-a42b-2a6a4c06d2cf","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"d704e546-c8cf-4382-8bad-baaa44dbb0c2","turn_exchange_id":"b6049f8f-73d5-4be0-90bf-8db2b00d81e3","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d704e546-c8cf-4382-8bad-baaa44dbb0c2","children":["4319e65b-0991-4e41-9f7b-04f7d4a81bcc"]},"4319e65b-0991-4e41-9f7b-04f7d4a81bcc":{"id":"4319e65b-0991-4e41-9f7b-04f7d4a81bcc","message":{"id":"4319e65b-0991-4e41-9f7b-04f7d4a81bcc","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770609424.763256,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Estimating missing output using GDP series","content":"We have annual nominal GDP data from ONS for 2016-2024.

of England votes narrowly to hold rates but signals reduction ahead","snippet":"On February 5, 2026, the Bank of England (BoE) voted narrowly (5-4) to keep interest rates steady at 3.75%, signaling a likely reduction in borrowing costs if inflation continues to fall. This decision came alongside a downgrade in its economic growth forecast for 2026 and an increased unemployment projection. The close vote contrasted with expectations of a 7-2 consensus, causing sterling to sharply decline and pushing bond yields lower.\n\nGovernor Andrew Bailey, one of the five who supported holding rates, acknowledged signs of easing inflation and indicated there could be more rate cuts this year, though he did not specify timing. A March cut is considered a 50% probability. Meanwhile, the BoE expects inflation to drop to its 2% target by April and suggested potential for it to fall below target later.\n\nThe four members who voted for a cut expressed concern over weakening inflation amid economic slowdown. The BoE is treading cautiously, balancing inflation control with economic recovery following Brexit, the pandemic, and energy price shocks. The bank maintained its forward guidance, reaffirming that further rate cuts are likely, dependent on inflation trends.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1770298975,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.bankofengland.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2017/ten-months-after-the-eu-referendum-how-is-the-economy-doing.pdf","title":"Ten months after the EU Referendum: How is the economy ...","snippet":"by K Forbes · 2017 — The BoE judged that this depreciation would lift inflation above target in 2017-19, eroding consumers' real incomes and spending.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1492772648,"attribution":"www.bankofengland.co.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/inflation-report/2016/november-2016.pdf","title":"Inflation Report - November 2016","snippet":"2 Nov 2016 — In the first, the sterling exchange rate stabilised for a period following its initial post-referendum depreciation.

The consultancy attributed the slowdown to a sharp decline in consumer spending (down from 1.9% to 1.2%) and a steeper drop in business investment (from 3.4% to 0.8%). The report highlighted how rising inflation outpaced wage growth, limiting real income gains for workers. Despite labor shortages, firms faced profit margin pressures and hesitated to raise wages significantly amid economic uncertainty.\n\nKPMG projected that if Brexit negotiations failed, the Bank of England might cut interest rates to 0.25% and introduce additional support for the banking sector. Conversely, a smooth Brexit process could see gradual rate increases to 1% by late 2019. The consultancy also expected housing market growth to slow, particularly in London, where prices could fall by 0.7% in 2019, while Scotland might see 4.9% price growth. Overall, the report painted a picture of a subdued economic outlook weighed down by uncertainty and weak productivity.","ref_id":{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1536561597,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/22/brexit-vote-cost-uk-mark-carney-bank-of-england","title":"Brexit vote has cost each UK household £900, says Mark Carney","snippet":"Bank of England Governor Mark Carney stated that UK households are more than £900 worse off as a result of the Brexit vote, citing a significant shortfall in household income growth compared to pre-referendum forecasts. Addressing MPs, Carney attributed much of the gap to the 2016 decision to leave the EU, noting the economy is now 2% smaller than expected. Despite global economic strength and an emergency rate cut following the vote, corporate investment and productivity have lagged. Carney’s remarks provoked strong reactions: Brexit supporters like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson dismissed his concerns, while opponents, including Lib Dem leader Vince Cable and trade unions, emphasized the real financial strain on citizens. Carney acknowledged the drop in the pound and subsequent inflation as major contributors to reduced living standards, which had only recently started recovering.

net migration would shrink UK economy by 3.6%, says thinktank","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts that if net migration to the UK falls to zero, the economy would shrink by 3.6% by 2040. This scenario is based on recent trends showing reduced birthrates and a significant drop in net migration—from 649,000 to 204,000 in the year to June 2025—prompted by stricter visa policies. Without migration, the UK population would stabilize around 70 million by 2030, with aging demographics leading to slower employment growth and a smaller workforce.\n\nThough GDP per capita might rise by 2% due to increased productivity and automation, these gains would be offset by weaker overall economic growth. An aging population would reduce tax revenues, widen the gap between public spending and income, and cause the government to increase borrowing—raising the deficit by £37 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, by 2040. Without a rise in fertility or migration, sustaining public finances would likely require significant tax hikes, which could further hinder growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":25},"pub_date":1770181233,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"obr.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2025/","title":"Economic and fiscal outlook – November 2025","snippet":"Chart D: Revisions to nominal GDP composition in the second quarter of 2025 ...

Key measures include holding firm on fiscal rules, with the Stability Rule and Investment Rule both being met two years early, and reducing national debt while avoiding tax increases.\n\nNotable announcements include:\n\n- A crackdown on tax evasion, raising £7.5bn annually.\n- Welfare reforms estimated to save £4.8bn, along with an investment of £1bn in personalized employment support.\n- An expansion of defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with an immediate £2.2bn increase, and a focus on turning the UK into a defence industrial superpower.\n- Efficiency reforms across government, including a £3.25bn Transformation Fund and plans to reduce Civil Service size and modernize public services using AI.\n- Increased capital spending to £100bn+ to boost infrastructure and economic growth.\n- Reforms to the planning system projected by the OBR to generate an additional £15.1bn in GDP over a decade and support housebuilding at a 40-year high.\n\nThe OBR revised GDP growth forecasts upward from 2026 onward and stated that real household income is expected to rise by £500 per household, signaling improving living standards. The Chancellor concluded by asserting his government is proactively addressing global challenges with long-term plans for economic resilience and improved public services.","ref_id":{"turn_index":6,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1743004548.456,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69895adba57c832690ffabb129dcaa1e","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for OBR November 2025 nominal GDP forecasts","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"85bccbd5-7e1b-4fe3-a42b-2a6a4c06d2cf","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"8aa9be24-444f-40ec-929b-3564f5ea7a8d","turn_exchange_id":"b6049f8f-73d5-4be0-90bf-8db2b00d81e3","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8aa9be24-444f-40ec-929b-3564f5ea7a8d","children":["406cfce2-a87d-4c59-907c-6f52ae92978f"]},"406cfce2-a87d-4c59-907c-6f52ae92978f":{"id":"406cfce2-a87d-4c59-907c-6f52ae92978f","message":{"id":"406cfce2-a87d-4c59-907c-6f52ae92978f","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770609475.70783,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Using OBR data for GDP projection and missing output","content":"The OBR forecast shows nominal GDP growth for 2025 at 4.9%.

net migration would shrink UK economy by 3.6%, says thinktank","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts that if net migration to the UK falls to zero, the economy would shrink by 3.6% by 2040. This scenario is based on recent trends showing reduced birthrates and a significant drop in net migration—from 649,000 to 204,000 in the year to June 2025—prompted by stricter visa policies. Without migration, the UK population would stabilize around 70 million by 2030, with aging demographics leading to slower employment growth and a smaller workforce.\n\nThough GDP per capita might rise by 2% due to increased productivity and automation, these gains would be offset by weaker overall economic growth. An aging population would reduce tax revenues, widen the gap between public spending and income, and cause the government to increase borrowing—raising the deficit by £37 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, by 2040. Without a rise in fertility or migration, sustaining public finances would likely require significant tax hikes, which could further hinder growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":31},"pub_date":1770181233,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/nov/26/budget-2025-rachel-reeves-tax-cash-isa-minimum-wage-latest-news-updates","title":"Budget 2025: Reeves claims freezing tax thresholds in budget does not breach manifesto pledge - as it happened","snippet":"Chancellor Rachel Reeves presented the 2025 UK Budget with a focus on addressing the cost of living crisis, stabilizing public finances, and promoting economic growth, while aiming to adhere to Labour’s manifesto promises. Key measures included abolishing the two-child benefit cap to alleviate child poverty, cuts to household energy bills, freezing fuel duty, and extending the freeze on income tax thresholds to raise an estimated £26bn. Reeves defended the tax threshold freeze, asserting it didn't breach Labour’s tax pledges, describing it as a needed contribution from working people.\n\nThe budget received a mixed reaction. Critics, including opposition party leaders and some Labour MPs, argued it involved stealth tax increases and insufficient action on wealth taxes. The Liberal Democrats and Greens questioned its fairness, especially towards lower-income households. The digital services tax and potential relief for high-value property owners faced scrutiny.\n\nMarkets reacted calmly, with UK gilts showing their best performance on a budget day since 2006. However, a serious technical mishap by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which released its report early, sparked political controversy, with calls for investigation and potential resignations. Reeves emphasized long-term investments in infrastructure and reinforced Labour’s commitment to fiscal responsibility and economic renewal.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1764181297,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"obr.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2025/","title":"Economic and fiscal outlook – November 2025","snippet":"In 2024, the UK government deficit was 5.7 per cent of GDP – the fourth ...

This follows a £40bn increase last year and adds a further £26bn, targeting workers, businesses, and the wealthy. Tax hikes include freezing income tax thresholds, reforms to pension salary sacrifices, and new levies on property and dividends, including a new mansion tax. While spending rises immediately—with the removal of the two-child benefit cap and increased welfare outlays—most tax revenues are deferred, prompting the Institute for Fiscal Studies to label the approach \"spend now, pay later.\"\n\nOfficial forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) indicate lower growth, squeezed household incomes, and persistent inflation, although the Budget was welcomed by bond markets for expanding fiscal headroom to £21.7bn by 2029-30. Labour MPs supported the tax increases on wealthier groups, but critics argue the measures hit ordinary workers too. The Budget announcement was marred by a premature OBR leak and controversies around broken pledges not to raise taxes again. Additional tax measures include levies on electric cars, gambling, and luxury homes. Reeves defends the move as necessary and aligned with Labour's manifesto.","ref_id":{"turn_index":11,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1764160438.593,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69895adba57c832690ffabb129dcaa1e","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching UK tax burden and budget data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"85bccbd5-7e1b-4fe3-a42b-2a6a4c06d2cf","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"5a63eae5-594e-486d-8ea4-6eccb2d88114","turn_exchange_id":"b6049f8f-73d5-4be0-90bf-8db2b00d81e3","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5a63eae5-594e-486d-8ea4-6eccb2d88114","children":["74f2a67c-4202-44a2-9713-e2ab1f136bbe"]},"74f2a67c-4202-44a2-9713-e2ab1f136bbe":{"id":"74f2a67c-4202-44a2-9713-e2ab1f136bbe","message":{"id":"74f2a67c-4202-44a2-9713-e2ab1f136bbe","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770609596.608234,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Using Parliament tax data for analysis","content":"I’ll use the Parliament tax statistics PDF (CBP-8513), which shows receipts at 39.4% of GDP in 2024/25.

The poultry sector has suffered the most (down 37.7%), followed by declines in beef (23.6%), lamb (14%), and dairy (15.6%) exports.

Topics include agriculture and broader trade negotiations. The failed talks on UK participation in the EU's €150bn Safe defence program are cited as a missed diplomatic opportunity.

Speaking at a Birmingham investment summit, she highlighted that Brexit has inflicted more economic damage than initially forecast, with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expected to sharply downgrade growth and productivity forecasts. Reeves signaled looming tax hikes and spending cuts to address a government budget shortfall potentially reaching £40bn. \n\nReeves emphasized renewed EU relations, slashing regulations, and protected infrastructure investment as growth drivers. She refuted austerity and committed to preserving capital spending through reformulated fiscal rules. With inflation expected to rise and borrowing costs surging, Reeves is pushing a government-wide initiative to combat inflation—especially targeting energy costs.\n\nAdditionally, she proposes a £2bn tax increase targeting limited liability partnership workers, like lawyers and accountants, by adjusting their national insurance contributions. Reeves warned that unbalanced fiscal policy could trigger market instability, citing the 2022 mini-budget fallout.

This political scandal has fueled concerns about Starmer’s future, with markets worried about potential changes to fiscal policy if leadership shifts within the Labour Party. Ten-year gilt yields rose to 4.605%, and 30-year yields climbed to 5.406%, reflecting uncertainty over the government’s borrowing stance. The leadership turmoil is dominating headlines, with criticism from opposition parties and expectations rising that Starmer may be replaced, possibly by Angela Rayner, who is seen as favoring looser fiscal policy. The Eurasia Group raised the chance of a leadership challenge to 80%. The British pound fell 0.7% against the dollar, making it the weakest major currency of the day. Meanwhile, interest rate expectations remained steady, with the Bank of England likely to hold rates at 3.75% following multiple cuts in 2025.","ref_id":{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":24},"pub_date":1770283719,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/its-brexit-u-turn-or-bust-britains-flagging-economy-2025-12-17/","title":"It's Brexit U-turn or bust for Britain's flagging economy","snippet":"16 Dec 2025 — It calculated that Brexit has so far cut Britain's GDP by 6-8%, more than the OBR's assessment that post-Brexit trading arrangements would ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":13,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":1765956292.01,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-reeves-says-brexit-austerity-hit-harder-than-thought-2025-10-21/","title":"UK's Reeves says Brexit and austerity hit harder than thought","snippet":"UK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves acknowledged that Brexit and austerity measures imposed by prior governments have had a more significant negative impact on the British economy than initially projected.

Additionally, with public borrowing for the first half of the financial year reaching historic highs—second only to the coronavirus pandemic—Reeves faces mounting fiscal challenges ahead of the November 26 budget announcement.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves attributed the worsened public finances to underestimated impacts of Brexit, austerity, and capital spending cuts. She emphasized efforts to rebuild relations with the EU to minimize economic damage. Former OBR chief Sir Robert Chote warned unpalatable spending cuts may be required to prevent a fiscal crisis, highlighting concerns about the UK's 95.3% debt-to-GDP ratio and over £100 billion in annual debt interest. A think tank report he endorsed recommended significant and politically sensitive cuts to pensions, welfare, and the NHS. September alone saw £20.2 billion borrowed, the highest for that month since 2020. With shrinking fiscal room, ministers may be forced to consider raising major taxes—income tax, VAT, and national insurance—despite prior pledges.

That’s not my vibe, that’s the finding from Bloom/Bunn/Mizen/Smietanka/Thwaites using macro counterfactuals plus the Bank of England’s Decision Maker Panel microdata. [By 2025, we estimate UK GDP per capita was 6–8% lower than without Brexit](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexits-impact-on-the-uk-economy/). citeturn13search2turn13search7\n\nTranslate that into “what’s the tab”: UK GDP in 2024 was about **£2.89 trillion** in cash terms. [In cash terms, GDP was £2,891 billion in 2024](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn02783/). citeturn15view1  \nSo **6–8% of that is ~£170–£230 billion per year**. Which means your old “£250bn total bill” instinct wasn’t “too high”, it was basically **one year of the gap** at today’s scale.\n\nThe cumulative “since 2016” bill (the bit people argue about)\n\nHere’s a simple, transparent ramp that matches the usual shape people describe (“hard to see in 2017–18, then it accumulates”): tiny early hit, bigger post-2020 hit, and by 2024 you’re in the mid-single digits. The GDP numbers are straight from ONS current-price GDP. [ONS annual nominal GDP (current prices, £m)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/bktl/pn2). citeturn4search4\n\nAssumed gap is **not** claimed as “the true history”; it’s just a bridge between the published waypoints (4–6-ish by the early 2020s, 6–8 by 2025) and the reality that covid makes everything look like static.\n\n| Year | GDP £bn (current prices) | Assumed gap | Missing output £bn |\n|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| 2016 | 2004.8 | 0.0% | 0.0 |\n| 2017 | 2097.2 | 0.5% | 10.5 |\n| 2018 | 2171.6 | 1.0% | 21.7 |\n| 2019 | 2253.0 | 2.0% | 45.1 |\n| 2020 | 2124.7 | 3.5% | 74.4 |\n| 2021 | 2322.7 | 5.0% | 116.1 |\n| 2022 | 2580.9 | 5.5% | 142.0 |\n| 2023 | 2752.2 | 6.0% | 165.1 |\n| 2024 | 2883.9 | 6.5% | 187.5 |\n\nThat gives a **midpoint cumulative “missing output” of ~£762bn by end-2024**, with a reasonable “don’t pretend this is exact” range of about **£600bn to £920bn** depending how aggressively you ramp the early years. The underlying GDP series is ONS current-price GDP. citeturn4search4\n\nNow add 2025 and you’re basically at the “trillion” doorstep. If the gap is 6–8% and GDP is ~£3tn-ish in 2025, that’s another ~£180–£240bn for the year, putting you around **~£0.95–£1.0tn by end-2025**, and **over £1tn sometime in 2026** if nothing structurally changes.\n\nIf you want a more “official” pace, OBR’s standing assumption is milder: imports/exports volumes 15% lower, feeding into a 4% productivity hit, phased in over ~15 years. [OBR’s Brexit assumption: 15% lower trade volumes; 4% lower potential productivity; full effect after 15 years](https://obr.uk/box/how-are-our-brexit-trade-forecast-assumptions-performing/). citeturn15view0  \nUnder that kind of ramp, you don’t hit £1tn until the **early 2030s**. That’s the gap between “best recent estimate” and “official assumption”, and it’s basically the argument in one line.\n\nSo where is the money, actually\n\nSome of it is just deadweight. The “tab” isn’t a pile of banknotes in Brussels. It shows up as:\n\nA real-income hit (the pound drop, then prices)\nSterling got smashed after the vote, and that flows straight through to import prices and then living standards. A Bank of England MPC member put it bluntly in 2017: sterling fell ~16–17% since late-2015 (with ~two-thirds after the referendum) and the BoE judged that this would lift inflation and **erode consumers’ real incomes and spending**. citeturn7view0  \nIf you want a household-level number to hang it on, CEPR’s work on the Brexit-depreciation pass-through estimated prices **~2.9% higher by June 2018**, about **£870 per year** for the average household. [Brexit depreciation increased consumer prices by 2.9% (≈ £870/year per household)](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/brexit-vote-and-inflation-updated-evidence). citeturn5search8\n\nAn investment hole (less kit, less growth, less future pay)\nThe same 2025 study estimates **investment 12–18% lower** than the no-Brexit baseline. [Investment was 12–18% lower by 2025](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexits-impact-on-the-uk-economy/). citeturn13search2turn13search7  \nThat’s not “the vibes are bad”, that’s the boring compounding engine of lower productivity and weaker wages.\n\nTrade friction (paperwork as a permanent tax)\nOBR’s own trade box is unusually readable on this: they’ve been assuming lower trade volumes and a productivity hit for years, and they note UK trade intensity hasn’t recovered like other G7s post-pandemic; plus an ONS survey where **around half of exporters and two-thirds of importers reported extra costs** since the transition ended. citeturn15view0  \nThat’s the rot: a chunk of normal economic activity turns into compliance overhead, waiting time, duplicated certification, rerouting, warehousing, intermediaries.\n\nManagement time and misallocation (the “nothing gets built” tax)\nBloom et al explicitly list channels like **diverted management time** and **resource misallocation** as mechanisms, alongside trade/investment/migration. citeturn13search7  \nThis is the part everyone recognises in real life: the work didn’t disappear, it just got less productive and more annoying, and then you do less of the good stuff.\n\nThe covid masker problem\nYou’re right that covid makes it harder to pin the blame cleanly. The NBER paper basically acknowledges this in how they handle the macro series: they smooth through the worst of the covid shock by interpolating between pre-covid and post-covid estimates. citeturn1view0  \nSo anyone claiming “we’ll never know for sure” isn’t *wrong*, but that’s also exactly why the right move is to look at relative comparisons and micro data, not just a single UK time series.\n\n“How much of that would have been in the Treasury / our bank balances”\nIf you want a crude fiscal translation: public sector current receipts are about **39% of GDP** right now. citeturn12view0  \nSo a **£170–£230bn/year** GDP gap implies something like **£65–£90bn/year** of missing receipts in very rough terms (it won’t map 1:1, but it’s the right order of magnitude). That’s the bit that should have been NHS money, council money, “maybe we can fix the roads” money, and instead it’s just… not there.\n\nIf you want a single line you can lift without overselling it\n“On the best recent estimates, Brexit is a permanent ~£200bn-a-year drag on the UK economy now, and the cumulative bill since 2016 is already somewhere around the £600–£900bn range. If that drag persists, the ‘trillion’ headline isn’t a prediction, it’s just arithmetic, and it lands around 2025–26.”\n\nnavlistRecent readable coverageturn0news42,turn0news41"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"citeturn13search2turn13search7","start_idx":528,"end_idx":562,"safe_urls":["https://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexits-impact-on-the-uk-economy/","https://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexits-impact-on-the-uk-economy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w34459/w34459.pdf","https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w34459/w34459.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([UK in a Changing Europe](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexits-impact-on-the-uk-economy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Brexit's impact on the UK economy","url":"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexits-impact-on-the-uk-economy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"4 Dec 2025 — By 2025, we estimate that UK GDP per capita was 6–8% lower than it would have been without Brexit.

The ruling came in a judicial review brought by the Good Law Project and EveryDoctor, which challenged the process that bypassed standard procurement regulations. Justice O’Farrell found that the VIP lane breached the obligation of equal treatment under public contract regulations, calling the system flawed and lacking justifiable grounds for prioritization.\n\nCompanies like PestFix and Ayanda benefited from VIP lane access, though the judge acknowledged their contracts likely would have been awarded regardless due to high volumes of urgently needed PPE. However, some PPE from PestFix and Ayanda failed safety standards and was not used in the NHS, leading to ongoing disputes. The court emphasized that VIP lane referrals, including political or personal connections, gave suppliers faster access and attention.\n\nThe Department of Health claimed all offers underwent necessary checks, and a spokesperson for former health secretary Matt Hancock stated officials acted quickly to procure PPE in an emergency. Critics argue the system unjustly favored companies with political links during a public health crisis.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1641991704,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/11/food-insecurity-rising-uk-climate-breakdown-inflation-brexit-defra-report","title":"Food insecurity rising in UK because of climate breakdown, Defra report finds","snippet":"A recent UK government report from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) highlights a concerning rise in food insecurity across the UK, driven largely by climate change, inflation, and Brexit-related disruptions. Between 2019-20 and 2022-23, the proportion of \"highly food secure\" households declined from 87% to 83%, with vulnerable groups—such as low-income, young, and disabled individuals—disproportionately affected. Notably, only 79% of households led by people aged 16–24 were classified as food secure.\n\nThe report emphasizes that rising food and general inflation, combined with supply chain issues and increased import dependence—especially from climate-affected regions—are elevating the cost of food production. Brexit has also aggravated the situation, through labour shortages and reduced EU food imports. Farmers protested in Westminster, voicing concerns over inheritance tax changes and subsidy cuts impacting farm viability and national food security.\n\nMeanwhile, food price inflation in the UK has reached its highest level in 45 years, surpassing other G7 nations. Defra warns that persistent geopolitical tensions and climate instability continue to drive up production costs and hinder supply chain stability, putting further pressure on the UK's food resilience.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1733922290,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/62147390-2945-4e85-aa66-66db757814d7","title":"HMRC probes Tim Horlick's Ayanda Capital over pandemic-era taxes","snippet":"Ayanda Capital, a private investment firm that secured a £255 million contract to supply PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic, is under investigation by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) over potential tax underpayments related to its pandemic earnings. The firm, led by Tim Horlick and previously focused on private equity and currency trading, was awarded the contract via the UK's controversial \"VIP lane\" for suppliers with government connections. One of its board advisers, Andrew Mills, was also an unpaid adviser to the UK's Board of Trade at the time.\n\nAyanda came under scrutiny after the UK government purchased around 50 million masks from the firm that were later deemed unusable for failing safety requirements. The High Court ruled in 2022 that the VIP procurement process was unlawful, although it found that Ayanda would likely have received priority consideration regardless of the VIP lane due to the volume of PPE it could supply. Ayanda stated that its government contract had already undergone extensive legal scrutiny, with all claims against it being dismissed.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government is also pursuing the recovery of £148 million from PPE Medpro, another pandemic-era supplier, after it was found to have provided substandard gowns. PPE Medpro, linked to former Conservative peer Michelle Mone, is now in administration with significant tax liabilities.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1762725679.409,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69895d9b7f608331916874d5a95b0b39","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Analyzing Brexit's Economic Impact and Inequality","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"6d2a8150-3953-4989-9550-fe4fe89d01f8","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"25a60fa3-d51a-4ed7-af45-5190d6c84e6a","turn_exchange_id":"e82a9750-b172-41f7-bbbd-68d46b48a36a","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"25a60fa3-d51a-4ed7-af45-5190d6c84e6a","children":["e0a6020f-2d1a-4b86-8329-0f5f6defc2a3"]},"e0a6020f-2d1a-4b86-8329-0f5f6defc2a3":{"id":"e0a6020f-2d1a-4b86-8329-0f5f6defc2a3","message":{"id":"e0a6020f-2d1a-4b86-8329-0f5f6defc2a3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770610084.435981,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Addressing value distribution and user preferences for inline links","content":"I have enough sources to answer the question on distributional outcomes, sectors, regions, and political rent-seeking.

The company became involved through the government's controversial VIP lane, designed for politically connected suppliers. The contracts included £573 million for freight and £304 million for supplying PPE, though £178.5 million worth of PPE later ended up on a \"do not supply\" list.\n\nA High Court judgment in a case against PPE Medpro, which supplied unusable gowns, also highlighted Uniserve’s role in shipping the garments without proper inspection. The judge ruled this failure significantly contributed to the £122 million loss. Although Uniserve's founder, Iain Liddell, denied the obligation for early inspections, legal and political questions persist regarding oversight.\n\nUniserve came to government attention via a past connection between a DHSC official and a company executive, amplified by political contacts including Conservative peer Lord Agnew and MP Julia Lopez, whose office was based on Uniserve’s premises. Liddell acknowledged emailing Lopez about PPE delays. The controversy has reignited debates over political influence, procurement transparency, and financial oversight during the pandemic.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1762623602,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/26/brexit-export-licences-eu-food-agricultural-products-uk-companies","title":"Post-Brexit licences for exporting food to EU cost UK firms up to £65m last year","snippet":"In 2024, UK firms spent between £37 million and £65 million on 328,727 licences to export food and agricultural products to the EU, a result of post-Brexit trade barriers. Each licence cost between £113 and £200. The UK government, under Labour, is pledging to eliminate these costs by 2027 through a new trade deal with the EU, part of a broader policy to reduce non-tariff measures which have particularly hampered small businesses. Cabinet Office Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds is set to emphasize the economic rationale for closer EU alignment at a political event, criticizing rivals like Nigel Farage for advocating positions that he argues would harm the economy and increase food prices. Labour aims to reduce border checks and end export licences while avoiding the reintroduction of a customs union or free movement.

The new Border Target Operating Model is being introduced in three phases: the first, requiring extra certification, began on January 31; the second, involving physical port checks, started April 30; and the third, mandating safety and security declarations, is planned for October 31, 2024.\n\nThe NAO criticized the delays—five since the end of the Brexit transition in December 2020—which have led to unnecessary expenditures on unused infrastructure and personnel, increased uncertainty for businesses, higher biosecurity risks, and administrative burdens for UK-EU trade. It also highlighted weaknesses in the government's 2025 UK Border Strategy, citing a lack of an integrated delivery plan and the need for a more realistic digital transformation approach. While current border operations have been relatively smooth, the ongoing adjustments continue to impose costs and uncertainties.","ref_id":{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1716159901,"attribution":"www.reuters.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69895d9b7f608331916874d5a95b0b39","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for post-Brexit customs intermediary industry data","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"6d2a8150-3953-4989-9550-fe4fe89d01f8","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"extended","parent_id":"5b08298f-635d-4c4d-8943-c350d0c34fb2","turn_exchange_id":"e82a9750-b172-41f7-bbbd-68d46b48a36a","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5b08298f-635d-4c4d-8943-c350d0c34fb2","children":["12bdafdf-0076-4a88-b74f-ee9c10ef6777"]},"12bdafdf-0076-4a88-b74f-ee9c10ef6777":{"id":"12bdafdf-0076-4a88-b74f-ee9c10ef6777","message":{"id":"12bdafdf-0076-4a88-b74f-ee9c10ef6777","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770610108.272029,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Getting sources for regional inequality and consumption patterns","content":"I have some useful information on customs declaration costs and UK border spending, which helps.

If you only talk about “lost value”, you miss the nastier story: a lot of what Brexit did wasn’t just make the pot smaller, it made the pot **leakier**, and then created a whole set of ways to **charge rent on the leak**.\n\nStart with the most basic redistribution: the referendum shock helped drive a big sterling drop, and the *mechanical* effect of that is higher import costs and higher prices. The Bank of England and IFS were talking about pass-through straight away, with the Bank estimating a big chunk of a fall in sterling shows up in consumer prices. [“60% of a fall in sterling is passed through into higher prices… in the longer run… all of an increase in import costs”](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/fall-sterling-who-hit-rise-inflation). citeturn1view1  \nAnd there’s solid work pinning that inflation jump to the vote shock: [“the referendum shock led to an increase in aggregate UK inflation by 1.7 percentage points within one year”](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/sampsont/VoteInflation_TP.pdf). citeturn2view1turn4view2\n\nThe distributional twist is interesting. That same work finds [“inflation varies little across income deciles… costs… evenly shared throughout the income distribution”](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/sampsont/VoteInflation_TP.pdf) but **not** evenly across place: [London least affected; Scotland/Wales/Northern Ireland worst; “the north… harder hit than the south”](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/sampsont/VoteInflation_TP.pdf), with NI the extreme case in their table. citeturn4view1turn4view0  \nEven if the percentage hit is “even”, it still isn’t *felt* evenly: if you’re skint you don’t have slack, you just stop doing things.\n\nThen there’s the redistribution via *fixed costs*. Post-Brexit trade doesn’t just get smaller, it gets more admin-heavy. Government’s own estimate puts it bluntly: [“estimated average cost of a declaration, in 2022, is £48”](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/estimating-the-customs-administrative-burden-of-2022-declarations/estimating-the-administrative-burden-of-2022-import-and-export-customs-declarations-for-trade-between-great-britain-and-the-european-union-executive). citeturn5view0  \nThat’s not “lost GDP” in the abstract; it’s money and time that used to go into product, wages, or prices, now going into forms, agents, software, freight forwarders, warehouse dwell time, and the sheer faff of proving things. Big firms can amortise it; small exporters eat it or quit. And you can literally see the “new middleman economy” being propped up: [Trader Support Service had 47,000 users](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-into-intermediating-trade-with-northern-ireland-2022/qualitative-research-with-customs-intermediaries-to-better-understand-the-northern-ireland-intermediary-market-2022) because declarations became a legal requirement for GB→NI movements. citeturn5view1\n\nOn the public side, the state also started spending serious money just to make borders function. [NAO/Reuters: “at least 4.7 billion pounds” on post-Brexit border arrangements](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-post-brexit-border-arrangements-cost-6-bln-2024-05-19/). citeturn5view3  \nThat’s not “EU took our money”; it’s us paying ourselves (and contractors) to rebuild friction we chose to add.\n\nNow the darker redistribution: access and influence. You mentioned covid contracts, and while covid isn’t Brexit, the pattern of “fast lanes, low scrutiny, mates rates” is exactly the kind of thing that thrives when politics is running on permanent exception and permanent ideological churn. We don’t have to argue about vibes: the paperwork is there. NAO documents the [VIP / “High-Priority Lane”… 115 contracts worth £3.8bn… 46 didn’t go through the eight-stage due diligence process because they were awarded before May 2020](https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Investigation-into-the-management-of-PPE-contracts.pdf). citeturn1view3  \nTransparency International summarises the High Court outcome as [“the VIP lane was unlawful… conferred preferential treatment… approach… flawed”](https://www.transparency.org.uk/news/court-rules-ppe-vip-lane-unlawful-public-procurement-must-be-examined-covid-19-inquiry). citeturn2view5  \nAnd Parliament’s own Public Accounts Committee notes the scale and the waste: [nearly 10,000 PPE contracts worth £13.1bn; 1.0bn items deemed wastage; £7m/month storage costs; disputes over £3.9bn of contracts](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmpubacc/260/report.html). citeturn5view4  \nThat’s value moving from “taxpayer capacity” into a small set of firms, some competent, some not, with a chunk simply burned.\n\nFinally, the “soft opportunities” point. Brexit was repeatedly sold as a chance to rewrite rules to favour “growth” over “burdens”, and that’s a direct invitation for well-lawyered incumbents to push the line of least resistance. The data regime is a clean example because it’s explicit in the texts. Government’s post-Brexit data consultation response includes a proposal to [require the ICO to account for impacts on “growth, innovation and competition”](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/data-a-new-direction/outcome/data-a-new-direction-government-response-to-consultation). citeturn7view0  \nAnd the Commons Library briefing on the DPDI Bill quotes ministers framing it as [“seize the post-Brexit opportunity… reduce burdens… boost the economy by £4.7bn over the next decade”](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-9746/CBP-9746.pdf). citeturn7view1  \nYou can argue about merits, but the mechanism is clear: “less friction for business” is also “more room for lobbying, more room for risk, more room for the consequences to land on people who don’t have a compliance team.”\n\nIf you want to write this as “real economy” movement, it’s basically: consumers paid a currency/inflation tax; SMEs paid a fixed-cost compliance tax; regions outside London got hit harder on that first inflation spike; the state paid to rebuild borders; and a bunch of the new spend and new friction turned into rents for intermediaries, contractors, and the politically-connected. That’s the rot: smaller pot, leakier pot, and the leak has beneficiaries.\n\nnavlistRecent reporting worth

net migration would shrink UK economy by 3.6%, says thinktank","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts that if net migration to the UK falls to zero, the economy would shrink by 3.6% by 2040. This scenario is based on recent trends showing reduced birthrates and a significant drop in net migration—from 649,000 to 204,000 in the year to June 2025—prompted by stricter visa policies. Without migration, the UK population would stabilize around 70 million by 2030, with aging demographics leading to slower employment growth and a smaller workforce.\n\nThough GDP per capita might rise by 2% due to increased productivity and automation, these gains would be offset by weaker overall economic growth. An aging population would reduce tax revenues, widen the gap between public spending and income, and cause the government to increase borrowing—raising the deficit by £37 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, by 2040. Without a rise in fertility or migration, sustaining public finances would likely require significant tax hikes, which could further hinder growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":34},"pub_date":1770181233,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.com/business/economics/article/cutting-net-migration-to-zero-will-hit-economy-and-raise-deficit-f3b7pqd7s","title":"Cutting net migration to zero 'will hit economy and raise deficit'","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research warns that cutting net migration to zero would be fiscally unsustainable for the UK. While it could lead to a short-term improvement in living standards—raising income per person by 2%—it would shrink the overall economy by 3.6% by 2040 and increase the deficit by £37 billion. The workforce would be 2.5 million smaller, reducing tax revenues and forcing the government to increase taxes or cut spending to maintain fiscal stability. This warning follows a sharp drop in net migration to 200,000 in 2025, the lowest since 2012. Recent reductions reflect stricter immigration policies implemented by both Conservative and Labour governments. The institute emphasizes that positive net migration offers a more sustainable path. Under zero net migration, the UK population would stabilize at 70 million by 2030, compared to 74 million with current projections. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to fall below the Bank of England’s 2% target, prompting likely interest rate cuts in 2026. The economy is forecast to grow by 1.4% in 2026, with slower growth in subsequent years partly due to tax changes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1770163260,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/migrants-partners-visa-lifetime-cost-britain-dvv9ltq7r","title":"Migrant partners cost Britain £5.6 billion over their lifetime","snippet":"A report by the UK's Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) found that migrant partners who come to the UK under family visas cost the British economy £5.6 billion over their lifetimes. In 2022–23, 51,000 migrants entered as partners, with over half unemployed initially. Over a lifetime, each is projected to incur a net fiscal cost of £109,000, due in part to lower earnings and tax contributions compared to British residents. While initially economically positive, costs increase over time due to NHS use and benefits eligibility after gaining indefinite leave to remain. Only the top 10% of earners among them are likely to be net contributors.\n\nThe report also noted that migrants on family visas tend to remain in the UK, with employment rates stabilizing around 65% within five years, much higher among men. The cost analysis did not include contributions from their children. Changes to salary thresholds and English proficiency requirements for migrant partners are under consideration, after a pause in previously planned Conservative reforms. The MAC also recommended against raising salary thresholds for skilled workers above £41,700 and called for dropping rules that prioritize average job salaries over actual earnings. It further urged better protections for domestic workers vulnerable to exploitation.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1765990227,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"committees.parliament.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/83/home-affairs-committee/news/206734/national-audit-office-report-reveals-asylum-accommodation-cost-home-affairs-select-committee-to-question-accommodation-providers/","title":"National Audit Office report reveals asylum accommodation ...","snippet":"8 May 2025 — The National Audit Office (NAO) has published a report requested by the Home Affairs Committee into asylum accommodation contracts.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"committees.parliament.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-fiscal-impact-of-immigration-in-the-uk/","title":"The Fiscal Impact of Immigration in the UK","snippet":"25 Oct 2024 — The fiscal impact of immigration is estimated by calculating the contributions migrants make to public finances (such as through paying tax) ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/asylum-accommodation-in-the-uk/","title":"Asylum accommodation in the UK - Migration Observatory","snippet":"15 Aug 2025 — Regions housing a growing share of asylum seekers are also those with higher reliance on hotel accommodation.

receives £130m in tax breaks for making Bridgerton in UK","snippet":"Netflix has received nearly £130 million in UK government tax breaks for producing four seasons of its period drama \"Bridgerton\" in the country. By the end of 2024, the streaming giant had spent £509 million on the series, with the tax relief reducing its net expense to £381 million over seven years. The series, based on Julia Quinn's novels and narrated by Julie Andrews, is set during the Regency era and explores the romantic entanglements of the Bridgerton family. Filming locations included historic sites such as Halton House, Hampton Court Palace, and a large backlot at Shepperton Studios.\n\nThe UK's high-end TV tax relief, introduced in 2013, provides a 25% rebate for qualifying productions to retain big-budget projects domestically. This incentive has been credited with boosting the UK economy and creating thousands of skilled jobs. \"Bridgerton\" alone has supported 5,000 UK businesses and contributed over £275 million to the UK economy. The fourth series, released recently, garnered 40 million views in just four days and cost at least £86 million. Netflix has committed to two additional seasons as the show's popularity and economic impact continue to grow.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1770586814,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.com/money/tax/article/pension-tax-relief-unclaimed-higher-rate-taxpayers-lcp-dtfk2rz5z","title":"Why high earners are missing out on £1.4bn in pensions tax relief","snippet":"More than 800,000 high earners are missing out on about £1.4 billion in pension tax relief annually, according to data obtained by pensions consultancy LCP from HM Revenue & Customs. The underclaimed relief stems from savers, especially those newly entering higher tax brackets, failing to file tax returns to reclaim additional pension tax relief. While basic-rate taxpayers automatically receive 20% relief through the \"relief at source\" method, higher-rate (40%) and additional-rate (45%) earners must file a self-assessment tax return to claim the extra relief.\n\nA significant number of eligible taxpayers do not claim this relief—only 28% of estimated higher-rate and 88% of additional-rate taxpayers filed claims. Consequently, the average reclaim is £1,756 for higher-rate and £2,195 for additional-rate taxpayers. Experts warned that the actual unclaimed amount is likely even higher, as high earners are presumed to contribute more to pensions on average. The government’s freeze on income tax thresholds through 2031 could increase the number of people eligible for tax relief. Pension contributions via salary sacrifice automatically grant full relief, but most savers using relief at source must actively claim the extra tax relief through self-assessment.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1770012000,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/04/zero-net-migration-shrink-uk-economy-thinktank-niesr","title":"Zero net migration would shrink UK economy by 3.6%, says thinktank","snippet":"A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts that if net migration to the UK falls to zero, the economy would shrink by 3.6% by 2040. This scenario is based on recent trends showing reduced birthrates and a significant drop in net migration—from 649,000 to 204,000 in the year to June 2025—prompted by stricter visa policies. Without migration, the UK population would stabilize around 70 million by 2030, with aging demographics leading to slower employment growth and a smaller workforce.\n\nThough GDP per capita might rise by 2% due to increased productivity and automation, these gains would be offset by weaker overall economic growth. An aging population would reduce tax revenues, widen the gap between public spending and income, and cause the government to increase borrowing—raising the deficit by £37 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, by 2040. Without a rise in fertility or migration, sustaining public finances would likely require significant tax hikes, which could further hinder growth.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1770181233,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/18/private-landlords-in-england-get-16bn-a-year-welfare-for-non-decent-homes","title":"Private landlords in England get £1.6bn a year welfare for ' ...","snippet":"18 Apr 2023 — Private landlords in England are earning £1.6bn a year in housing benefit in return for providing “non-decent” homes, in what Sadiq Khan has described as a ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},"pub_date":1681858824,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ons.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/october2025","title":"Public sector finances, UK: October 2025","snippet":"21 Nov 2025 — In October 2025, the public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income.

Despite its growing scale, Britain has struggled to confront this crimewave effectively. Fewer than 10% of cases are investigated, and only 8.9% of those lead to justice. The former reporting system, Action Fraud, faced criticism for its ineffectiveness, especially after a 2019 investigation revealed systemic dismissal of victims. In response, the City of London police launched Report Fraud in December 2025 to improve reporting and investigations using AI, although skepticism remains about its efficacy.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has announced broader structural reforms, including a new National Police Service (dubbed the “British FBI”) to centralize efforts against complex crimes. Although refunds for victims of authorised push payment scams are improving, experts argue that merely reimbursing losses does not address the root of the problem. With scams evolving to evade countermeasures and often originating abroad, enforcement struggles to keep up. Experts propose shifting focus to prevention, better data collection, and holding digital platforms accountable. Critics fear that without significant investment in trained personnel and coordinated international efforts, the UK may continue failing to curb this pervasive criminal threat.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1770034529,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.com/money/tax/article/pension-tax-relief-unclaimed-higher-rate-taxpayers-lcp-dtfk2rz5z","title":"Why high earners are missing out on £1.4bn in pensions tax relief","snippet":"More than 800,000 high earners are missing out on about £1.4 billion in pension tax relief annually, according to data obtained by pensions consultancy LCP from HM Revenue & Customs. The underclaimed relief stems from savers, especially those newly entering higher tax brackets, failing to file tax returns to reclaim additional pension tax relief. While basic-rate taxpayers automatically receive 20% relief through the \"relief at source\" method, higher-rate (40%) and additional-rate (45%) earners must file a self-assessment tax return to claim the extra relief.\n\nA significant number of eligible taxpayers do not claim this relief—only 28% of estimated higher-rate and 88% of additional-rate taxpayers filed claims. Consequently, the average reclaim is £1,756 for higher-rate and £2,195 for additional-rate taxpayers. Experts warned that the actual unclaimed amount is likely even higher, as high earners are presumed to contribute more to pensions on average. The government’s freeze on income tax thresholds through 2031 could increase the number of people eligible for tax relief. Pension contributions via salary sacrifice automatically grant full relief, but most savers using relief at source must actively claim the extra tax relief through self-assessment.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1770012000,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/7624c501-2b0b-4f48-b65b-84b7d1ef6f61","title":"Millions more UK workers to be hit by Reeves' salary sacrifice changes","snippet":"A new analysis by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggests that Rachel Reeves’ proposed cap on tax benefits for salary sacrifice pension schemes could impact millions more UK workers than previously estimated. Initially, HMRC indicated that 4.3 million of the 7.7 million users of such schemes would be protected, with only those contributing over £2,000 annually affected. However, the OBR now warns that employers may respond by lowering wages and modifying pension contributions across their entire workforce, potentially spreading the cost burden more widely. It estimates that 76% of the cost of changes could be passed on to workers through reduced wages.\n\nThe Treasury maintains the reforms are targeted to shield low earners while addressing cost escalations from high earners exploiting tax-free bonuses. Beginning April 2029, contributions over £2,000 will incur standard National Insurance rates. The policy is expected to generate £4.7 billion for the Treasury by 2029-30, though reduced wages and profits may decrease this yield by £700 million. Critics, including former pensions minister Steve Webb and industry bodies, argue the changes may discourage pension saving and harm workers on modest incomes.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1770315127.516,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/measuring-tax-gaps","title":"Measuring tax gaps 2025 edition","snippet":"This report provides an estimate of the tax gap across all taxes and duties administered by HMRC.

Some are “spend”, some are “money not collected”, but they’re all real fiscal weight.\n\n**Debt interest**  \nThis is the purest “we’re paying for the past” line item. In 2024/25 it was **£106bn**. [Net debt interest spending was £106bn in 2024/25](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06167/).  \nIf you want the “why it feels like a scam” angle: it’s money that buys almost nothing except “we didn’t default”.\n\n**Pension tax relief**  \nA massive subsidy skewed toward higher earners (because relief is at your marginal rate). HMRC’s latest stats put the **cost around £59.1bn in 2025/26**. [Pension tax relief estimated at £59.1bn in 2025/26 (HMRC)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/tax-reliefs/tax-relief-statistics-january-2026).  \nIf your frame is fairness: this is “the state topping up wealth” in a way that’s hard to justify while people are being told there’s no money.\n\n**The tax gap**  \nNot “spending” in the accounts, but it’s the cleanest “money that should have been in our Treasury”. HMRC estimates **£46.8bn** for 2023/24. [Tax gap estimated at £46.8bn in 2023/24](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/measuring-tax-gaps/1-tax-gaps-summary).  \nA lot of it is small business non-compliance, but the headline works regardless: we’re leaking tens of billions.\n\n**Housing support flowing into private rents**  \nAgain: not “pro-immigration” or “anti-immigration”; it’s just a transfer from the state into landlords, driven by a broken housing market. Parliament gives **£12.3bn** of housing support to private rented sector tenants in 2023/24 (2024/25 prices). [PRS housing support £12.3bn in 2023/24](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2025-06-16/60301).  \nIf you want “bad deal” language: we’re paying for high rents instead of fixing supply, and the subsidy becomes fuel.\n\n**Benefit fraud + error overpayments**  \nJust under your threshold, but close enough to mention because it’s the same “state capacity is broken” vibe that people wrongly pin on migrants. DWP estimates **£9.7bn** overpaid in 2023/24. [£9.7bn overpaid due to fraud and error in 2023/24](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-financial-year-2023-to-2024-estimates).\n\nIf you want a neat contrast line you can lift:  \n“Asylum support is a single-digit-billions problem; debt interest, pension tax relief and the tax gap are **tens of billions** problems, every year.”\n\nIf you want, I’ll turn this into the same “curve over time” chart style as the Brexit graphic (debt interest, pension tax relief, tax gap, PRS housing support), with sources baked into the notes."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":2830,"end_idx":2830,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"ons.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/october2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com","title":"Public sector finances, UK: October 2025","snippet":"21 Nov 2025 — In October 2025, the public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income.

Farage's two-day trip to Davos cost more than £50,000, documents reveal","snippet":"Documents reveal that Nigel Farage’s two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos cost over £50,000, funded by Iranian-born billionaire Sasan Ghandehari via two guest passes. Despite previously criticizing the event, Farage accepted luxury accommodation worth £1,100 from the organizers and participated in the summit, where he pledged to challenge global elites. He was registered under HP Trust, Ghandehari’s family office, which manages a portfolio valued at over £10 billion. Although HP Trust claims Farage has served as an honorary adviser since 2018, he denies any formal role.\n\nThe trip’s funding and a separate £200,000 donation to Reform UK from Interior Architecture Landscape—a company with strong ties to the Ghandeharis—have raised questions. The firm, linked to conveyancer John Richard Simpson, maintains that all activities and donations are legitimate and UK-based. Farage also addressed media at Davos and clarified past comments about far-right figure Tommy Robinson, expressing regret over a previous misstatement. The Ghandehari family, wealthy from real estate and known for art collecting, has also been involved in legal disputes over art provenance.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1770229236,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/06/sasan-ghandehari-court-battle-picasso-art-farage-davos","title":"Court battle over Picasso art exposes offshore finances of Farage's billionaire Davos sponsor","snippet":"A high court dispute over a disputed Picasso painting purchase has exposed the offshore financial dealings of Sasan Ghandehari, a wealthy Iranian-born British businessman who previously funded Nigel Farage’s £50,000 trip to Davos. The case involves a £4 million claim by Brewer Management Corporation—allegedly owned by Ghandehari’s wife—against Christie's, accusing the auction house of misrepresentation. Christie's countersued for £16 million, asserting non-payment for the artwork \"Femme dans un rocking-chair.\" \n\nCourt documents revealed Ghandehari’s reluctance to disclose financial details from his $10 billion HP Trust. Though not a direct party, his connection as guarantor raised transparency concerns, especially given his financial backing of Farage and the Reform UK party. A £200,000 political donation by a design firm linked to a Ghandehari associate further complicated the picture.\n\nAt the heart of the case is Ghandehari's claim that Christie’s failed to disclose the seller's criminal history before the purchase agreement. The only asset offered as security was another painting of uncertain value and location. The judge allowed the case to proceed without additional security but demanded undertakings to potentially liquidate the painting to cover court costs. Christie's insists it complied fully with its legal obligations.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1770401927,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/nigel-farage-uses-private-company-to-pay-less-tax-on-gb-news-earnings","title":"Nigel Farage uses private company to pay less tax on GB ...","snippet":"5 Sept 2025 — The parliamentary register of interests shows that Farage has made nearly £400,000 from GB News since August 2024, for about 190 hours' work.Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":5},"pub_date":1757048418,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/13/nigel-farage-company-thorn-in-the-side-assets-up-400000","title":"'Skint' Nigel Farage's company assets grew almost £400k ...","snippet":"13 Mar 2019 — Thorn in the Side Ltd, of which Farage is the sole director, had assets of £548,573 for the year to May 2018 – a substantial jump from assets ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":14},"pub_date":1552508240,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/07/nigel-farage-paid-189000-last-year-by-gold-dealer-to-work-four-hours-a-month","title":"Nigel Farage paid £189,000 last year by gold company to work part-time","snippet":"Nigel Farage earned £189,000 in the past year as a part-time brand ambassador for Direct Bullion, a gold company, contributing to a total income of nearly £600,000 since becoming an MP in July.

In addition to his parliamentary role, Farage also works as a presenter for GB News, from which he has earned over £219,000 since July. He accrued income from various sources including speaking engagements, social media content, and personalized video messages.\n\nFarage also participated in Republican events in the U.S., notably a gala hosted by the New York Young Republican Club, where his expenses were covered, and where he praised Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Other US engagements included a £40,000 payment for a speech in Arizona, and a £32,000 trip financed by donor Christopher Harborne. These activities make him the UK’s highest-earning MP since the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer declared upgraded hospitality at Arsenal FC due to security, and other politicians, like Jeremy Hunt, reported accepted event tickets, following scrutiny over freebies in politics.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1736274364,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.facebook.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.facebook.com/libdems/posts/nigel-farage-has-been-paid-330000-by-gb-news-in-the-last-year-alonehes-deep-in-t/1419593269525337/","title":"Nigel Farage has been paid £330000 by GB News in the ...","snippet":"Nigel Farage has been paid £330000 by GB News in the last year alone.

battle over Picasso art exposes offshore finances of Farage's billionaire Davos sponsor","snippet":"A high court dispute over a disputed Picasso painting purchase has exposed the offshore financial dealings of Sasan Ghandehari, a wealthy Iranian-born British businessman who previously funded Nigel Farage’s £50,000 trip to Davos. The case involves a £4 million claim by Brewer Management Corporation—allegedly owned by Ghandehari’s wife—against Christie's, accusing the auction house of misrepresentation. Christie's countersued for £16 million, asserting non-payment for the artwork \"Femme dans un rocking-chair.\" \n\nCourt documents revealed Ghandehari’s reluctance to disclose financial details from his $10 billion HP Trust. Though not a direct party, his connection as guarantor raised transparency concerns, especially given his financial backing of Farage and the Reform UK party. A £200,000 political donation by a design firm linked to a Ghandehari associate further complicated the picture.\n\nAt the heart of the case is Ghandehari's claim that Christie’s failed to disclose the seller's criminal history before the purchase agreement. The only asset offered as security was another painting of uncertain value and location. The judge allowed the case to proceed without additional security but demanded undertakings to potentially liquidate the painting to cover court costs. Christie's insists it complied fully with its legal obligations.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":35},"pub_date":1770401927,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/04/nigel-farages-two-day-trip-to-davos-cost-more-than-50000-documents-reveal","title":"Nigel Farage's two-day trip to Davos cost more than £50,000, documents reveal","snippet":"Documents reveal that Nigel Farage’s two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos cost over £50,000, funded by Iranian-born billionaire Sasan Ghandehari via two guest passes. Despite previously criticizing the event, Farage accepted luxury accommodation worth £1,100 from the organizers and participated in the summit, where he pledged to challenge global elites. He was registered under HP Trust, Ghandehari’s family office, which manages a portfolio valued at over £10 billion. Although HP Trust claims Farage has served as an honorary adviser since 2018, he denies any formal role.\n\nThe trip’s funding and a separate £200,000 donation to Reform UK from Interior Architecture Landscape—a company with strong ties to the Ghandeharis—have raised questions. The firm, linked to conveyancer John Richard Simpson, maintains that all activities and donations are legitimate and UK-based. Farage also addressed media at Davos and clarified past comments about far-right figure Tommy Robinson, expressing regret over a previous misstatement. The Ghandehari family, wealthy from real estate and known for art collecting, has also been involved in legal disputes over art provenance.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":36},"pub_date":1770229236,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/reform-u-turn-on-two-child-benefit-cap-d9vjmndc3","title":"Reform drops promise to scrap two-child benefit cap","snippet":"Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has reversed his previous support for scrapping the two-child benefit cap, now advocating for retaining it to control the rising welfare budget and to finance tax cuts for the hospitality sector. Farage suggests that the estimated £3 billion savings from keeping the cap could reduce VAT by half for hospitality and cut beer duty by 10%. He also proposed scrapping business rates for pubs and reversing national insurance increases for hospitality employers, aiming to support pubs facing financial challenges.\n\nFarage emphasized a focus on aid for working families, proposing that the benefit cap only be lifted for households where both parents are British and in full-time work, covering approximately 3,700 of a potential 500,000 households. This pivot marks a move away from Reform UK’s earlier, more generous welfare pledges and aligns more closely with cost-cutting strategies.\n\nThe decision sets Reform UK apart from Labour, which has promised to abolish the cap, and the Conservatives, who originally introduced it. Critics, including the Conservatives, argue that Reform's calculations are flawed, leaving a potential £10.5 billion gap in their funding plan. Meanwhile, legislation to remove the cap passed a key parliamentary stage with broad support.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":37},"pub_date":1770144631,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"open.endole.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://open.endole.co.uk/insight/company/13066592-farage-media-limited","title":"Farage Media Limited - Company Profile","snippet":"Net Assets, Total Assets & Total Liabilities (2021–2024).

Farage's two-day trip to Davos cost more than £50,000, documents reveal","snippet":"Documents reveal that Nigel Farage’s two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos cost over £50,000, funded by Iranian-born billionaire Sasan Ghandehari via two guest passes. Despite previously criticizing the event, Farage accepted luxury accommodation worth £1,100 from the organizers and participated in the summit, where he pledged to challenge global elites. He was registered under HP Trust, Ghandehari’s family office, which manages a portfolio valued at over £10 billion. Although HP Trust claims Farage has served as an honorary adviser since 2018, he denies any formal role.\n\nThe trip’s funding and a separate £200,000 donation to Reform UK from Interior Architecture Landscape—a company with strong ties to the Ghandeharis—have raised questions. The firm, linked to conveyancer John Richard Simpson, maintains that all activities and donations are legitimate and UK-based. Farage also addressed media at Davos and clarified past comments about far-right figure Tommy Robinson, expressing regret over a previous misstatement. The Ghandehari family, wealthy from real estate and known for art collecting, has also been involved in legal disputes over art provenance.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1770229236,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/06/sasan-ghandehari-court-battle-picasso-art-farage-davos","title":"Court battle over Picasso art exposes offshore finances of Farage's billionaire Davos sponsor","snippet":"A high court dispute over a disputed Picasso painting purchase has exposed the offshore financial dealings of Sasan Ghandehari, a wealthy Iranian-born British businessman who previously funded Nigel Farage’s £50,000 trip to Davos. The case involves a £4 million claim by Brewer Management Corporation—allegedly owned by Ghandehari’s wife—against Christie's, accusing the auction house of misrepresentation. Christie's countersued for £16 million, asserting non-payment for the artwork \"Femme dans un rocking-chair.\" \n\nCourt documents revealed Ghandehari’s reluctance to disclose financial details from his $10 billion HP Trust. Though not a direct party, his connection as guarantor raised transparency concerns, especially given his financial backing of Farage and the Reform UK party. A £200,000 political donation by a design firm linked to a Ghandehari associate further complicated the picture.\n\nAt the heart of the case is Ghandehari's claim that Christie’s failed to disclose the seller's criminal history before the purchase agreement. The only asset offered as security was another painting of uncertain value and location. The judge allowed the case to proceed without additional security but demanded undertakings to potentially liquidate the painting to cover court costs. Christie's insists it complied fully with its legal obligations.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1770401927,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/aug/16/nigel-farage-revealed-to-be-uks-highest-earning-mp","title":"Nigel Farage revealed to be UK's highest-earning MP","snippet":"Nigel Farage has been revealed as the UK’s highest-earning MP, declaring an annual income of nearly £1.2 million largely due to his role as a GB News presenter, earning £97,900 per month. Additional earnings include social media platforms, Cameo videos, and a £4,000 monthly fee from the Daily Telegraph. His overseas trips, including a £32,000 visit to the US and a £9,250 visit to Brussels, were funded by political allies Christopher Harborne and George Cottrell. Cottrell, a former convict, remains close to Farage's political circle.\n\nThis development places Farage ahead of the previous top-earning MP, Geoffrey Cox, who earns over £670,000 from his legal work. Critics, such as Good Law Project’s Jo Maugham, questioned whether this level of private income aligns with the responsibilities of public service.\n\nThe register also highlights significant political donations. Labour Together, a think tank aligned with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, provided nearly £900,000 to support 106 Labour candidates in the general election, with funds aimed mostly at new or unelected candidates. The think tank also funded staffing for several key ministers.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":1723836091,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thesun.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/38101908/nigel-farage-tax-cuts-pubs-two-child-benefit-cap/","title":"Nigel Farage pledges tax cuts for pubs funded by reinstating the two-child benefit cap","snippet":"Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has announced a five-point support package focused on revitalizing British pubs. The plan includes cutting beer duty by 10%, progressively abolishing business rates for pubs, reducing VAT to 10%, and eliminating the recent rise in employers' national insurance for the hospitality sector. To fund these measures, Farage intends to reinstate the two-child benefit cap, with exceptions for working households composed of British citizens, aiming to save £3 billion and make the initiative cost-neutral. Reform MP Lee Anderson emphasized the cultural and communal importance of pubs and criticized current government policies for contributing to their decline.

His role involved working four hours a month and included a back payment for earlier work. In addition to his parliamentary role, Farage also works as a presenter for GB News, from which he has earned over £219,000 since July. He accrued income from various sources including speaking engagements, social media content, and personalized video messages.\n\nFarage also participated in Republican events in the U.S., notably a gala hosted by the New York Young Republican Club, where his expenses were covered, and where he praised Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Other US engagements included a £40,000 payment for a speech in Arizona, and a £32,000 trip financed by donor Christopher Harborne. These activities make him the UK’s highest-earning MP since the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer declared upgraded hospitality at Arsenal FC due to security, and other politicians, like Jeremy Hunt, reported accepted event tickets, following scrutiny over freebies in politics.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1736274364,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/aug/16/nigel-farage-revealed-to-be-uks-highest-earning-mp","title":"Nigel Farage revealed to be UK's highest-earning MP","snippet":"Nigel Farage has been revealed as the UK’s highest-earning MP, declaring an annual income of nearly £1.2 million largely due to his role as a GB News presenter, earning £97,900 per month. Additional earnings include social media platforms, Cameo videos, and a £4,000 monthly fee from the Daily Telegraph. His overseas trips, including a £32,000 visit to the US and a £9,250 visit to Brussels, were funded by political allies Christopher Harborne and George Cottrell. Cottrell, a former convict, remains close to Farage's political circle.\n\nThis development places Farage ahead of the previous top-earning MP, Geoffrey Cox, who earns over £670,000 from his legal work. Critics, such as Good Law Project’s Jo Maugham, questioned whether this level of private income aligns with the responsibilities of public service.\n\nThe register also highlights significant political donations. Labour Together, a think tank aligned with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, provided nearly £900,000 to support 106 Labour candidates in the general election, with funds aimed mostly at new or unelected candidates. The think tank also funded staffing for several key ministers.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1723836091,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.facebook.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/550171758376588/posts/25569548489345569/","title":"Nigel Farage was born in Kent in 1964, not into ...","snippet":"Starmer's net worth is around £7.7 million ...

Since the July 4 election, Farage has earned nearly £1.4 million primarily through media and speaking engagements, including from GB News, Cameo, and Direct Bullion. He attributed the administrative failures to his lack of computer literacy and disruptions caused by his unexpectedly rapid political rise, saying he relied on aides to manage the declarations. Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Daniel Greenberg determined the breaches were “inadvertent” and did not escalate the case further. Despite accepting full responsibility and expressing regret, Farage emphasized the complexity of his financial activities. A Labour spokesperson criticized Farage for failing basic parliamentary responsibilities while profiting from external work. Farage also pledged to expand his staff and improve systems amidst growing demands.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":43},"pub_date":1769018031,"attribution":"www.thetimes.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_698971daf96883209c65851d7beca3cc","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching web for Nigel Farage early career earnings","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"57b22381-3d83-4d37-8551-badc48d8edc7","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"2ae686dd-46f2-4e7b-8251-b3bd999ed0ab","turn_exchange_id":"4a22b4c8-083e-4e15-90a1-3c72167a86cb","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2ae686dd-46f2-4e7b-8251-b3bd999ed0ab","children":["ddf0eee8-8259-4611-8053-ce5a26f923db"]},"ddf0eee8-8259-4611-8053-ce5a26f923db":{"id":"ddf0eee8-8259-4611-8053-ce5a26f923db","message":{"id":"ddf0eee8-8259-4611-8053-ce5a26f923db","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770615275.479449,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Gathering and organizing Farage's net worth estimates","content":"I’ll gather sources to estimate Farage’s net worth by era.

Additional earnings include social media platforms, Cameo videos, and a £4,000 monthly fee from the Daily Telegraph. His overseas trips, including a £32,000 visit to the US and a £9,250 visit to Brussels, were funded by political allies Christopher Harborne and George Cottrell. Cottrell, a former convict, remains close to Farage's political circle.\n\nThis development places Farage ahead of the previous top-earning MP, Geoffrey Cox, who earns over £670,000 from his legal work. Critics, such as Good Law Project’s Jo Maugham, questioned whether this level of private income aligns with the responsibilities of public service.\n\nThe register also highlights significant political donations. Labour Together, a think tank aligned with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, provided nearly £900,000 to support 106 Labour candidates in the general election, with funds aimed mostly at new or unelected candidates. The think tank also funded staffing for several key ministers.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn1news39","start_idx":1908,"end_idx":1926,"safe_urls":["https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/07/nigel-farage-paid-189000-last-year-by-gold-dealer-to-work-four-hours-a-month","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/07/nigel-farage-paid-189000-last-year-by-gold-dealer-to-work-four-hours-a-month?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/07/nigel-farage-paid-189000-last-year-by-gold-dealer-to-work-four-hours-a-month?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Nigel Farage paid £189,000 last year by gold company to work part-time","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/07/nigel-farage-paid-189000-last-year-by-gold-dealer-to-work-four-hours-a-month?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1736274364,"snippet":"Nigel Farage earned £189,000 in the past year as a part-time brand ambassador for Direct Bullion, a gold company, contributing to a total income of nearly £600,000 since becoming an MP in July. His role involved working four hours a month and included a back payment for earlier work. In addition to his parliamentary role, Farage also works as a presenter for GB News, from which he has earned over £219,000 since July. He accrued income from various sources including speaking engagements, social media content, and personalized video messages.\n\nFarage also participated in Republican events in the U.S., notably a gala hosted by the New York Young Republican Club, where his expenses were covered, and where he praised Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Other US engagements included a £40,000 payment for a speech in Arizona, and a £32,000 trip financed by donor Christopher Harborne. These activities make him the UK’s highest-earning MP since the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer declared upgraded hospitality at Arsenal FC due to security, and other politicians, like Jeremy Hunt, reported accepted event tickets, following scrutiny over freebies in politics.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn0search10turn0search6","start_idx":2012,"end_idx":2045,"safe_urls":["https://members.parliament.uk/member/5091/registeredinterests","https://members.parliament.uk/member/5091/registeredinterests?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theyworkforyou.com/regmem/?p=26352","https://www.theyworkforyou.com/regmem/?p=26352&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([UK Parliament](https://members.parliament.uk/member/5091/registeredinterests?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Register of Interests for Nigel Farage - MPs and Lords","url":"https://members.parliament.uk/member/5091/registeredinterests?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"1.

Farage has been revealed as the UK’s highest-earning MP, declaring an annual income of nearly £1.2 million largely due to his role as a GB News presenter, earning £97,900 per month. Additional earnings include social media platforms, Cameo videos, and a £4,000 monthly fee from the Daily Telegraph. His overseas trips, including a £32,000 visit to the US and a £9,250 visit to Brussels, were funded by political allies Christopher Harborne and George Cottrell. Cottrell, a former convict, remains close to Farage's political circle.\n\nThis development places Farage ahead of the previous top-earning MP, Geoffrey Cox, who earns over £670,000 from his legal work. Critics, such as Good Law Project’s Jo Maugham, questioned whether this level of private income aligns with the responsibilities of public service.\n\nThe register also highlights significant political donations. Labour Together, a think tank aligned with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, provided nearly £900,000 to support 106 Labour candidates in the general election, with funds aimed mostly at new or unelected candidates. The think tank also funded staffing for several key ministers.","attribution":"The Guardian"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0},{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":3},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Find and Update Company Information"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn1news39turn0search10turn0search6","start_idx":3966,"end_idx":4011,"safe_urls":["https://members.parliament.uk/member/5091/registeredinterests","https://members.parliament.uk/member/5091/registeredinterests?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/07/nigel-farage-paid-189000-last-year-by-gold-dealer-to-work-four-hours-a-month","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/07/nigel-farage-paid-189000-last-year-by-gold-dealer-to-work-four-hours-a-month?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theyworkforyou.com/regmem/?p=26352","https://www.theyworkforyou.com/regmem/?p=26352&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/07/nigel-farage-paid-189000-last-year-by-gold-dealer-to-work-four-hours-a-month?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Nigel Farage paid £189,000 last year by gold company to work part-time","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/07/nigel-farage-paid-189000-last-year-by-gold-dealer-to-work-four-hours-a-month?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1736274364,"snippet":"Nigel Farage earned £189,000 in the past year as a part-time brand ambassador for Direct Bullion, a gold company, contributing to a total income of nearly £600,000 since becoming an MP in July. His role involved working four hours a month and included a back payment for earlier work. In addition to his parliamentary role, Farage also works as a presenter for GB News, from which he has earned over £219,000 since July. He accrued income from various sources including speaking engagements, social media content, and personalized video messages.\n\nFarage also participated in Republican events in the U.S., notably a gala hosted by the New York Young Republican Club, where his expenses were covered, and where he praised Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Other US engagements included a £40,000 payment for a speech in Arizona, and a £32,000 trip financed by donor Christopher Harborne. These activities make him the UK’s highest-earning MP since the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer declared upgraded hospitality at Arsenal FC due to security, and other politicians, like Jeremy Hunt, reported accepted event tickets, following scrutiny over freebies in politics.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Register of Interests for Nigel Farage - MPs and Lords","url":"https://members.parliament.uk/member/5091/registeredinterests?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"1.

Farage's two-day trip to Davos cost more than £50,000, documents reveal","snippet":"Documents reveal that Nigel Farage’s two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos cost over £50,000, funded by Iranian-born billionaire Sasan Ghandehari via two guest passes. Despite previously criticizing the event, Farage accepted luxury accommodation worth £1,100 from the organizers and participated in the summit, where he pledged to challenge global elites. He was registered under HP Trust, Ghandehari’s family office, which manages a portfolio valued at over £10 billion. Although HP Trust claims Farage has served as an honorary adviser since 2018, he denies any formal role.\n\nThe trip’s funding and a separate £200,000 donation to Reform UK from Interior Architecture Landscape—a company with strong ties to the Ghandeharis—have raised questions. The firm, linked to conveyancer John Richard Simpson, maintains that all activities and donations are legitimate and UK-based. Farage also addressed media at Davos and clarified past comments about far-right figure Tommy Robinson, expressing regret over a previous misstatement. The Ghandehari family, wealthy from real estate and known for art collecting, has also been involved in legal disputes over art provenance.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":38},"pub_date":1770229236,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/06/sasan-ghandehari-court-battle-picasso-art-farage-davos","title":"Court battle over Picasso art exposes offshore finances of Farage's billionaire Davos sponsor","snippet":"A high court dispute over a disputed Picasso painting purchase has exposed the offshore financial dealings of Sasan Ghandehari, a wealthy Iranian-born British businessman who previously funded Nigel Farage’s £50,000 trip to Davos. The case involves a £4 million claim by Brewer Management Corporation—allegedly owned by Ghandehari’s wife—against Christie's, accusing the auction house of misrepresentation. Christie's countersued for £16 million, asserting non-payment for the artwork \"Femme dans un rocking-chair.\" \n\nCourt documents revealed Ghandehari’s reluctance to disclose financial details from his $10 billion HP Trust. Though not a direct party, his connection as guarantor raised transparency concerns, especially given his financial backing of Farage and the Reform UK party. A £200,000 political donation by a design firm linked to a Ghandehari associate further complicated the picture.\n\nAt the heart of the case is Ghandehari's claim that Christie’s failed to disclose the seller's criminal history before the purchase agreement. The only asset offered as security was another painting of uncertain value and location. The judge allowed the case to proceed without additional security but demanded undertakings to potentially liquidate the painting to cover court costs. Christie's insists it complied fully with its legal obligations.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1770401927,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/nigel-farage-uses-private-company-to-pay-less-tax-on-gb-news-earnings","title":"Nigel Farage uses private company to pay less tax on GB ...","snippet":"5 Sept 2025 — The latest accounts show that as of 31 May 2024, the company had £1.7m in cash, up over £1m in a year.

The breaches, mostly occurring in 2025, were deemed unintentional by Parliament's Standards Commissioner Daniel Greenberg, who attributed them to staffing and administrative shortcomings.

What’s publicly visible is: one company with low-single-digit millions in assets, plus high income in the last few years.\n\nA quick sanity check: to build **£50m** from “being well paid” you need something like:\n\n- net investable surplus of **£1.5m/year for 25–30 years**, *or*\n- a big lump event (sale of a business stake, inheritance, etc.), *or*\n- substantial assets held somewhere you can’t see (offshore structures, trusts, property via nominees).\n\nNone of those are evidenced in the normal public places people point to for UK public figures (Companies House accounts; Parliament’s register; court records; major asset purchases reported in mainstream outlets).

Despite previously criticizing the event, Farage accepted luxury accommodation worth £1,100 from the organizers and participated in the summit, where he pledged to challenge global elites. He was registered under HP Trust, Ghandehari’s family office, which manages a portfolio valued at over £10 billion. Although HP Trust claims Farage has served as an honorary adviser since 2018, he denies any formal role.\n\nThe trip’s funding and a separate £200,000 donation to Reform UK from Interior Architecture Landscape—a company with strong ties to the Ghandeharis—have raised questions. The firm, linked to conveyancer John Richard Simpson, maintains that all activities and donations are legitimate and UK-based. Farage also addressed media at Davos and clarified past comments about far-right figure Tommy Robinson, expressing regret over a previous misstatement. The Ghandehari family, wealthy from real estate and known for art collecting, has also been involved in legal disputes over art provenance.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Court battle over Picasso art exposes offshore finances of Farage's billionaire Davos sponsor","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/06/sasan-ghandehari-court-battle-picasso-art-farage-davos?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"A high court dispute over a disputed Picasso painting purchase has exposed the offshore financial dealings of Sasan Ghandehari, a wealthy Iranian-born British businessman who previously funded Nigel Farage’s £50,000 trip to Davos. The case involves a £4 million claim by Brewer Management Corporation—allegedly owned by Ghandehari’s wife—against Christie's, accusing the auction house of misrepresentation. Christie's countersued for £16 million, asserting non-payment for the artwork \"Femme dans un rocking-chair.\" \n\nCourt documents revealed Ghandehari’s reluctance to disclose financial details from his $10 billion HP Trust. Though not a direct party, his connection as guarantor raised transparency concerns, especially given his financial backing of Farage and the Reform UK party. A £200,000 political donation by a design firm linked to a Ghandehari associate further complicated the picture.\n\nAt the heart of the case is Ghandehari's claim that Christie’s failed to disclose the seller's criminal history before the purchase agreement. The only asset offered as security was another painting of uncertain value and location. The judge allowed the case to proceed without additional security but demanded undertakings to potentially liquidate the painting to cover court costs.

By directing nearly £400,000 in media income into the company, he pays 25% corporation tax instead of the 40% personal income tax rate and can claim business expense deductions. Farage, who also earns £94,000 annually as an MP, has been previously critical of tax avoiders, yet has used offshore trusts and avoided higher-rate stamp duty on a property bought under his partner’s name.\n\nWhile legal, the use of personal service companies for tax minimization has come under increased scrutiny and regulation, especially from HMRC’s tightened IR35 rules. Broadcasters like the BBC and ITV have moved away from such arrangements. Thorn in the Side Ltd has assets worth £2.6 million, including £1.7 million in cash and two investment properties.\n\nFarage has declined to release his recent tax returns. Despite criticism, he downplayed similar allegations against Deputy PM Angela Rayner. This comes amid his rising political profile and more radical rhetoric in the U.S., where he supported Trump’s hardline migration policies.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":7},"pub_date":1757048418,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.threads.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.threads.com/%40nickrphotograph/post/DCRV5HusYWe?hl=en-gb","title":"Fun fact: Farridge's personal company (not his political one ...","snippet":"12 Nov 2024 — Farridge's personal company (not his political one) is called “Thorn In The Side Ltd.”, proving that he is doing, and has always intended to do and make a ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":8},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.threads.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/42c5f8ed-9c93-4158-a3da-22ea6feb6a65","title":"Nigel Farage's media company records £1.25mn profit","snippet":"Nigel Farage's media company, Thorn in The Side Ltd, reported a profit of £1.25 million for the financial year ending May 31, 2024, largely driven by his £1.5 million appearance fee on the ITV reality show \"I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!\" Ahead of the 2024 UK general election, Farage used the show as a media opportunity before returning to front-line politics, where he secured a parliamentary seat as one of five Reform UK MPs. His company also saw a £1.4 million increase in cash reserves.\n\nApart from television, Farage has generated income from GB News, where he has earned £265,000 since becoming an MP, as well as from paid speeches, writing, Cameo videos, and brand promotion for gold bullion firm Direct Bullion, for which he was paid £280,000. He also monetized social media posts on Elon Musk’s X platform, earning nearly £10,000 post-election.\n\nFarage's media activities are channeled through Thorn in The Side Ltd, of which he is the sole owner. Additionally, he holds significant shares in GB News. Donors like Christopher Harborne and George Cottrell have funded his recent US travel. Reform UK has since surged in polls, outperforming Labour and the Conservatives.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":33},"pub_date":1740581453.355,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69897918108c832ab42ca0caf2844606","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching company name origins and related interviews","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"b6f921f1-641f-4f7e-b309-5eb1e70f7da0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"1ad400bf-d61e-4476-ac08-56d2dd7df993","turn_exchange_id":"f9c9f6f0-fa70-4db5-a70c-cc9f837e19aa","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1ad400bf-d61e-4476-ac08-56d2dd7df993","children":["9123a531-4f6c-4f1d-8815-6051f86f6304"]},"9123a531-4f6c-4f1d-8815-6051f86f6304":{"id":"9123a531-4f6c-4f1d-8815-6051f86f6304","message":{"id":"9123a531-4f6c-4f1d-8815-6051f86f6304","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770617113.541075,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"open\":[{\"ref_id\":\"turn0search2\"},{\"ref_id\":\"turn0search6\"},{\"ref_id\":\"turn0news33\"}],\"response_length\":\"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-68acbab14fe08191bfa946c0512151e3","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for company name origin and financial sources","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"b6f921f1-641f-4f7e-b309-5eb1e70f7da0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"87d4ddba-fe85-4b3c-98b3-ac6130cfb929","turn_exchange_id":"f9c9f6f0-fa70-4db5-a70c-cc9f837e19aa","model_switcher_deny":[],"can_save":true},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"87d4ddba-fe85-4b3c-98b3-ac6130cfb929","children":["aec61800-5cda-4f06-9408-2fc59f2f8920"]},"aec61800-5cda-4f06-9408-2fc59f2f8920":{"id":"aec61800-5cda-4f06-9408-2fc59f2f8920","message":{"id":"aec61800-5cda-4f06-9408-2fc59f2f8920","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1770617119.0834963,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/07650770/filing-history","title":"THORN IN THE SIDE LIMITED filing history - Find and update company information - GOV.UK","snippet":"Total lines: 186\n","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/03/nigel-farage-uses-private-company-reduce-tax-bill-ukip","title":"Nigel Farage uses private company to reduce tax bill | Nigel Farage | The Guardian","snippet":"Total lines: 239\n","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":1},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/42c5f8ed-9c93-4158-a3da-22ea6feb6a65","title":"Subscribe to read","snippet":"Total lines: 460\n","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":2},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_69897918108c832ab42ca0caf2844606","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for company name origin and financial sources","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"b6f921f1-641f-4f7e-b309-5eb1e70f7da0","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"9123a531-4f6c-4f1d-8815-6051f86f6304","turn_exchange_id":"f9c9f6f0-fa70-4db5-a70c-cc9f837e19aa","can_save":false},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9123a531-4f6c-4f1d-8815-6051f86f6304","children":["0f8cb470-6dc8-4c80-b3f0-c185bfec4078"]},"0f8cb470-6dc8-4c80-b3f0-c185bfec4078":{"id":"0f8cb470-6dc8-4c80-b3f0-c185bfec4078","message":{"id":"0f8cb470-6dc8-4c80-b3f0-c185bfec4078","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770617124.464173,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Finding accessible sources for name origin and research","content":"I’m thinking I need to find other accessible sources like Reuters or ITV for this, since paywalled sources aren't helpful.

Although the inquiry found she acted in good faith, it cited failure to heed legal advice that suggested specialist tax counsel. In response, Prime Minister Keir Starmer initiated a major cabinet reshuffle.\n\nKey appointments include David Lammy as Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary, Yvette Cooper as Foreign Secretary, and Shabana Mahmood as Home Secretary. Additional changes saw Steve Reed take over housing, Peter Kyle become Business Secretary, and Douglas Alexander return as Scotland Secretary. Rachel Reeves remained Chancellor.\n\nStarmer's reshuffle aimed to stabilize a government reeling from the Rayner controversy and threats from Reform UK, which held its own high-profile conference. At that event, Nigel Farage touted aggressive immigration policies and unveiled Nadine Dorries as a new ally. Internal Labour challenges loom, including a leadership contest to replace Rayner, as critics question the government's credibility amidst rising political tensions.","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42},"pub_date":1757099609,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage","title":"Nigel Farage","snippet":"","ref_id":{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4},"pub_date":null,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"x.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://x.com/search?f=live&q=SIDE+MEDIA+LTD","title":"\"SIDE MEDIA LTD\" - Results on X | Live Posts & Updates","snippet":"Nigel Farage is the sole owner and director of the company Thorn in the Side Ltd.

Get Me Out Of Here!\" Ahead of the 2024 UK general election, Farage used the show as a media opportunity before returning to front-line politics, where he secured a parliamentary seat as one of five Reform UK MPs. His company also saw a £1.4 million increase in cash reserves.\n\nApart from television, Farage has generated income from GB News, where he has earned £265,000 since becoming an MP, as well as from paid speeches, writing, Cameo videos, and brand promotion for gold bullion firm Direct Bullion, for which he was paid £280,000. He also monetized social media posts on Elon Musk’s X platform, earning nearly £10,000 post-election.\n\nFarage's media activities are channeled through Thorn in The Side Ltd, of which he is the sole owner. Additionally, he holds significant shares in GB News. Donors like Christopher Harborne and George Cottrell have funded his recent US travel.

Companies House filings don’t include a “why we picked this” note, and the coverage that mentions the company treats the name as a given, not a story. The earliest hard fact is just that **Thorn In The Side Ltd was incorporated in 2011** and is used as his personal service/media vehicle. citeturn1view1turn1view0\n\nSo the best you can honestly say is: it’s a bog-standard idiom that matches his self-brand (“I exist to be an irritant to the establishment”), and it reads like a deliberate bit of political theatre. But unless a memoir/interview turns up, that’s inference.\n\nOn “there’s no way he’s only worth a few million”: you’re mixing up two different claims.\n\n1) **The company** is not “his whole wealth” — agreed — but it’s still a real window into what’s been accumulated in his most obvious UK bucket. And that bucket is now not trivial: the 2024 accounts (as reported) put the company at **~£2.6m of assets including ~£1.7m cash and two investment properties**. citeturn2news41\n\n2) “He must be £50m+” is a *separate* claim, and that’s the bit that needs receipts. To get to £50m you generally need one of:\n- a big equity stake in something valuable (sold or still held),\n- a property portfolio of that scale,\n- a long run of very high investable surplus,\n- or assets held in structures you won’t see in UK company accounts / routine disclosures.\n\nWhat we **do** have, and it supports “he’s doing very nicely”:\n- He’s used Thorn In The Side to take media/lecture money in company form for years. citeturn1view1turn2news41\n- His recent media earnings look huge. (Even the conservative reporting has him routing large sums through that vehicle.) citeturn2news41\n\nBut what we **don’t** have publicly (at least in anything I can point at cleanly right now) is a reliable inventory of: personal property holdings, offshore structures, brokerage accounts, private stakes, liabilities, settlements, etc. Without that, “£50m” can be true, but it’s not something you can state as a “best estimate” rather than a suspicion.\n\nIf you want to actually “look for things” in a way you can cite in an evidence pack, the next places to mine are:\n- **Companies House**: check whether he controls other UK companies beyond Thorn In The Side (and whether any have meaningful balance sheets). Start from the filing history and PSC trail. citeturn1view0\n- **MP Register of Interests** for shareholdings and paid roles (it’s income/holdings, not net worth, but it can reveal equity positions that later become valuable). citeturn2search4\n- **Credible reporting** that itemises assets/vehicles (Guardian/FT/Reuters pieces sometimes do; the Guardian 2014 story is one of the few that went into the mechanics). citeturn1view1turn2news41\n\nIf you want, I’ll redo the chart with three bands:\n- **hard floor** (company net assets)\n- **“publicly evidenced lower bound”** (floor + reported income retained at plausible after-tax rates)\n- **“speculative upper bound”** (what would need to be true for £50m, shown as a dotted scenario line)\n\nThat way you get something you can publish without pretending the upper number is known."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"citeturn1view1turn1view0","start_idx":354,"end_idx":382,"safe_urls":["https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/07650770/filing-history","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/03/nigel-farage-uses-private-company-reduce-tax-bill-ukip"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/03/nigel-farage-uses-private-company-reduce-tax-bill-ukip))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Nigel Farage uses private company to reduce tax bill | Nigel Farage | The Guardian","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/03/nigel-farage-uses-private-company-reduce-tax-bill-ukip","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"THORN IN THE SIDE LIMITED filing history - Find and update company information - GOV.UK","url":"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/07650770/filing-history","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution":"Find and Update Company Information"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":1},{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn2news41","start_idx":1040,"end_idx":1058,"safe_urls":["https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/nigel-farage-uses-private-company-to-pay-less-tax-on-gb-news-earnings","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/nigel-farage-uses-private-company-to-pay-less-tax-on-gb-news-earnings?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/nigel-farage-uses-private-company-to-pay-less-tax-on-gb-news-earnings?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Nigel Farage uses private company to pay less tax on GB News earnings","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/nigel-farage-uses-private-company-to-pay-less-tax-on-gb-news-earnings?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1757048418,"snippet":"Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK and MP for Clacton, has used a private company—Thorn in the Side Ltd—to reduce his tax liabilities on earnings from GB News and other ventures.

By directing nearly £400,000 in media income into the company, he pays 25% corporation tax instead of the 40% personal income tax rate and can claim business expense deductions. Farage, who also earns £94,000 annually as an MP, has been previously critical of tax avoiders, yet has used offshore trusts and avoided higher-rate stamp duty on a property bought under his partner’s name.\n\nWhile legal, the use of personal service companies for tax minimization has come under increased scrutiny and regulation, especially from HMRC’s tightened IR35 rules. Broadcasters like the BBC and ITV have moved away from such arrangements. Thorn in the Side Ltd has assets worth £2.6 million, including £1.7 million in cash and two investment properties.\n\nFarage has declined to release his recent tax returns.

Rich people stand next to broke people all the time if the broke person is useful. In politics and media it’s almost the rule: attention, legitimacy, and agenda-setting are currencies, and they’re tradable without the “asset” ever sitting on your Companies House balance sheet.\n\nWhat you’re probably sensing is real, but it doesn’t imply “he personally has £50m+”. It implies one (or more) of these:\n\n- he’s a paid front man (cashflow big, wealth maybe not huge if it’s spent, taxed, settled, or not saved)\n- he has backers underwriting lifestyle/security/travel/ops (benefit in kind, not “net worth”)\n- he’s got opaque revenue channels (offshore, trusts, family arrangements, non-UK entities)\n- he’s carrying significant liabilities (so the money comes in and goes straight back out)\n- he’s got a high-income, low-asset profile (common with media personalities)\n\nIf you want to turn “he’s obviously getting paid somehow” into something you can print, you need to separate **(A) income streams**, **(B) asset ownership**, and **(C) in-kind support**. They leave different footprints.\n\n### A) Income streams: where the money comes from\nYou’re not looking for “net worth”; you’re looking for recurring counterparties.\n\n- **UK Parliament Register of Interests**: payments, roles, shareholdings. It’s not complete, but it’s the best official ledger of “who paid him for what”. It’s machine-scrapable and timestamped.\n- **Company accounts** (Thorn In The Side and any other entities he controls): not just net assets — look at turnover, creditors, dividends, related-party transactions, cash movements.\n- **Speaking / appearances**: often routed through agencies and paid to a company. You won’t get every invoice, but you can often find rate cards, leaked contracts, and event budgets, plus whether it’s paid to him or a vehicle.\n\n### B) Asset ownership: where wealth sits\nThis is where “£50m” would have to show up somehow.\n\n- **Property**: in the UK, you can’t just “guess” — you check Land Registry titles (paid per title). If he has a portfolio, it will exist as title records, sometimes via companies/trusts.\n- **Equity stakes**: if he owns meaningful chunks of UK companies, it’s in PSC filings or cap tables (for private firms, often not visible unless accounts disclose it).\n- **Offshore**: you don’t get a clean list unless it leaks or is litigated, but you can still look for indirect hints: UK companies paying “consultancy” to non-UK entities, unusual creditor lines, loans to directors, etc.\n\n### C) In-kind support: the “network money” that doesn’t look like his money\nThis is the part that makes someone look “£50m rich” without them being £50m rich importing cash into their own name.\n\n- travel, security, accommodation, event production paid by others\n- “sponsorship” arrangements (conferences, donors, media backers)\n- legal costs quietly covered\n- staff/office support routed through third parties\n\nThat stuff is exactly how political operators can live like millionaires without “owning” the millions.\n\nIf you want the honest punchline for your argument: **it’s plausible Farage is personally only single-digit millions while operating inside a £50m-plus donor ecosystem**. That isn’t a defence of him — it’s the mechanism. The power comes from being a node in a patronage network, not from personally sitting on a yacht-sized asset pile.\n\nIf you want, I’ll do a structured “follow-the-money” checklist tailored to him (UK entities list → filings to pull → what numbers matter in the accounts → what to look for that screams “money leaving the visible system”), and we can turn it into an evidence-pack section you can actually cite without hand-waving."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":" ","start_idx":3719,"end_idx":3719,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"","prompt_text":null,"type":"sources_footnote","sources":[],"has_images":false}],"safe_urls":[],"citations":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-68acbab14fe08191bfa946c0512151e3","search_result_groups":[],"request_id":"00243594-a2c6-4900-ab74-3339a5088a7d","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-2-thinking","thinking_effort":"standard","parent_id":"ba39b189-a7b3-47d5-9c7a-34531d28bcbe","turn_exchange_id":"2e3e87af-e27a-405f-87fd-0b2cb8fa6fde","model_switcher_deny":[],"can_save":true},"recipient":"all","channel":"final"},"parent":"ba39b189-a7b3-47d5-9c7a-34531d28bcbe","children":["77bd0893-eb92-4d9f-a41b-15361b7dcdcb"]},"77bd0893-eb92-4d9f-a41b-15361b7dcdcb":{"id":"77bd0893-eb92-4d9f-a41b-15361b7dcdcb","message":{"id":"77bd0893-eb92-4d9f-a41b-15361b7dcdcb","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1770617413.741,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["ah, you're intepreting net worth 'literally' and only 'fiscally', not the casual use of worth.

pollster's nightmare': stakes are high in three-way fight for Gorton and Denton","snippet":"The upcoming by-election in Gorton and Denton, Greater Manchester, presents a tense three-way race between Labour, Reform UK, and the Green Party. Labour's 13,000-vote majority is under threat following the resignation of MP Andrew Gwynne due to a scandal. Labour candidate Angeliki Stogia emotionally criticized Reform UK's divisive rhetoric and expressed concern the Green Party's campaign could split the left-wing vote, benefiting Reform UK.\n\nThe Green Party, despite lacking local councillors and trailing Labour by 14,000 votes in 2024, has seen a surge in support, led by its energetic candidate Hannah Spencer. Backed by grassroots enthusiasm and endorsements from George Galloway's Workers Party, Jeremy Corbyn’s Your Party, and the Muslim Vote campaign group, the Greens are gaining traction, especially in diverse neighbourhoods disaffected by Labour’s stance on issues like Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, Reform UK has deployed media figure Matt Goodwin, though some locals see him as opportunistic. Voters are divided, with some feeling Labour betrayed them, others wary of Reform, and many intrigued by the fresh approach of the Greens. Experts predict an unpredictable outcome, calling it a \"pollster’s nightmare\" with any of the three parties plausibly able to win.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":39},"pub_date":1770552031,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/04/labour-reform-greens-splitting-vote-unfair-electoral-system","title":"If Reform ever wins power in Westminster, it will be because of Labour's cowardice","snippet":"In a sharply critical piece, George Monbiot argues that if the far-right Reform UK ever comes to power in Westminster, it will be largely due to the Labour Party’s refusal to reform the UK's first-past-the-post voting system. Despite overwhelming public and party support for proportional representation (PR)—with polls showing 60% of the population in favor and a majority of Labour MPs backing it—Keir Starmer's government has upheld the current system for strategic gain. Labour secured 63% of seats in 2024 with only 33.7% of the vote, and Monbiot contends that their resistance to PR now stems from fear that in a fairer system, Labour might lose much of its power, as current Welsh Senedd polling suggests. Meanwhile, Reform UK might exploit the current system to win power on as little as 27% of the vote. Monbiot warns that Labour’s reliance on tactical fear-mongering—urging votes to prevent a Reform victory—is both disingenuous and dangerous. He urges voters to defy these threats and vote for parties they truly support, arguing that only grassroots pressure can bring about electoral justice.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40},"pub_date":1770192037,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/05/dan-thomas-former-tory-london-council-reform-leader-wales","title":"Former Tory head of London council appointed Reform leader in Wales","snippet":"Dan Thomas, the former Conservative leader of Barnet Council in London, has been appointed as Reform UK’s new leader in Wales by Nigel Farage, just three months ahead of the Senedd elections. Thomas, who defected from the Conservatives in 2025 after Labour took control of Barnet, recently moved back to his hometown of Blackwood in south Wales. Farage introduced Thomas at a rally near Newport, emphasizing his leadership experience and personal connection to Wales. The appointment marks an effort to revitalize Reform UK's Welsh arm after previous leader Nathan Gill was jailed for bribery.\n\nJames Evans, a former Conservative Senedd member, also defected to Reform UK, increasing the party's representation in the Senedd to two members. Though recent polls show a slight drop in support (from 29% to 23%), Reform still has the potential to make major gains, possibly securing 23 seats. Farage stated that Thomas would have full autonomy on Welsh policy and hinted at a forthcoming manifesto, with pledges such as reversing the Welsh government’s 20mph speed limit and reviving coal mines and steel production, despite skepticism over feasibility. Reform will field nearly 100 candidates under the new constituency structure.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41},"pub_date":1770297979,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/12/reform-uk-labour-britains-membership-politics","title":"Reform UK claims it has overtaken Labour as Britain's ...","snippet":"12 Dec 2025 — Nigel Farage's party says it has more than 268000 members amid reports Labour membership has fallen below 250000.","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9},"pub_date":1765563051,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/aug/16/nigel-farage-revealed-to-be-uks-highest-earning-mp","title":"Nigel Farage revealed to be UK's highest-earning MP","snippet":"16 Aug 2024 — In the first register of interests of the new parliament, the Reform UK MP declared that he was earning £97,900 a month as a presenter for GB ...Read more","ref_id":{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10},"pub_date":1723836091,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.facebook.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/729045084938657/posts/1322222528954240/","title":"Nigel Farage's GB News is officially getting more views ...","snippet":"BREAKING: Nigel Farage's GB News is officially getting more views than both Sky News and BBC news!

Not “what’s in his bank / balance sheet”, but “what’s the market value of having Farage in your corner / on your channel / at the head of a movement” — influence as an asset.\n\nYou can actually rough this in three ways that don’t require mind-reading.\n\n### 1) Price the attention\nHe’s already priced, because people literally pay him for it.\n\nHe was declaring about **£97,900/month from GB News** in 2024. citeturn0search10  \nParliament later published a rectification listing individual GB News payments (tens of thousands per month). citeturn0search6\n\nThat’s not his “worth”, but it tells you the going rate for “Farage on screen” in a fairly constrained market (UK news TV). If you assume that’s not charity but ROI-driven, the implied value of his attention is at least “high six figures to low seven figures per year” to a single outlet.\n\nAlso: GB News itself is still loss-making (big losses reported for year to 31 May 2024), which hints the bet isn’t immediate profit; it’s positioning and influence. citeturn0search8\n\n### 2) Price the political machine\nReform UK’s 2024 election result is a clean signal: **4.1m votes (14.3%) and five seats**, becoming third by vote share. citeturn0search5turn0search3  \nMembership claims around late 2025 were **~268k**. citeturn0search9\n\nThat’s a large, mobilisable base: votes, volunteers, small donations, candidate slates, pressure on the agenda, and — crucially — leverage over the Conservatives’ future direction. If you’re valuing “control”, this is the part: he can move blocs and force bargains.\n\n### 3) Price the agenda control\nInfluence value isn’t just “views” or “votes”, it’s “how much of the national conversation he can drag onto his terrain”. GB News audience metrics are messy, but even the rough numbers show a persistent niche with high dwell time, and claims of leading news-channel averages in late 2025. citeturn0search4\n\nIf you want a usable “casual worth” framing:\n- **Media asset:** worth roughly “a top political presenter + a guaranteed audience segment”, already priced around £1m/year give or take. citeturn0search10turn0search6  \n- **Political asset:** worth “a vote-splitting / vote-moving machine” that can win seats and threaten majorities — and that leverage is worth vastly more than the salary line, because it changes other people’s behaviour (policy shifts, candidate selection, coalitions). citeturn0search5turn0search3  \n- **Network asset:** being useful to very rich patrons doesn’t mean he personally holds £50m, but it does mean his *influence* can be “rented” via funding, platforms, underwriting, and access. (That’s the model.)\n\nIf you want to put a number on “influence worth” without pretending it’s a bank balance, the least-bullshit route is: **treat him like a hybrid of a media property and a political party leader**, then value the media side from what he’s paid, and the political side from what it costs opponents to neutralise him (policy concessions + campaign spend + structural reshaping). That can easily be “tens of millions per year of effective leverage” while his personal wealth remains far lower.\n\nIf you tell me whether you want the number in “£ per year of leverage” or a one-off “capitalised value” (like a purchase price), I’ll quant it with explicit assumptions and keep every step tied to something observable."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"citeturn0search10","start_idx":432,"end_idx":452,"safe_urls":["https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/aug/16/nigel-farage-revealed-to-be-uks-highest-earning-mp","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/aug/16/nigel-farage-revealed-to-be-uks-highest-earning-mp?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The
