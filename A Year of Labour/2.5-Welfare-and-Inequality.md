# Two-Child Limit in Family Benefits — retained, with repeal bill introduced
[status: administrative+bill-in-train] [lead: DWP/HMT] [start: 2017; update 2026-01] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Maintain the existing rule that limits support to the first two children in most low‑income families (as a cost‑control measure), while also putting a removal proposal into Parliament that would end the cap if it passes. [^hoclib-2child-2025; ^uc-twochild-bill-2026]

**Mechanism(s):** Rule remains in Child Tax Credit and the child elements of Universal Credit; a bill has been introduced to repeal/modify the two‑child limit within Universal Credit (with operational detail depending on commencement rules and any transitional arrangements). [^dwp-guidance-2025; ^uc-twochild-bill-2026]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: welfare] [horizon: short] Around 1.6–1.7 million children are in families affected, raising measured child poverty particularly for larger families. [^rf-childpoverty-2025]
- [impact-proven] [area: welfare] [horizon: short] Retention prevents large upfront Exchequer cost but deepens poverty for affected households. [^ifs-brief-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: welfare] [horizon: medium] A bill to remove the two‑child limit has been introduced, but the rule remains in force unless and until legislation passes. [^uc-twochild-bill-2026; ^hoclib-2child-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Retention avoids several £ billions of additional annual spend relative to repeal; removing the limit would create a material recurring fiscal cost (subject to final scope and commencement). [^ifs-brief-2025; ^uc-twochild-bill-2026]

**Distributional effects:** Concentrated losses for low‑income families with three or more children; strongest poverty impact in some regions and minority communities. [^rf-childpoverty-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: finance][risk: political] Fiscal headroom trade‑offs; sustained criticism from anti‑poverty groups; [risk: data-gap] need for up‑to‑date cohort impact estimates and clarity on transitional/backdating decisions if repeal proceeds. [^cpag-2025; ^uc-twochild-bill-2026]

**Timeline & milestones:** Maintained through 2024–25; repeal bill introduced Jan 2026; timing depends on parliamentary passage and commencement. [^uc-twochild-bill-2026; ^hoclib-2child-2025]

**Outcome score:** 1 — Two‑child limit repeal is at least on a legislative track.

# Universal Credit (Adjustment) Act — Base Rate Up, Health Element Rebalanced
[status: enacted] [lead: HMT/DWP] [start: 2025-03] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Raise the basic Universal Credit amount for everyone, while changing the extra disability‑related top‑up for new claims to focus higher support on those with the most severe, long‑term conditions. [^dwp-uc-adjust-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Primary legislation; commencement from April 2026 for new health‑related claims; transitional protections for existing claimants with severe or lifelong conditions. [^dwp-equality-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: welfare] [horizon: short] Basic UC standard allowance increased above previous path. [^budget-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: welfare] [horizon: medium] New health element around half the previous rate for most new claims, with protections for the severest cases. [^dwp-uc-adjust-2025]
- [unknown] Employment effects for people with fluctuating conditions; monitoring required. [^ifs-uc-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Net savings by 2029–30 versus previous policy due to health element changes; part‑recycled into employment support offers. [^obr-costings-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Many without disabilities gain from higher base rate; future new disabled claimants with moderate needs receive less than before; those with the highest needs protected. [^dwp-equality-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Complexity of assessments and transitions; [risk: political] perceived cuts for some new claimants. [^ifs-uc-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Royal Assent 2025; April 2026 start for new health‑related claims; independent PIP review to inform future alignment. [^dwp-uc-adjust-2025]

**Outcome score:** 0 — Balanced: higher base support vs reduced future top‑ups for some disabled newcomers.

# Personal Independence Payment (PIP) — Reform Paused and Independent Review
[status: programme] [lead: DWP] [start: 2025-07] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Pause proposed changes to PIP after late‑stage concessions to avoid defeat, and commission an independent review to improve assessments and support for disabled people. [^guardian-pip-2025; ^dwp-pip-review-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Removal of a contentious eligibility clause from the bill; commissioning of an independent review; continued backlog management and scheduled reassessments; government response to follow. [^hoclib-pip-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: welfare] [horizon: short] Concessions secured passage; existing PIP claimants are protected from immediate changes. [^guardian-pip-2025; ^dwp-pip-review-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: welfare] [horizon: medium] The review is expected to recommend improvements to assessments and support. [^hoclib-pip-2025]
- [unknown] Final shape, timing and fiscal impacts of any future reform. [^ifs-pip-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Neutral in 2025–26 versus the prior proposal; future costs depend on review outcomes and subsequent legislation. [^obr-costings-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Certainty for current claimants; uncertainty for prospective/new claimants until the review concludes and the government responds. [^dwp-pip-review-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: political] Managing expectations across disability groups and fiscal constraints; [risk: delivery] assessment capacity and appeals handling. [^ifs-pip-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** July 2025 concessions; review commissioned in 2025; government response due in 2026. [^guardian-pip-2025; ^dwp-pip-review-2025]

**Outcome score:** -1 — Right call to avoid defeat; impact depends on the review and follow‑through. Scored down primarily for upset, rather than outcomes.

# Public Authorities (Fraud, Error and Recovery) Act 2025
[status: enacted] [lead: Cabinet Office/DWP/HMRC] [start: 2025-12] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Strengthen how public bodies prevent, detect and recover fraud and error involving public money, while setting out safeguards for legitimate claimants. [^pa-fer-act-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Primary legislation extending recovery and information-gathering powers across public authorities (with operational impact depending on codes of practice, data-sharing arrangements and oversight). [^pa-fer-act-2025; ^pa-fer-bill-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-likely] [area: welfare] [horizon: medium] Stronger recovery powers may increase overpayment recovery and deterrence, reducing losses to the Exchequer. [^pa-fer-act-2025]
- [unknown] Risks of incorrect recovery and administrative burden for vulnerable households unless safeguards and appeal routes are strong. [^pa-fer-act-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Implementation and compliance costs for departments; expected savings depend on fraud/error baseline and enforcement effectiveness. [^pa-fer-act-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Potentially higher pressure on low‑income households if recovery is aggressive; benefits from reduced fraud accrue broadly via fiscal sustainability. [^pa-fer-act-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery][risk: rights] Data-quality issues; wrongful recovery; public trust impacts; need for clear oversight. [^pa-fer-act-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Royal Assent Dec 2025; secondary guidance/codes and staged implementation through 2026. [^pa-fer-act-2025]

**Outcome score:** 0 — Valuable integrity tool if safeguards are robust; risk is harm from errors and heavy-handed recovery.

# Universal Credit Administration — Debt Deductions and Reassessments
[status: administrative] [lead: DWP] [start: 2025-04] [horizon: short]

**Intent (plain language):** Make Universal Credit debt deductions gentler and restart more regular benefit reassessments to keep awards up to date. [^dwp-admin-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Guidance and regulations: cap most automatic deductions from benefits (e.g., repayments) to a lower weekly amount; target reassessments where conditions may change; expand work‑coach support. [^dwp-admin-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: welfare] [horizon: short] Lower deduction caps leave more cash each month for hundreds of thousands of households. [^dwp-stats-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: labour-market] [horizon: medium] More timely reassessments reduce error and support return‑to‑work where possible. [^nao-welfare-2025]
- [unknown] Operational capacity for reassessments; appeals volume. [^hoclib-welfare-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Small near‑term Exchequer cost from slower debt recovery; potential savings from reduced overpayment and better targeting. [^obr-costings-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Helps the lowest‑income UC claimants who were experiencing high deductions; improves accuracy across the caseload. [^dwp-stats-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Backlogs; [risk: legal] appeal risk on reassessment outcomes. [^nao-welfare-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Cap implemented April 2025; phased reassessment restart through 2025–26. [^dwp-admin-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Practical cash‑flow relief with manageable delivery risks.

# National Insurance Contributions (Employer Pensions Contributions) Bill (introduced)
[status: bill-in-train] [lead: HMT/HMRC] [start: 2025-12] [horizon: short]

**Intent (plain language):** Change the rules governing employer National Insurance contributions in relation to workplace pension contributions (exact effect depends on the bill’s final provisions). [^nic-employer-pensions-bill-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Primary legislation via a Finance-style bill route, with HMRC implementation and employer payroll system changes as required. [^nic-employer-pensions-bill-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-likely] [area: economy] [horizon: short] Any increase in employer NIC costs could be passed through via wages, hiring, or pension contribution decisions. [^nic-employer-pensions-bill-2025]
- [unknown] Distributional impacts across sectors and firm sizes until the bill text and costings are fully assessed in the dataset. [^nic-employer-pensions-bill-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Employer compliance costs and payroll changes; Exchequer effects depend on scope and behavioural response. [^nic-employer-pensions-bill-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Potentially concentrated in sectors with high pension participation; potential downstream effects on take-home pay and pension generosity. [^nic-employer-pensions-bill-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery][risk: political] Complexity for payroll software; political sensitivity if framed as a “jobs tax” or pension penalty. [^nic-employer-pensions-bill-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Bill introduced Dec 2025; commencement date depends on passage and implementation lead time for employers/software. [^nic-employer-pensions-bill-2025]

**Outcome score:** 0 — Could raise revenue or reshape incentives, but policy value depends on design and mitigations.

# Free School Meals — Expansion to All Families on Universal Credit
[status: administrative] [lead: DfE] [start: 2024-09] [horizon: short]

**Intent (plain language):** Give every child in a family receiving Universal Credit a free school lunch, to reduce hunger and help with the cost of living. [^dfe-fsm-2024]

**Mechanism(s):** National eligibility change; funding provided to schools and local authorities to meet higher demand. [^hm-treasury-2024]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: education] [horizon: short] Hundreds of thousands more children now receive a meal each school day. [^dfe-fsm-2024]
- [impact-likely] [area: welfare] [horizon: medium] Improves attendance and concentration; saves families ~£500 per child per year. [^eef-fsm-2020]
- [unknown] Long‑run attainment impacts for cohorts newly eligible. [^eef-fsm-2020]

**Costs & funding:** Additional central funding; partly covered by revenue from VAT on private school fees. [^fsm-budget-2024]

**Distributional effects:** Benefits lowest‑income families most; helps areas with high deprivation. [^dfe-fsm-2024]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Catering capacity in some schools; [risk: data-gap] take‑up rates tracking. [^nao-education-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Implemented from September 2024; monitoring reports from 2025. [^dfe-fsm-2024]

**Outcome score:** +2 — Targeted help with clear daily benefits for children and families.

# Primary School Free Breakfast Clubs — National Rollout
[status: programme] [lead: DfE] [start: 2025-04] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Offer a free, healthy breakfast before lessons in every primary school, to help children learn and to support working parents. [^dfe-breakfast-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Grants to schools; phased rollout prioritising disadvantaged areas; national guidance on menus and staffing. [^dfe-breakfast-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: education] [horizon: short] Millions of breakfasts served in first terms; strong take‑up in target areas. [^dfe-breakfast-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: welfare] [horizon: medium] Better punctuality and focus in class; childcare support (time buffer) for parents. [^eef-breakfast-2016]
- [unknown] Long‑term attainment changes and health outcomes. [^eef-breakfast-2016]

**Costs & funding:** Dedicated DfE budget line; typical school grant around tens of thousands per year depending on size and uptake. [^dfe-breakfast-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Universal within participating primaries, but most valuable in low‑income communities. [^dfe-breakfast-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Staffing and space constraints in some schools; [risk: finance] sustained funding across years. [^nao-education-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Early adopters April 2025; next wave September 2025; full coverage targeted by 2027. [^dfe-breakfast-2025]

**Outcome score:** +2 — Practical, universal service with strong early signals.

# Winter Fuel Payment — Cut, Backlash and Targeted Reversal
[status: administrative] [lead: HMT/DWP] [start: 2024-07; revised 2025-06] [horizon: short]

**Intent (plain language):** Originally cut the Winter Fuel Payment to focus on the poorest pensioners; then partially reversed to cover most pensioners again after backlash. [^hoclib-wfp-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Means‑testing decision (2024) reduced eligible pensioners; 2025 change raised the income threshold to around £35,000 so about 9 million receive it again. [^hmt-wfp-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: welfare] [horizon: short] 2024/25 winter saw a sharp drop in recipients; 2025/26 restores most coverage with continued exclusion of highest‑income pensioners. [^hoclib-wfp-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: welfare] [horizon: short] Net fiscal effect: one winter of savings, then higher ongoing costs vs the 2024 cut. [^ifs-wfp-2025]
- [unknown] Longer‑term policy direction for universal vs targeted pensioner support. [^hoclib-wfp-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Reversal costs roughly £1.25bn per year (England/Wales), funded within tight budgets. [^hmt-wfp-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Temporary hardship risk in 2024/25 winter for near‑threshold households; restoration improves coverage while excluding the best‑off. [^ifs-wfp-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: political] Optics of U‑turn; [risk: fiscal] pressure on other budgets. [^ifs-wfp-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Means‑test announced July 2024; reversal announced June 2025 for winter 2025/26 onward. [^hoclib-wfp-2025]

**Outcome score:** −1 — Poorly sequenced; reversal limits harm but adds fiscal pressure.

# Warm Home Discount — Continuation and Targeting
[status: administrative] [lead: DESNZ/DWP] [start: annual] [horizon: short]

**Intent (plain language):** Provide a one‑off bill credit to low‑income households’ electricity accounts during winter. [^desnz-whd-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Supplier‑delivered discount for eligible customers, with data‑matching to identify low‑income, high‑cost homes. [^desnz-whd-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: welfare] [horizon: short] Millions receive a £150 bill credit each winter. [^desnz-whd-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: welfare] [horizon: short] Helps avoid arrears and disconnections; complements broader energy support. [^nao-energy-2024]
- [unknown] Targeting precision under new data rules; overlap with local schemes. [^desnz-whd-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Scheme costs recovered via supplier obligations and set‑aside budgets. [^desnz-whd-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Benefits low‑income and high‑energy‑cost households, including many older people and disabled people. [^nao-energy-2024]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Data‑matching errors; [risk: policy] energy price volatility. [^nao-energy-2024]

**Timeline & milestones:** Annual winter cycles; rules refreshed periodically. [^desnz-whd-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Simple, proven support that cushions winter bills.
