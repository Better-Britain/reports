# Introduction

Better Britain's 'Year of Labour' report looks at what the Labour government has done since the July 2024 election and what it means for real people. We aim to be clear, fair and pragmatic. The focus is on real policies and delivery, as they ran and won on a 'change' platform, so we wanted to evaluate that as reasonably as we can.

Each policy is written up in a short, readable format with a score from −2 to +2. The score is a simple way to show whether early signs are positive, negative or unclear. It can change as new evidence arrives. Claims provide citation links to sources.

Aside from specific policy reviews, we have a general section for errors and oversights, as even without directly affecting policy, optics or related issues can have knock-on effects on the confidence of voters and project stakeholders, like house-builders or business leaders.

## Why this report?

This was prepared as a reaction to the general level of 'discourse', both online and offline, mainly on the basis that the previous era’s "ever‑crisis" governing style may have shaped not just how we read the news, but how the news is written in the first place. Headlines do not always reflect what is really happening, so we tried to look beyond them to the real underlying changes. Where we can, we check the facts: what was promised, what was delivered so far, who is affected, and what happens next.

If you want to understand how we score and tag items, see [Methodology](#methodology-scoring-taxonomy). To dive into the policies, see the [policy catalogue](#21-energy-climate-and-nuclear).

The report closes with a [brief Conclusion](#30-conclusions), [Glossary](#51-glossary-and-abbreviations) and [Known Issues](#53-known-issues). The original report included further study of "Who Did What, and When" as a network of major decision-makers, and companion explainers for some of the more complex or controversial issues, but they've been postponed to follow-on reports, [Subscribe via RSS](/feed.xml) or [Better Britain social media](https://bsky.app/profile/betterbritain.bsky.social) to read more when we publish.
