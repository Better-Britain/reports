# Introduction

Better Britain's 'Year of Labour' report looks at what the Labour government has done since the July 2024 election and what it means for Britain. We aim to be clear, fair and pragmatic. The focus is on real policies and delivery, as they ran and won on a 'change' platform, so we wanted to evaluate that as reasonably as we can.

Each policy is written up in a short, readable format with a score from −2 to +2. The score is a simple way to show whether early signs are positive, negative or unclear. It can change as new evidence arrives. Claims provide citation links to sources.

Aside from specific policy reviews, we have a general section for errors and oversights, as even without directly affecting policy, optics or related issues can have knock-on effects on the confidence of voters and project stakeholders, like house-builders or business leaders.

## Latest update (13 Feb 2026)

This report was last updated to 13 February 2026. 

In this refresh we added and updated big-ticket items like: clean energy delivery (early Great British Energy roll‑out, new community energy funding, renewables auction results, and the push to speed up grid connections), the government’s direction on water reform, major housing and planning changes (including renters’ rights and planning reforms), new workplace rights and enforcement plans, migration and asylum changes, justice (sentencing reform), and digital rules (digital ID standards and Online Safety enforcement). We also updated the wider “money and rules” backdrop — the Budget and Finance Bill, plus the UK’s planned carbon border tax — and a small number of governance/media events where they could affect delivery.

Labour's score took a small hit (0.72 to 0.69), mainly from drama (lots more resignations). New policies in general have longer horizons, but a few early policies suggest slow progress.

## Why this matters

This report was prepared as a reaction to the general level of 'discourse', both online and offline, mainly on the basis that the previous era’s "ever‑crisis" governing style may have shaped not just how we read the news, but how the news is written in the first place. Headlines do not always reflect what is really happening, so we tried to look beyond them to the real underlying policies.

If you want to understand how we score and tag items, see [Approach](#approach). To dive into the policies, see the [policy catalogue](#21-energy-climate-and-nuclear).

The report closes with a [brief Conclusion](#20-conclusions), [Glossary](#51-glossary-and-abbreviations) and [Known Issues](#53-known-issues).
