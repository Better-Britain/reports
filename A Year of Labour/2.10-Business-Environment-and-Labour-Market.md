# 2.10 — Business Environment and Labour Market

Scope: The business-facing reforms that shape how easy it is to run a company in the UK — especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), sole traders, and contractors.

## Policy Group Notes

- Cash‑flow: The late‑payments law (card 1) is the fast lever; it works best if the Small Business Commissioner uses new audit and fine powers from day one.
- Cost base: NLW uplifts (card 5) increase wage bills but are partly offset by the Employment Allowance and rates relief; this cushion is most valuable for micro‑businesses.
- Compliance: Digital filing (card 3) modernises records but adds recurring software/agent costs for the smallest firms; regulatory simplification (card 6) should be targeted to claw back some of this time and money.
- Finance: Where cash is still tight, the British Business Bank and Start Up Loans (card 2) give founders and small firms practical routes to capital.
- Worker security: The Employment Rights Bill (card 4) changes scheduling and dismissal rules; phased guidance can reduce friction for very small employers (link to regulator toolkits and standard contracts).

# Late Payments Reform ("Time to Pay Up")
[status: bill-in-train] [lead: Department for Business and Trade (DBT) / Small Business Commissioner (SBC)] [start: 2025-07] [horizon: short]

**Intent (plain language):** Stop big firms paying small suppliers months late. Get cash moving on time so SMEs don’t need to act like banks for their customers. [^dbt-latepay-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Primary legislation; legal cap on payment terms (targeting 60 days then 45 days); mandatory interest on late invoices; new SBC powers to audit payment practices and fine repeat offenders; annual board‑level reporting of payment performance; stronger government prompt‑payment rules in public procurement. [^ppn-reform-2025] [^sbc-ops-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-likely] [area: business] [horizon: short] Tighter terms could reduce average days‑to‑pay and cut overdue receivables for SMEs by a material margin. [^fsb-brief-2025]
- [impact-hypothetical] [area: economy] [horizon: medium] Culture change and enforcement could unlock billions in working capital across supply chains. [^bbr-ia-2025]
- [unknown] Real‑world deterrence depends on early, visible fines and closing “disputed invoice” loopholes. [^nao-oversight-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Compliance and reporting costs for large firms; set‑up and running costs for SBC enforcement (publicly funded). [^dbt-ia-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Benefits micro‑businesses and SMEs (better cash flow, fewer insolvencies); limited direct effect for consumers. [^fsb-brief-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery][risk: political] If audits and penalties are slow, behaviour may snap back; some firms may rebadge invoices as “in dispute.” [^sbc-ops-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Bill passage; SBC guidance published within months; first test audits and penalties within 6–12 months of commencement. [^dbt-latepay-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — High‑potential SME support; success hinges on visible, consistent enforcement.

# Small Business Finance Boost (British Business Bank & Start Up Loans)
[status: programme] [lead: HM Treasury (HMT) / DBT / British Business Bank (BBB)] [start: 2025-07] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Make it easier for founders and small firms to get affordable finance to start, grow, and invest — especially outside London and the South East. [^bbb-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Expansion of Start Up Loans (government‑backed, low‑interest loans for new businesses); larger guarantee capacity for the British Business Bank’s schemes that share risk with lenders; regional investment funds. [^startuploans-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: business] [horizon: short] Additional loan tranches and guarantee headroom increase the number of SMEs funded. [^bbb-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: economy] [horizon: medium] Better access to finance supports survival and growth of young firms in weaker local credit markets. [^bbb-2025]
- [unknown] Take‑up can lag without outreach and templates for very small firms with limited collateral. [^nao-sme-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Exchequer cost is mainly guarantee fees and expected losses; benefits include higher business formation and investment. [^hmt-ia-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Stronger impact for regions with historically tight lending; boosts first‑time and under‑represented founders. [^bbb-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: finance] Credit risk in downturns; administrative burden may deter the smallest traders. [^nao-sme-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** New funding windows open in 2025/26; regional funds scale over 2026. [^bbb-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Practical help where bank lending is scarce; delivery depends on lender participation and founder awareness.

# Companies House & HMRC Filing Changes (Software‑only, CATO closure, MTD expansion)
[status: administrative/secondary] [lead: Companies House / HMRC / HMT] [start: 2025-03 (notice); 2026-04 (effective for CATO closure)] [horizon: short]

**Intent (plain language):** Digitise company accounts and tax returns, reduce error and fraud, and close the tax gap — but at the cost of new software and admin for the small businesses. [^companieshouse-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Mandated software filing at Companies House; closure of HMRC’s free Company Accounts and Tax Online (CATO) service from April 2026; “Making Tax Digital” (MTD) for Income Tax extended to more sole traders/landlords in phases (thresholds stepping down to ~£20k by 2028); tougher late‑filing penalties; stronger HMRC enforcement. [^cato-notice-2025] [^hmrc-mtd-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: business] [horizon: short] Removal of free filing channels means many micro‑companies must buy software or hire accountants. [^companieshouse-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: economy] [horizon: medium] Digital records can reduce errors and speed up compliance checks. [^hmrc-mtd-2025]
- [unknown] Net effect on business formation and self‑employment given added costs/time. [^ifs-mtd-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Ongoing software subscriptions and accountancy fees for very small entities; HMRC and Companies House bear platform and enforcement costs. [^hmrc-mtd-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Disproportionate burden on sole traders, “one‑person companies,” and low‑turnover landlords; negligible impact on large corporates already digital. [^ifs-mtd-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery][risk: data-gap] Digital exclusion and rollout complexity may require phasing/deferrals; clarity needed on micro‑entity exemptions. [^hmrc-mtd-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** 2025 guidance; CATO closes 2026‑04; MTD phases in 2026/27/28; penalty regime already tightened. [^cato-notice-2025]

**Outcome score:** −1 — Modernisation has benefits, but raises costs and admin for the smallest firms unless mitigations land well. Postponed for businesses under £10m

# Employment Rights Bill (Day‑one rights, zero‑hours curbs, fire‑and‑rehire)
[status: bill-in-train] [lead: DBT / Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)] [start: 2025-02] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Improve job security and predictability — especially for people on zero‑hours or precarious contracts — while keeping clear routes to hire flexibly. [^employment-rights-bill-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Primary legislation to phase in day‑one protection against unfair dismissal; curb “fire‑and‑rehire” misuse; require reasonable notice, compensation for cancelled shifts, and contracts that reflect actual hours worked; stronger sick/parental/flexible work rights; updated codes of practice; tribunal and enforcement tweaks. [^employment-rights-bill-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-likely] [area: labour-market] [horizon: medium] Around one million workers could see more predictable hours and income. [^employment-rights-ia-2025]
- [impact-hypothetical] [area: economy] [horizon: medium] Better security may aid productivity and retention, offsetting some employer cost. [^employment-rights-ia-2025]
- [unknown] Business adaptation costs and the effect on very small employers until secondary rules are final. [^dbt-ia-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Compliance and potential staffing cost increases for some employers; minimal direct Exchequer cost beyond enforcement. [^employment-rights-ia-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Gains for low‑paid and shift‑based workers; costs concentrated in sectors with variable demand (hospitality, retail, care). [^employment-rights-ia-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Complex phasing and sector variation; risk of fewer entry‑level opportunities if poorly implemented. [^employment-rights-ia-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Bill passage expected 2025; main provisions commence from 2026–27 following consultation and guidance. [^employment-rights-bill-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Sensible protections if phased well; watch administrative load on micro‑employers.

# National Living Wage (NLW) Uplift and Small‑Employer Offsets
[status: enacted] [lead: HMT / DBT] [start: 2025-04] [horizon: short]

**Intent (plain language):** Raise the wage floor for lower‑paid workers, while cushioning the impact on small employers through tax and rate reliefs. [^nlw-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** NLW increased (toward two‑thirds of median pay); Employment Allowance raised (cuts employer National Insurance bills for small firms); temporary 75% business‑rates relief continued for retail, hospitality and leisure; limited support for very small employers on auto‑enrolment pension changes. [^employment-allowance-2025] [^rates-relief-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: labour-market] [horizon: short] Millions of workers see pay rises; many micro‑employers pay less in National Insurance due to the allowance increase. [^nlw-2025]
- [impact-hypothetical] [area: economy] [horizon: short] Net employment effects depend on margins and demand; offsets aim to prevent job losses. [^ifs-nlw-2025]
- [unknown] Price pass‑through for consumer‑facing sectors; effect on firm survival in weak local markets. [^ifs-nlw-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Fiscal cost via the Employment Allowance and business‑rates relief; potential revenue effects from slower profit growth. [^hmt-budget-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Clear gains for low‑paid workers; relief targeted at the smallest and most exposed sectors. [^hmt-budget-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: finance] Thin‑margin firms may still struggle where demand is weak or rents are high. [^ons-sector-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** NLW/allowance changes from April 2025; rates relief through 2025/26; review in the next Budget. [^hmt-budget-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Material boost to low pay with sensible cushions for micro‑firms; monitor closures in high‑cost areas.

# Agricultural Property Relief Cap (Inheritance Tax Reform)
[status: enacted] [lead: HMT/DEFRA] [start: 2024-10] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Increase tax fairness by capping Agricultural Property Relief (APR) so very large estates pay some inheritance tax, while typical family farms remain protected. [^gov-apr-2024]

**Mechanism(s):** Finance Act changes from April 2026: 100% relief on first £1m of qualifying agricultural/business property per estate (effectively £2m for a couple); 50% relief above that; option to pay over 10 years. [^gov-apr-2024]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: fiscal] Raises revenue mainly from the largest estates; small/mid farms broadly shielded. [^gov-apr-2024]
- [impact-likely] [area: rural] Sector concern about liquidity and investment; politics sensitive. [^guardian-farmers-2024]
- [unknown] Land sales/valuation effects and corporate consolidation risks. [^guardian-farmers-2024]

**Costs & funding:** Administrative costs for HMRC; expected revenue increase by 2030. [^gov-apr-2024]

**Distributional effects:** Higher liabilities for very large estates; little change for typical family farms; possible opportunities for new entrants if land circulates. [^guardian-farmers-2024]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: political] rural backlash; [risk: market] timing effects on land prices; [risk: compliance] avoidance/loopholes. [^guardian-farmers-2024]

**Timeline & milestones:** Oct 2024 announcement; Finance Act 2024; in force Apr 2026; monitor first probate cases 2026–27. [^gov-apr-2024]

**Outcome score:** 0 — Fairer in principle; delivery optics and rural impacts to watch.

# Regulatory Simplification for Small Firms (targeted red‑tape cuts)
[status: programme] [lead: Cabinet Office / DBT / DSIT] [start: 2024-11] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Reduce paperwork that adds little value for small businesses, while keeping real consumer and safety protections. [^reul-review-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** “One‑in‑two‑out” approach for SME‑targeted rules; raising thresholds (e.g., for some reporting duties); simpler data protection checklists for firms under ~50 employees; pruning legacy requirements with low safety value; guidance to regulators on proportionate enforcement. [^co-betterreg-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-likely] [area: business] [horizon: medium] Aggregate admin‑time savings across hundreds of thousands of small firms. [^reul-review-2025]
- [impact-hypothetical] [area: economy] [horizon: medium] Frees up owner time for sales and operations rather than paperwork. [^reul-review-2025]
- [unknown] Quality impacts if thresholds are set too high or rules over‑pruned. [^ncc-consumer-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Minor guidance and transition costs for regulators; small implementation costs for firms adjusting to new templates. [^co-betterreg-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Savings skew to micro‑businesses and the self‑employed, who spend the most time on admin per £ of turnover. [^ifs-sme-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: legal][risk: political] Risk of challenge if changes weaken consumer or worker protections; need to keep regulators aligned. [^ncc-consumer-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Ongoing review in 2024/25; staged guidance and secondary legislation through 2025/26. [^reul-review-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Helpful if kept focused on genuine overheads; avoid cutting protections by accident.

# UK–India Free Trade Agreement (FTA)
[status: enacted] [lead: DBT/FCDO] [start: 2025-05 (negotiations concluded); signed 2025-07] [horizon: long]

**Intent (plain language):** Boost growth and ties through a comprehensive trade deal cutting tariffs and easing access for goods and some services between the UK and India. [^guardian-ukindia-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Bilateral treaty (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement); staged tariff reductions; committees to oversee implementation; ratification by both parliaments. [^wiki-ukindia-fta]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: economy] Tariffs cut on most UK exports; projected GDP gains over time. [^guardian-ukindia-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: diplomacy] Deeper UK–India partnership beyond trade (tech, education, security). [^guardian-ukindia-2025]
- [unknown] Limited services access may cap benefits; sectoral winners/losers. [^guardian-ukindia-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Implementation costs for promotion and customs systems; tariff revenue changes; adjustment pressures in sensitive sectors. [^guardian-ukindia-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Gains for exporters (e.g., machinery, whisky, pharma) and consumers; pressures for some producers facing new competition. [^guardian-ukindia-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] ratification/implementation pace; [risk: economic] limited services access; [risk: political] standards/human‑rights scrutiny. [^guardian-ukindia-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** May 2025 agreement in principle; Jul 2025 signing; 2026 expected entry into force if ratified. [^guardian-ukindia-2025]

**Outcome score:** +2 — Significant strategic and economic step; uneven sectoral gains.
