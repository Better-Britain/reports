# 2.11 — Justice, Policing and Prisons

Scope: Capacity management; sentencing; victim support; serious/organised crime, protest responses.

## Policy Group Notes 

- Reoffending indicators; custody crowding impacts; community order completion.
- Public safety incidents; transparency and communications.
- Supporting study from BBB incoming on heavy handed, poorly considered police response and decision drivers
- Data gaps: charge rates, court backlogs, legal aid capacity.
- Court and prison backlogs are core drivers of pressure; cutting listing delays reduces inflow and length of stay. [^moj-courts-data-2025]
- Probation capacity and quality are the hinge for early release safety and rehabilitation success. [^hmpps-inspectorate-2025]
- Protest policing consistency relies on clear national guidance, officer training, and transparent post‑event data. [^npcc-guidance-2025]
- Public trust is sensitive to fairness and proportionality; publish arrest/charge/disposal rates and independent reviews. [^hmicfrs-2025]
- Data gaps: charge rates by offence, legal aid capacity, regional reoffending trends; commit to regular open data updates. [^hoclib-justice-2025]
