# 2.9 — Devolution, Local Growth and Transport

Scope: Fiscal devolution; integrated multi‑year settlements; locally controlled buses and joined‑up rail; growth funds; skills alignment.

## Policy Group Notes

- Ridership and punctuality gains from franchising and integrated fares are early signs the model works; track subsidy and value‑for‑money as networks mature. [^gmca-bee-2025]
- The single‑pot funding and recyclable growth funds let regions line up transport with housing, skills and regeneration — speeding delivery and reducing bid‑writing overhead. [^sr-2024]
- Rollout will be uneven: established metros move faster than new county deals; the Bill’s “ladder” aims to close that gap over time. [^hoclib-devolution-2025]
- Rail partnerships must mesh with local franchised buses to make door‑to‑door journeys simple (one ticket, capped prices). [^hoclib-rail-2025]

# English Devolution & Community Empowerment Bill
[status: bill-in-train] [lead: DLUHC/Cabinet Office] [start: 2025-09] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Give every part of England a clear route to a mayor and deeper local powers, without years of bespoke negotiations. Set national rules so places that meet good‑governance tests automatically unlock stronger powers.

**Mechanism(s):** Primary legislation defining tiers of devolution, triggers to move up those tiers, and a backstop for creating combined authorities where local agreement stalls. Simplifies how funding and powers are awarded, replacing one‑off deals. [^hoclib-devolution-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-likely] [area: devolution] [horizon: medium] Bill creates a uniform “ladder” of powers so established mayors can graduate to deeper fiscal and transport powers. [^hoclib-devolution-2025]
- [impact-proven] [area: devolution] [horizon: short] Multiple new devolution deals agreed since July 2024; more areas in formation. [^dluhc-deals-2025]
- [unknown] Timing for county areas to reach “established mayor” status varies with local capacity and consent. [^nao-devolution-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Mainly administrative changes and re‑profiling of existing grants. No large new central spending line is expected at passage. [^sr-2024]

**Distributional effects:** More control for city‑regions and counties; risk of uneven pace if smaller areas lack capacity.

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery][risk: political] Local consent, Whitehall departments aligning on a single model, legal drafting for backstop powers. [^ifg-devolution-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Bill introduced 2025‑09; committee/Report in 2025–26 session; staged commencement through 2026. [^hoclib-devolution-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — A clearer, rules‑based path to devolution; real impact depends on implementation speed.

# Integrated Single‑Pot Settlements (City‑Region Funding)
[status: programme] [lead: HMT/DLUHC/Mayors] [start: 2024-12] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Replace dozens of short‑term grants with a single multi‑year budget for each mayoral area, so local leaders can plan and invest with confidence.

**Mechanism(s):** Treasury and DLUHC agree consolidated five‑year envelopes covering transport, housing, skills and regeneration, with light‑touch reporting on outcomes. [^sr-2024]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: devolution] [horizon: short] First wave of established mayors received integrated settlements, replacing fragmented pots. [^dluhc-trailblazer-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: economy] [horizon: medium] Long‑term budgets bring forward complex schemes (e.g., mass‑transit and brownfield housing). [^ifg-capital-2025]
- [unknown] Value‑for‑money frameworks and local evaluation capacity vary by region. [^nao-investment-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Circa £8.8bn over five years re‑profiled to city‑regions, with freedom to move money within envelopes. [^sr-2024]

**Distributional effects:** Benefits metros first; newer combined authorities may lag until they qualify.

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery][risk: finance] Programme management capacity; inflation risk in construction.

**Timeline & milestones:** SR 2024 allocations confirmed; 2025 settlements live; mid‑term review around year 3. [^sr-2024]

**Outcome score:** +2 — Gives places stable funding to deliver; success hinges on local capacity and project selection.

# Transport Franchising & Local Integration (Buses, Trams, Ticketing)
[status: programme] [lead: DfT/Mayors/Local Transport Authorities] [start: 2024-09] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Put buses back under local control where chosen, coordinate buses, trams and local rail, and introduce simple, capped fares so people can afford reliable public transport.

**Mechanism(s):** Use existing franchising powers to let local authorities plan routes and timetables; integrate fares and ticketing across modes; invest through long‑term city‑region transport settlements. [^ltp-guidance-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: transport] [horizon: short] Greater Manchester completed bus franchising, launched one brand and integrated fares; early data show improved punctuality and rising patronage. [^gmca-bee-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: transport] [horizon: medium] West Yorkshire and other regions are advancing franchising and integrated ticketing, with staged go‑lives from 2026. [^wyca-bus-2025]
- [unknown] Long‑run subsidy needs and operator transition costs vary by network. [^nao-busfranchise-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Funded via city‑region settlements and local budgets; short‑term transition costs offset by better network design and social gains. [^sr-2024]

**Distributional effects:** Bigger benefits for low‑income commuters and areas with poor current provision.

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery][risk: legal][risk: finance] Procurement complexity; potential challenges from incumbents; inflation in operating costs.

**Timeline & milestones:** 2024–25 franchising completion in GM; 2025–27 staged roll‑outs and ticketing integration elsewhere. [^gmca-bee-2025]

**Outcome score:** +2 — Tangible service improvements where implemented; finances must be watched closely.

# Mayoral Growth & Investment Funds (Recyclable)
[status: programme] [lead: HMT/DLUHC/Mayors] [start: 2025-04] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Give mayors a flexible “evergreen” fund to co‑invest in local projects (stations, housing, clean industry) and recycle returns into future schemes.

**Mechanism(s):** Seed capital from central government; local co‑investment; returns recycled; oversight via local audit and outcome dashboards. [^dluhc-growthfund-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-likely] [area: economy] [horizon: medium] Leverages private finance into projects that otherwise struggle to reach financial close. [^bbb-2025]
- [unknown] Portfolio risk and governance maturity differ across regions; performance data will take time. [^nao-localgrowth-2025]

**Costs & funding:** ~£0.5bn national seed across multiple funds; local match expected. [^dluhc-growthfund-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Can target left‑behind places within regions; depends on local selection criteria.

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: finance][risk: delivery] Project appraisal quality; market cycles affecting exits.

**Timeline & milestones:** 2025 setup; first investments announced 2025–26; recycling visible from 2027 onward. [^dluhc-growthfund-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Useful financial tool; outcomes hinge on disciplined project selection.

# Local Skills Compacts (with Skills England)
[status: programme] [lead: DfE/Skills England/Mayors] [start: 2025-03] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Align training places and apprenticeships with local employers’ needs so people can move into good jobs nearby.

**Mechanism(s):** Devolved or pooled skills budgets; regional skills plans co‑signed by mayors, employers and providers; outcome‑based funding pilots. [^dfe-skills-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: skills] [horizon: short] Early compacts redirected funding into high‑demand roles (e.g., green construction, health support) and expanded local apprenticeship cohorts. [^mayor-skills-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: economy] [horizon: medium] Better match reduces vacancies and raises progression. [^lga-skills-2025]
- [unknown] Data‑sharing and provider responsiveness across fragmented markets. [^nao-skills-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Within existing skills envelopes; potential top‑ups via growth funds and employer contributions. [^dfe-skills-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Helps young people and career‑switchers in regions with changing industry mix.

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Provider capacity; employer engagement; measurement of outcomes.

**Timeline & milestones:** 2025 compacts signed in first wave; evaluation and next‑wave rollout 2026. [^dfe-skills-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Sensible alignment; impact depends on execution and employer buy‑in.

# Great British Railways (Regional Partnerships & Rail Integration)
[status: programme] [lead: DfT/Shadow GBR/Mayors] [start: 2025-02] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Create a single guiding mind for rail, work with mayors to join up local rail with buses and trams, and simplify fares.

**Mechanism(s):** Shadow Great British Railways structures; Railways Bill to formalise; partnership agreements with combined authorities on timetables, stations and ticketing. [^hoclib-rail-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-likely] [area: transport] [horizon: medium] Unified planning should improve reliability and make multimodal tickets standard. [^ifg-rail-2025]
- [unknown] Passage timing of the Railways Bill and scope of devolved rail responsibilities. [^hoclib-rail-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Reorganisation costs within DfT/GBR; capital from existing rail budgets; city‑region complements for stations and interchanges. [^dfit-rail-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Better everyday travel for commuters; supports regional growth.

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: legal][risk: delivery] Legislative timetable; alignment of national and local priorities.

**Timeline & milestones:** Shadow GBR operating; Bill passage targeted this session; phased regional partnerships 2025–27. [^hoclib-rail-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Promising system fix; benefits arrive as legislation and partnerships mature.
