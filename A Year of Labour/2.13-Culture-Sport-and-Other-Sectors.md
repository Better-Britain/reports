# 2.13 — Culture, Sport and Other Sectors

Scope: Sectoral regulators and public-interest reforms.

## Policy Group Notes

- How the Court ruling and EHRC enforcement cascade into sector policies (health services, policing, prisons, schools). Encourage joined‑up training and clear public communication to reduce confusion.
- For tobacco and vaping, pair national rules with local enforcement resources so the intended health gains are realised.
- For the football regulator, ensure proportionate rules for lower‑league clubs so compliance costs do not undermine club viability.
