# VAT on Private School Fees and Removal of Rates Relief
[status: enacted] [lead: HM Treasury / Department for Education] [start: 2025-01] [horizon: medium]

**Intent:** Raise money for state education and reduce unfair tax advantages for private (independent) schools by charging Value Added Tax (VAT) on fees and removing business rates relief. [^vat-policy-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Budget measures and secondary legislation: 20% VAT applied to most fees from Jan 2025; charitable business rates relief removed from April 2025. [^vat-legal-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: education] [horizon: short] Private school rolls fell by roughly 1.9% mid‑year (≈10–11k pupils), with dozens of small schools announcing closures/mergers; state capacity absorbed most leavers so far. [^dfe-census-2025; ^isc-tracker-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: education] [horizon: medium] Policy expected to raise ≈£1.7bn per year to fund teachers, free school meals, and breakfast clubs. [^obr-costing-2024]
- [unknown] Localised pressure in already full state schools; uneven effects by region. [^dfe-la-letters-2025]

**Costs & funding:** New revenue recycled to education; transition grants available for local authorities to handle hotspots. [^hmt-alloc-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Benefits the 90%+ of children in state schools; higher costs for some private school families; closure risk concentrated in smaller schools. [^ifs-brief-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Managing intake in oversubscribed areas; [risk: political] public debate on fairness; [risk: data-gap] timely tracking of transfers. [^hoclib-brief-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** VAT in force Jan 2025; rates relief removal from Apr 2025; first full-year outturns in 2025/26. [^vat-legal-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Additional funding for state pupils with manageable system pressures so far.

# RSHE (Relationships, Sex and Health Education) Statutory Guidance 2025
[status: administrative] [lead: Department for Education] [start: 2025-07] [horizon: medium]

**Costs & funding:** No large new grants; relies on fee income and international cohorts; risk of deficits at vulnerable institutions. [^ofs-risk-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Possible subject closures and regional effects where universities are major employers. [^hepi-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: finance] institutional solvency; [risk: political] migration targets vs sector needs. [^ofs-risk-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Annual fee decisions; visa rule updates; OfS monitoring through the year. [^ofs-risk-2025]

**Outcome score:** 0 — Necessary stop‑gap with real trade‑offs and uncertain medium‑term outcomes.
