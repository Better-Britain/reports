# 3.0 â€” Comparative Outcome Matrix (Placeholder)

A cross-cutting matrix view the parser will generate; guidance for logic:

- Rows = Policies (refs to 2.x IDs).
- Cols = Outcome score, Impact class mix, Areas-of-effect, Distributional summary, Key metrics, Risks.
- Instruction: Build sortable table; expose filters by area, score, horizon, dist-group.
- Note: Potential display density challenges; may iterate on prioritisation.
