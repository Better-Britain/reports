# 2.8 — Digital, Data and AI

Scope: Data portability that lets people and small firms share their data safely to save money or get better deals; trusted digital identity to prove who you are online; an institute that tests powerful AI models before they go live; modern product safety for online marketplaces; and the Online Safety Act implementation stance (with a separate deep-dive report linked elsewhere).

## Policy Group Notes

- Measured benefits from pilots (fraud reduction, easier switching, SME finance) should be surfaced in simple, human terms (e.g., “minutes saved,” “£ saved per year”), not just technical metrics. [^dsit-cfe-2025]
- AI testing results should explain the risk in plain English (e.g., “the model could be tricked into explaining harmful steps”), and show what changed after fixes. [^aisi-report-2025]
- Data portability should avoid jargon (“download your data” vs “API access”) and give easy routes for people with lower digital confidence. [^dsit-inclusion-2025]
- Product safety updates should spell out what’s new for shoppers (“marketplaces must remove unsafe goods quickly and keep devices updated”). [^opss-marketplace-2025]

# Data (Use & Access) Act 2025 — Smart Data and Digital Identity
[status: enacted] [lead: DSIT/OfDIA] [start: 2025-06] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Give government the legal tools to switch on “Smart Data” schemes across sectors so people can share their own data (like energy use or telecoms bills) with trusted apps to get a better deal, and put the UK’s digital identity trust framework on a firm legal footing so people can prove who they are online easily and safely. [^dua-act-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Primary legislation that (1) lets ministers create sector-specific Smart Data regulations; (2) establishes a statutory Digital Verification Services regime with a government-run register of certified identity providers (via the Office for Digital Identities and Attributes, OfDIA); and (3) brings other data enablers like the National Underground Asset Register into scope. [^dua-act-2025; ^ofdia-register-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: digital] [horizon: short] Act received Royal Assent; OfDIA preparing the statutory provider register and trust mark. [^dua-act-2025; ^ofdia-register-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: digital] [horizon: medium] First Smart Data schemes (energy/telecoms) expected via secondary rules from 2025–26, building on pilots that cut hassle and fraud. [^dsit-roadmap-2025; ^dsit-cfe-2025]
- [unknown] Final design choices (privacy safeguards, redress, inclusion) will be set in sector regulations; real-world uptake depends on user-friendly services. [^ico-brief-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Setup and oversight costs for government and regulators; compliance costs for firms; expected net savings for households/SMEs from easier switching and lower fraud. [^impact-assess-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Benefits everyday users and small businesses by putting them in control of their data; risk of excluding people without smartphones or formal ID unless inclusion measures are built in. [^dsit-inclusion-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: security][risk: delivery][risk: legal] Getting consent, security and liability right; avoiding vendor lock-in; making data standards interoperable across sectors. [^ncc-tech-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** 2025-06 Royal Assent; late-2025 OfDIA register and trust mark go live; 2026 first sector schemes begin (energy/telecoms). [^dsit-roadmap-2025]

**Outcome score:** +2 — Clear enabler for pro-consumer, pro-competition services if implemented with strong safeguards.

# Smart Data Schemes — Energy, Telecoms and Finance roll-out
[status: programme] [lead: DSIT with Ofgem/Ofcom/FCA] [start: 2024-11] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Turn the new legal powers into practical schemes that let people share their usage and billing data (with permission) to find cheaper tariffs, get fairer deals, and access green or growth finance more easily. [^dsit-smartdata-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Pilots (e.g., “Perseus” linking business smart meter data to banks for green loans), consultations, and then sector regulations that mandate secure data-sharing pipes between companies and certified third parties. A cross-sector Smart Data Group coordinates standards and timing. [^perseus-pilot-2025; ^smartdata-group-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: energy] [horizon: short] Early energy Smart Data services already help hundreds of thousands compare tariffs or plan retrofits, cutting admin time for households and SMEs. [^energy-pilot-stats-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: digital] [horizon: medium] Standardised data access in telecoms and banking expected to reduce bill shock and fraud, and boost competition. [^dsit-cfe-2025]
- [unknown] Real savings depend on consumer uptake, app quality, and regulator enforcement of standards. [^cma-competition-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Integration and compliance costs for providers; expected net benefits through reduced search costs, fewer errors, and better credit decisions. [^impact-assess-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Strong upside for bill-payers and small firms; ensure accessible design for people with low digital confidence. [^dsit-inclusion-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery][risk: security] Interoperability across legacy IT; consistent, secure consent flows; avoiding “dark patterns.” [^ico-brief-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** 2024–25 pilots and consultations; 2026 first mandatory schemes switch on; 2027+ expansion to more sectors. [^dsit-roadmap-2025]

**Outcome score:** +2 — Likely to save money and time at scale if the pipes and protections are done well.

# UK AI Safety/Security Institute — testing models before deployment
[status: programme] [lead: DSIT/AISI] [start: 2024-11] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Test powerful AI models for dangerous capabilities (like helping with cybercrime or bio-harm) before and after they are released, publish methods and results, and set shared standards with partners overseas. [^aisi-report-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Government institute with an expert team that runs standard evaluations, “red team” tests under non-disclosure agreements with labs, and open-sources its testing toolkit (e.g., “Inspect”) so others can replicate checks. Partnerships with peer bodies in the US, EU and Canada. [^inspect-tool-2025; ^aisi-mou-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: ai] [horizon: short] First test reports published; Inspect tool released; at least one frontier model was red-teamed before launch. [^aisi-report-2025; ^inspect-tool-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: ai] [horizon: medium] Pre-deployment testing becomes standard for leading models and informs procurement and safety guidance. [^aisi-progress-2025]
- [unknown] How quickly tests must evolve to keep pace with new model capabilities; how findings translate into enforceable guardrails. [^aisi-progress-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Public funding for staff, secure compute and partnerships; relatively modest compared with the potential costs of unsafe deployment. [^hmt-aispend-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Benefits users and public services by reducing risk; some compliance and disclosure costs for AI developers. [^aisi-report-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery][risk: access] Continuous access to cutting-edge models; staying technically ahead; coordination with international regulators. [^aisi-mou-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** 2024 launch; 2025 first evaluations, tool release, and US/Canada partnerships; 2026 common evaluation baselines agreed with partners. [^aisi-progress-2025]

# Public-Sector Digital Identity — trusted checks for everyday life
[status: programme] [lead: DSIT/OfDIA/Cabinet Office] [start: 2025-06] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Let people prove they are who they say they are online (for example, to rent a flat, verify age, or start a job) using certified apps that meet government standards, without repeatedly scanning paperwork or sharing more data than needed. [^ofdia-register-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Statutory Digital Verification Services: government certifies providers, publishes a register and trust mark, and allows controlled data checks to verify identity attributes (such as age or right to work). Services must be private by default and consent-based. [^dua-act-2025; ^dvf-guidance-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: digital] [horizon: short] The Act moves digital identity into a statutory Digital Verification Services (DVS) regime; the trust framework becomes the baseline for a certification + trust‑mark model that services can build to. [^dua-act-2025; ^dvf-guidance-2025; ^ofdia-register-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: economy] [horizon: medium] Faster, safer onboarding across renting, hiring and payments reduces fraud and admin burden. [^hmt-fraud-2025]
- [unknown] Inclusion and accessibility outcomes; cross-border recognition with other countries’ ID systems. [^ico-brief-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Certification and compliance costs for providers; net savings from reduced document checks and fraud for employers, landlords and users. [^impact-assess-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Convenience gains for most users; ensure offline routes remain for those without smartphones or formal documents. [^dsit-inclusion-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: security][risk: legal] Strong privacy-by-design, clear liability and robust complaint routes are essential to build trust. [^ico-brief-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Late-2025: DVS trust framework becomes the compliance baseline and certification ramps up; register opens and first providers are certified; 2026: wider adoption across renting, age checks and right-to-work flows. [^dvf-guidance-2025; ^ofdia-register-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — High-utility public infrastructure if delivered with strong privacy, reliable tech and inclusive design.

# Cyber Security and Resilience (NIS) Bill — critical infrastructure baseline (introduced)
[status: bill] [lead: DSIT/NCSC] [start: 2025-11] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Raise the baseline level of cyber resilience for essential services and key digital providers, by modernising the UK’s Network and Information Systems (NIS) framework and tightening duties around risk management and incident response. [^nis-bill-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Primary legislation introduced to Parliament to update the UK’s cyber resilience rules for covered sectors, including the scope of who is regulated and what is required (with detailed obligations expected to be clarified through the bill process and follow‑on regulation/guidance). [^nis-bill-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: security] [horizon: short] Bill introduced (status change from “idea” to a live legislative programme). [^nis-bill-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: security] [horizon: medium] Clearer baseline security duties and incident handling should reduce systemic risk from common cyber failures (if enforcement and sector guidance keep pace). [^nis-bill-2025]
- [unknown] Final scope, regulator capacity and interaction with sector-specific cyber rules (e.g., finance, telecoms, energy). [^nis-bill-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Compliance and assurance costs for regulated operators; oversight and enforcement resourcing for regulators. [^nis-bill-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Concentrated burdens on operators in covered sectors; broad benefits if outages and breaches reduce. [^nis-bill-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery][risk: capacity][risk: regulatory] Compliance can degrade into paperwork without clear technical standards and auditability; enforcement must be credible for high-risk operators. [^nis-bill-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** 2025-11 introduced; 2026+ depends on passage, commencement and sector guidance. [^nis-bill-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Sensible “systems plumbing”, but delivery depends on scope, standards and enforcement.

# Product Safety for the Online Age — new powers and duties
[status: enacted] [lead: DBT/OPSS] [start: 2025-07] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Update product safety rules so they clearly cover software and “smart” devices, and make online marketplaces share responsibility for removing dangerous goods. [^prm-act-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Product Regulation & Metrology Act 2025 gives ministers power to update safety rules by regulation; brings software and installers explicitly into scope; requires platforms to cooperate with investigations; and enables new rules like electrical product cybersecurity and update support. [^opss-marketplace-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: consumer] [horizon: short] Act passed; OPSS issued an online marketplace code and has begun coordinated take-downs of unsafe listings. [^opss-marketplace-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: digital] [horizon: medium] Upcoming regulations on connected device safety and security updates should cut fire and hacking risks. [^opss-electrical-2026]
- [unknown] Enforcement capacity against overseas sellers and smaller platforms. [^nao-product-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Compliance investment for platforms/sellers; regulator resourcing for investigations; benefits from fewer injuries and recalls. [^dbt-impact-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Safer consumer goods for everyone; small sellers may face higher compliance costs and need guidance. [^opss-marketplace-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: legal][risk: delivery] Cross-border enforcement and consistency with international standards. [^nao-product-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** 2025 Act in force; 2025–26 marketplace code and guidance; 2026 first specific regulations (e.g., electrical/connected devices). [^opss-electrical-2026]

**Outcome score:** +2 — Brings safety law into line with how people actually shop and use devices.

# Property (Digital Assets etc) Act 2025 — digital assets as personal property
[status: enacted] [lead: MoJ] [start: 2025-12] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Reduce legal uncertainty by confirming that certain digital assets can be treated as personal property, making it easier to apply familiar rules around ownership, transfers and remedies to new forms of value. [^digital-assets-act-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Primary legislation clarifying that a digital asset is not excluded from being “property” just because it is neither a physical thing nor a traditional “thing in action”. This supports courts and practitioners in applying property concepts to digital assets in disputes and transactions. [^digital-assets-act-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: digital] [horizon: short] Act passed, providing a clearer statutory basis for treating digital assets as personal property. [^digital-assets-act-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: economy] [horizon: medium] Lower transaction friction and clearer dispute resolution for firms and consumers interacting with digital assets (custody, insolvency, enforcement). [^lawsociety-digital-assets-2025]
- [unknown] How quickly market practices, standard contracts and court decisions converge on consistent treatment across different asset types. [^digital-assets-act-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Minimal direct public spending; private legal/compliance work to update contracts and policies. [^digital-assets-act-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Benefits concentrate in sectors building on digital assets (finance, tech, legal services); downstream consumer impacts depend on market uptake and safeguards. [^lawsociety-digital-assets-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: legal] Cross-border inconsistency remains a constraint for global markets; clarity on “property” does not resolve all consumer protection and regulatory questions. [^digital-assets-act-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** 2025-12 Royal Assent; 2026+ impacts emerge through contract updates and litigation. [^digital-assets-act-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Valuable clarity, but most benefits are indirect and depend on wider market/regulatory practice.
