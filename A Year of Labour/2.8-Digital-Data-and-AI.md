# 2.8 — Digital, Data and AI

Scope: Data portability that lets people and small firms share their data safely to save money or get better deals; trusted digital identity to prove who you are online; an institute that tests powerful AI models before they go live; modern product safety for online marketplaces; and the Online Safety Act implementation stance (with a separate deep-dive report linked elsewhere).

## Policy Group Notes

- Measured benefits from pilots (fraud reduction, easier switching, SME finance) should be surfaced in simple, human terms (e.g., “minutes saved,” “£ saved per year”), not just technical metrics. [^dsit-cfe-2025]
- AI testing results should explain the risk in plain English (e.g., “the model could be tricked into explaining harmful steps”), and show what changed after fixes. [^aisi-report-2025]
- Data portability should avoid jargon (“download your data” vs “API access”) and give easy routes for people with lower digital confidence. [^dsit-inclusion-2025]
- Product safety updates should spell out what’s new for shoppers (“marketplaces must remove unsafe goods quickly and keep devices updated”). [^opss-marketplace-2025]

# Data (Use & Access) Act 2025 — Smart Data and Digital Identity
[status: enacted] [lead: DSIT/OfDIA] [start: 2025-06] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Give government the legal tools to switch on “Smart Data” schemes across sectors so people can share their own data (like energy use or telecoms bills) with trusted apps to get a better deal, and put the UK’s digital identity trust framework on a firm legal footing so people can prove who they are online easily and safely. [^dua-act-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Primary legislation that (1) lets ministers create sector-specific Smart Data regulations; (2) establishes a statutory Digital Verification Services regime with a government-run register of certified identity providers (via the Office for Digital Identities and Attributes, OfDIA); and (3) brings other data enablers like the National Underground Asset Register into scope. [^dua-act-2025; ^ofdia-register-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: digital] [horizon: short] Act received Royal Assent; OfDIA preparing the statutory provider register and trust mark. [^dua-act-2025; ^ofdia-register-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: digital] [horizon: medium] First Smart Data schemes (energy/telecoms) expected via secondary rules from 2025–26, building on pilots that cut hassle and fraud. [^dsit-roadmap-2025; ^dsit-cfe-2025]
- [unknown] Final design choices (privacy safeguards, redress, inclusion) will be set in sector regulations; real-world uptake depends on user-friendly services. [^ico-brief-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Setup and oversight costs for government and regulators; compliance costs for firms; expected net savings for households/SMEs from easier switching and lower fraud. [^impact-assess-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Benefits everyday users and small businesses by putting them in control of their data; risk of excluding people without smartphones or formal ID unless inclusion measures are built in. [^dsit-inclusion-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: security][risk: delivery][risk: legal] Getting consent, security and liability right; avoiding vendor lock-in; making data standards interoperable across sectors. [^ncc-tech-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** 2025-06 Royal Assent; late-2025 OfDIA register and trust mark go live; 2026 first sector schemes begin (energy/telecoms). [^dsit-roadmap-2025]

**Outcome score:** +2 — Clear enabler for pro-consumer, pro-competition services if implemented with strong safeguards.

**Mechanism(s):** Pilots (e.g., “Perseus” linking business smart meter data to banks for green loans), consultations, and then sector regulations that mandate secure data-sharing pipes between companies and certified third parties. A cross-sector Smart Data Group coordinates standards and timing. [^perseus-pilot-2025; ^smartdata-group-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: energy] [horizon: short] Early energy Smart Data services already help hundreds of thousands compare tariffs or plan retrofits, cutting admin time for households and SMEs. [^energy-pilot-stats-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: digital] [horizon: medium] Standardised data access in telecoms and banking expected to reduce bill shock and fraud, and boost competition. [^dsit-cfe-2025]
- [unknown] Real savings depend on consumer uptake, app quality, and regulator enforcement of standards. [^cma-competition-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Integration and compliance costs for providers; expected net benefits through reduced search costs, fewer errors, and better credit decisions. [^impact-assess-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Strong upside for bill-payers and small firms; ensure accessible design for people with low digital confidence. [^dsit-inclusion-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery][risk: security] Interoperability across legacy IT; consistent, secure consent flows; avoiding “dark patterns.” [^ico-brief-2025]

# Public-Sector Digital Identity — trusted checks for everyday life
[status: programme] [lead: DSIT/OfDIA/Cabinet Office] [start: 2025-06] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Let people prove they are who they say they are online (for example, to rent a flat, verify age, or start a job) using certified apps that meet government standards, without repeatedly scanning paperwork or sharing more data than needed. [^ofdia-register-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Statutory Digital Verification Services: government certifies providers, publishes a register and trust mark, and allows controlled data checks to verify identity attributes (such as age or right to work). Services must be private by default and consent-based. [^dua-act-2025; ^dvf-guidance-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: digital] [horizon: short] The trust framework was piloted for two years; the Act now moves it onto a statutory footing and begins formal certification. [^ofdia-register-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: economy] [horizon: medium] Faster, safer onboarding across renting, hiring and payments reduces fraud and admin burden. [^hmt-fraud-2025]
- [unknown] Inclusion and accessibility outcomes; cross-border recognition with other countries’ ID systems. [^ico-brief-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Certification and compliance costs for providers; net savings from reduced document checks and fraud for employers, landlords and users. [^impact-assess-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Convenience gains for most users; ensure offline routes remain for those without smartphones or formal documents. [^dsit-inclusion-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: security][risk: legal] Strong privacy-by-design, clear liability and robust complaint routes are essential to build trust. [^ico-brief-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Late-2025: register opens and first providers certified; 2026: wider adoption across renting, age checks and right-to-work flows. [^ofdia-register-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — High-utility public infrastructure if delivered with strong privacy, reliable tech and inclusive design. Privacy concerns
