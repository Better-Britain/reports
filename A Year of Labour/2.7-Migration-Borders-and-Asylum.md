# 2.7 — Migration, Borders and Asylum

Scope: System throughput; irregular migration; legal routes; enforcement.

## Policy Group Notes

- Crossings volume and backlog metrics: track quarterly to see if (a) the backlog programme and (b) the France pilot reduce arrivals and hotel use. [links: Backlog Recovery; UK–France Pilot]
- Appeals and tribunals: the best‑laid enforcement and backlog plans still depend on hearing capacity; monitor Ministry of Justice performance and any reforms. [links: Backlog Recovery; Borders & Enforcement Bill]
- Local impacts: safe routes rely on councils for housing and schools; outcome quality depends on local integration grants and capacity. [links: Safe and Legal Routes]
- Legal safeguards: sanctions and removals must balance speed with fairness; transparent guidance and published safeguards reduce legal risk. [links: Border Security Command; Removals & Returns]

# Border Security Command & Smuggling Sanctions
[status: programme] [lead: Home Office/National Crime Agency] [start: 2024-08] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Create a single command to coordinate police, Border Force and the crime agency against people‑smuggling gangs, and cut their money flows with targeted sanctions. [^hoc-border-cmd-2024]

**Mechanism(s):** Administrative reorganisation (new command); sanctions regime that can freeze assets and ban travel for named facilitators; joint tasking with French counterparts on beaches and in the Channel. [^sanctions-regime-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: migration] [horizon: short] Named smugglers designated; first assets and accounts frozen. [^sanctions-first-wave-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: migration] [horizon: medium] Closer cooperation improves arrests and boat seizures on both sides of the Channel. [^uk-fr-police-2025]
- [unknown] Long‑run deterrent effect on crossings volume. [^ifg-brief-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Command staffed largely from existing agencies; sanctions administration funded from HO baseline. [^ho-settlement-2024]

**Distributional effects:** Focuses enforcement on organised criminals, not genuine refugees; minimal direct impact on communities except for fewer criminal operations in coastal areas. [^homeoffice-ethics-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: legal] Evidence standards for sanctions; [risk: delivery] data‑sharing with partners; [risk: political] expectations vs measurable reductions. [^sanctions-guidance-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Command stood up (2024 Q3); first sanctions designations (2025 Q1–Q2); joint operations scale‑up through 2025. [^sanctions-timeline-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Coherent focus on gangs; success hinges on cross‑border intelligence and rapid legal processes.
