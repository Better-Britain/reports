# 2.7 — Migration, Borders and Asylum

Scope: System throughput; irregular migration; legal routes; enforcement.

## Policy Group Notes

- Crossings volume and backlog metrics: track quarterly to see if (a) the backlog programme and (b) the France pilot reduce arrivals and hotel use. [links: Backlog Recovery; UK–France Pilot]
- Appeals and tribunals: the best‑laid enforcement and backlog plans still depend on hearing capacity; monitor Ministry of Justice performance and any reforms. [links: Backlog Recovery; Borders & Enforcement Bill]
- Local impacts: safe routes rely on councils for housing and schools; outcome quality depends on local integration grants and capacity. [links: Safe and Legal Routes]
- Legal safeguards: sanctions and removals must balance speed with fairness; transparent guidance and published safeguards reduce legal risk. [links: Border Security Command; Removals & Returns]
