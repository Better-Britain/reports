Let's do a timeline of the new Online Safety Act. Just major events and who did what, from its conception to today

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s a concise and chronological timeline of the key milestones in the creation and rollout of the UK’s **Online Safety Act (OSA)**—from early proposals to its enforcement and recent developments:

---

### **1. Early Foundations: Online Harms Strategy**

- **April 2019**: The UK government publishes the **Online Harms White Paper**, setting out the initial framework for internet regulation via statutory codes of practice and a duty of care for online platforms. citeturn0search33

### **2. Drafting and Legislative Process**

- **May 2021**: The government publishes the **draft Online Safety Bill**, introducing proposals targeting harmful content and age verification for online services. citeturn0search2

### **5. Legal Challenges and Industry Responses**

- **Public/Industry Reactions**:
  - **Wikipedia and Wikimedia** launch legal challenges, arguing OSA would force identity checks and threaten editorial independence. In **August 2025**, their judicial review challenge is **rejected**. citeturn0search2turn0search12turn0search2
  - Other services, including **Reddit, Bluesky, Discord, Tinder, Bumble, Spotify, X**, implement UK-specific age verification for adult or self-harm-related content. citeturn0search2turn0search2turn0search2
- **International Pushback**:
  - **August 2025**: Platforms **4chan and Kiwi Farms** file a U.S. lawsuit arguing the Act violates U.S. First Amendment rights, as Ofcom demands "risk assessment" submissions under OSA. citeturn0news15turn0news18
  - **U.S. lawmakers** organize hearings to criticize OSA (and the EU’s DSA) for overreach; Nigel Farage is invited to testify. citeturn0news16

### **6. Enforcement and Public Backlash**

### **Bottom Line**

The Online Safety Act emerged from early government proposals (2019), was refined through draft bills and stakeholder input (2021–2022), became law in October 2023, and entered a phased rollout starting early 2025. Key milestones include codes of practice, enforcement kicks starting Spring 2025, and full child protection duties from July 2025. Recent months have seen robust enforcement, public controversy over privacy, and legal challenges—most notably from Wikipedia entities and U.S.-based platforms.

Can you dig deeper and do some thinking to find why Labour implemented it after winning in 2024, when it's such an obviously Tory overreach and poorly thought out policy

Short answer: Labour didn’t “adopt a Tory bill” so much as inherit a law that was already on the statute book and then decide it was politically safer—and practically easier—to press ahead and shape it than to reopen it.

Here’s the why, boiled down:

- \#1 It was a manifesto promise\
  Labour explicitly pledged to “**build on the Online Safety Act**…bringing forward provisions **as quickly as possible**” and even explore going further (e.g., new coroner powers). So delivering fast after July 2024 wasn’t a U-turn; it was the plan. citeturn1view3

- \#2 Public opinion makes the “soft on child safety” risk deadly\
  In late July 2025, **69% of Britons** told YouGov they supported the new age-verification rules (even though most doubted they would work well). Moving to dilute or delay would have invited “you’re siding with predators” attack lines—exactly the line Peter Kyle used against Reform when repeal was floated. citeturn4view0turn0news40

- \#3 The machinery was already rolling\
  The Act got Royal Assent in Oct 2023. By the time Labour took office (Jul 2024), Ofcom had a phased **implementation roadmap** and just needed ministers to do specific bits (lay codes, sign off categorisation thresholds, and make secondary regs). Labour ministers did exactly that on **16 Dec 2024**, explicitly prioritising **swift implementation**. Repeal/major rewrite would have needed precious primary-legislation time. citeturn5view0turn0search0turn2view0

- \#4 Shaping without reopening: use priorities + secondary rules\
  Rather than re-legislate, Labour issued a **Statement of Strategic Priorities** (May 2025)—“safety by design”, transparency, VAWG focus, etc.—steering Ofcom’s approach while keeping momentum. That’s a classic way to put a Labour imprint on a Conservative-era law. citeturn0search2turn0search16

- \#5 Political wedge value\
  The party has leaned into online-harms messaging (misogyny/Tate, protection of boys and girls), and has used the OSA to box in opponents on child protection. Picking a fight to weaken or pause it would have opened an unnecessary flank. citeturn0news41

- \#6 Practical endpoint already in sight\
  With Ofcom’s three-phase plan underway and full implementation slated around **2026**, the fastest way to “fix the internet” (as they frame it) is to **deliver and tweak** rather than delay and rewrite—especially when NGOs would attack any back-sliding. citeturn5view0

If you want, I can map the **specific levers** Labour actually pulled (codes they laid, thresholds they set, guidance they green-lit) versus the parts they could still modify without reopening the Act.

#### You:
Yeah I wrote about that yougov poll, but that came out after the law was activated. I want a list of key individuals by party, to add to the timeline. When I think OSA I think Nadine Dorries and Reese Mogg for some reason, but maybe I'm conflating and want to know the real people who made this happen over the years, and what they did. 

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely — here’s a refined list of the **key individuals by party** who played central roles in shaping and delivering the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA), along with what each contributed. This should slot neatly into your timeline, giving you a clearer sense of *who did what*—and dispelling the Nadine Dorries–Rees-Mogg confusion.

## Key Figures Behind the Online Safety Act (OSA)

### **Conservative Party**

#### **Nadine Dorries** — Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), Sep 2021 – Sep 2022

- **Introduced the Bill to Parliament in March 2022**, marking its formal entry into the legislative process. citeturn0search4turn0news20
- **Strengthened the draft** by adding extra “priority illegal offences” such as revenge porn, suicide facilitation, fraud, and hate crime — ensuring Ofcom could act swiftly. citeturn0search13
- Framed the Bill as a necessary response to rising **online hate and abuse**, including the killing of David Amess, promising to remove “illegal content quickly” and enforce age limits. citeturn0search7turn0search9
- Pushed the legislation forward **despite internal resistance**—for example, Oliver Dowden reportedly told her to “kick the Bill into the long grass,” but she insisted on fast passage. citeturn0search6

#### **Oliver Dowden** — DCMS Secretary, before Dorries (mid-2021)

- Allegedly advised delaying the Bill, urging Dorries to “kick the Online Safety Bill into the long grass.” citeturn0search6

#### **Chris Philp** — Digital Economy Minister (2022)

- Played a key role in **extending the Bill's scope to include commercial pornography websites**, integrating them directly into the safety duties. citeturn0search21turn0search21

#### **Michelle Donelan** — Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology (later)

- **Formally introduced the Bill in the Commons upon transformation into the Act in 2023**. The Bill became the **Online Safety Act 2023**, receiving Royal Assent on **26 October 2023**. citeturn0search21

#### **Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay** — Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Arts and Heritage (Lords)

- **Introduced the Bill in the House of Lords** and facilitated its passage there. citeturn0search21

---

### **Labour Party**

- Labour MPs and Lords engaged during debates, scrutiny, and committee stages — but **no single Labour figure** currently stands out in the public record as a driver of the Bill.
- Labour's role has largely been that of **opposition scrutiny**, influencing amendments around **free speech**, **encryption**, and **harm categories**, though without claiming authorship of policy direction.

---

### **Civic & Campaign Stakeholders (Not MPs but influential)**

#### **Beeban Kidron**, Baroness and co-founder of the **5Rights Foundation**

- Long-time campaigner for child internet safety, often cited by both government and lawmakers as an influential voice in shaping the agenda, even if not formally part of the legislative process. citeturn0search25

Let me know if you’d like to dig into Labour’s critiques, amendments tabled, or committee members who influenced the Bill’s reshaping during its passage — I can fully trace and cite those too.

navlistFurther reading on how the Bill was introducedturn0news20


#### You:
Is there any reasoning available for why Labour put supporting it in their manifesto? Can you find objections or support in hansard or find any other explanations for them being so eager to get it going aside from a general habit of digital privacy erosion and a failure to consider the implications in general from UK politicians?

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly—I’ve found some concrete evidence and statements that illuminate *why* Labour chose to commit to advancing the Online Safety Act in their 2024 manifesto, beyond broad assumptions.

---

## 1. **Labour’s Affirmation of "A Higher Bar for Online Safety"**

From a **Hansard debate on 12 September 2023**, Labour MP Lucy Powell made it explicit:

> “Labour supports the principles of the Online Safety Bill. There has been a wild west online for too long. Huge platforms such as Facebook and Google … lack of regulation has let harms and abuses proliferate.” citeturn0search5

Powell emphasized that:

- Big tech has outgrown its startup roots to now “influence almost every aspect of our lives”—from socializing to news consumption—and regulation has lagged behind.
- The Bill creates a framework of **strong, independent regulation**, which Labour endorsed as a necessary corrective.

---

## 2. **Labour’s Cooperative, Yet Watchful, Position**

Another Bloc in **Hansard, Commons debate (12 Sept 2023)** made the posture clear:

> “Labour has always supported an online safety regime, and has sought to work with the Government while raising valid concerns carefully throughout. … We all want to keep people safe … Labour is proud of the changes it has developed and pushed on … we will continue to push the Government to deliver this regime in good time.” citeturn0search1

Key takeaways:

- Labour didn’t merely support the Bill—they actively collaborated, driving improvements while signalling their intention to maintain oversight and accountability in delivery.

---

## 3. **Manifesto Pledges: Accelerate and Build Upon the Act**

When reviewing the **2024 Labour manifesto**, while it didn’t explain motivations in deep detail, it clearly committed to advancing the Act:

- Labour pledged to **“build on the Online Safety Act”**, bringing provisions “as quickly as possible,” and exploring further safeguards for digital safety. citeturn0search6turn0search2

Although not granular, this reflects a strategic decision:

- Labour viewed the OSA not as a Conservative “payload,” but as a functional baseline to *improve upon*—a present regulatory structure they could ethically and politically lean into, rather than dismantle.

---

## 4. **Public and Campaigner Pressure Reinforcing Political Will**

Though not directly cited in their manifesto, significant advocacy shaped the environment:

- The **Times reported (July 2024)** that Labour ministers, led by Science Secretary Peter Kyle, engaged with bereaved families—including the Molly Rose Foundation—to signal commitment to “building on the Online Safety Act” and intensify protections for children. citeturn0news20

This personalized context:

- Reinforced that Labour’s support was informed by public safety concerns and campaigners’ urging—not mere political opportunism.

---

### In Short

Labour’s support for accelerating the Online Safety Act wasn't coincidental or careless. It appears motivated by:

- A broad consensus that digital regulation is overdue;
- A desire for enforceable, independent oversight of tech harms;
- Political pragmatism—leveraging a ready framework rather than restarting the clock;
- Response to poignant real-world tragedies and advocacy.

If you'd like, I can pull out committee-level scrutiny or shadow minister contributions to add more granularity to your timeline.

Ah that makes more sense, it's an all mps fault thing, cross party support kinda dooms them. I think of it like the cookie law, where they intended it to control companies, but the companies turned it into a personal responsibility thing to avoid the responsibilities. Can you do some digging and thinking and find out how we ended up with the age verification being the only major issue

You’re not wrong that *lots* is going on in the OSA—but **age-verification (AV)** rose to the top because it’s the most visible, deadline-driven piece that *directly* touches ordinary adults, while the rest of the Act mostly bites behind the scenes.

Here’s the path—plus why AV crowded everything else out:

# How AV became *the* story

1. **The old “porn block” never died—OSA revived it, bigger.**\
   The 2017 Digital Economy Act’s AV scheme collapsed in 2019 after delays and privacy/feasibility worries; ministers explicitly said they’d fold its aims into a broader “online harms” regime instead. That promise re-emerged in the OSA: in Feb 2022 government confirmed **all commercial porn sites** would be brought into scope, not just user-generated platforms. citeturn2search4turn2search5turn2search10turn4search1turn4search2

2. **The “free speech” fight was defused in 2022.**\
   The most combustible bit—duties around “legal but harmful” content for adults—was **removed** in late 2022 and replaced with user controls. That took much of the civil-liberties heat out of the adult-speech debate. citeturn0search9

3. **The encryption row was parked in 2023.**\
   Powers that could force scanning of encrypted messages drew intense pushback, but ministers said they wouldn’t use them *until “technically feasible.”* That cooled the immediate E2EE fight—leaving AV as the live, near-term controversy. citeturn1news22turn1search4turn1search6

4. **Ofcom and government *led* with age assurance.**\
   The 2025 implementation push put AV front-and-centre: Ofcom published “**highly effective age assurance**” guidance in January, ministers laid the child-protection codes in April, and **25 July 2025** became the hard date when porn-allowing services needed **strong age checks**. That clear line in the sand guaranteed headlines. citeturn3search2turn3search10turn3search11turn3search9

5. **It’s the only part you feel as a user.**\
   Illegal-content duties, risk assessments and transparency reports mostly hit compliance teams and don’t change day-to-day UX. **AV demands your passport/ID or face-estimation**—so it’s tangible, contentious and easy to mobilise around (petitions, op-eds, workarounds). citeturn3search4turn4search6

6. **Child-safety advocacy converged on AV.**\
   The ICO’s **Children’s Code** primed firms to treat minors differently; civil-society groups (NSPCC/5Rights) consistently framed **porn exposure** as a priority harm, reinforcing AV as the flagship remedy within OSA’s child-safety duties. citeturn0search3turn0search6turn3search7turn3search1

7. **Media incentives + measurable outcomes.**\
   AV produces dramatic before/after numbers (traffic slumps on compliant sites; spikes on those that don’t; VPN surges). That’s fodder for coverage in a way that, say, risk-registers or governance changes aren’t. citeturn4search8turn4search4turn4news21

# Quick timeline of the AV thread (pre-OSA → activation)

- **2017–2019:** DEA Part 3 AV scheme designed; repeatedly delayed; **dropped Oct 2019**, with pledge to achieve aims via “online harms.” citeturn2search0turn2search5turn2search6
- **Apr 2019:** **Online Harms White Paper** signals AV/age-assurance will be part of the new regulator’s toolbox. citeturn2search12
- **Feb 2022:** Government **revives AV** for **all** porn sites in the Online Safety Bill. citeturn4search1turn4search2
- **Nov–Dec 2022:** “Legal but harmful” for adults **removed**, narrowing public fights to child-safety and encryption. citeturn0search9
- **Sept 2023:** Govt says E2EE powers **won’t be used until feasible**. Bill passes; becomes **OSA** Oct 2023. citeturn1search0turn1news22
- **Jan–Apr 2025:** Ofcom issues **age-assurance** guidance and **children’s codes**; govt comms emphasise AV. citeturn3search2turn3search10
- **25 Jul 2025:** **AV goes live** for services allowing porn; Ofcom starts enforcing. citeturn3search11turn0search16

# Bottom line

AV became the lightning-rod because:

- it’s **simple to explain** (“show ID to see porn”),
- **highly user-visible**, with a **fixed start date**,
- **politically safer** than re-fighting E2EE or adult “legal but harmful,” and
- **institutionally prioritised** by Ofcom/govt as the clearest child-safety deliverable after the DEA’s failed attempt.

If you want, I can add a sidebar to your timeline showing how *other* big issues (E2EE scanning powers; service categorisation; illegal-harms risk assessments; journalist content protections) were diluted, deferred, or kept off the front page—and who pushed those moves.

#### You:
Okay they're certainly partly responsible for re stupid outcomes, as I'm sure if they'd listened more to critics of the plan from its 5 years of progress, they _could_ have done something before it went into force, at least before making it necessary for everybody to "hand over their ID" (which isn't really true, as most of these ID checks ARE sandboxed and auto-delete, tho there are some shoddier SaaS implementations that either don't do that, or do do that but don't make it clear). There is an attitude atm to blame Labour for "everything wrong with britain", forgetting the legacy (people have short memories, etc), but they have certainly made some mistakes that I will include in this sub-report (part of our Broken Britain Briefing, but not a very large part, it will link out to a timeline on its own article).

Something I keep running into on this journey of discovery (A year of labour) is a very hostile media environment, arguably worse than even late stage Tories. The papers only went pretty hard against Boris Johnson after the public mood soured following party-gate (the press largely supported him through lockdowns, on the grounds of public health, despite some outliers that more closely represented the 'public mood', especially over 'nitpick' fines). I'd like you to research the general temperature of each of the most read newspapers (online and offline), and the general social media attitude. For sources, ideally you'd find formal/academic/in-depth/independent studies assessing the media environment across many sources, but individual cases or patterns might support assessing this, especially what little we can find within the last year.

#### ChatGPT:
To assess the media and social media climate toward Labour over the past year, could you please clarify a few points:

1. Which specific timeframe should I focus on? (e.g., July 2024–present, post-general election)
2. Are you looking for UK-only publications, or should I include international press coverage?
3. For social media, do you want an overview across all major platforms (Twitter/X, Facebook, TikTok, Reddit, etc.), or any particular ones?
4. Do you want a comparative baseline—e.g., how coverage of Labour compares to previous governments (late-stage Tory), or just a snapshot of the current sentiment?

This will help me tailor the research to your needs more precisely.


#### You:
From mid-2023 probably has some relevance, regarding Labour, they were basically a non-entity through most of the pandemic, becoming relevant as Starmer started making more appearances in advance of/expecting an upcoming election. The 'surprise' election by Sunak wasn't so much a surprise really, but was earlier than expected, likely for strategy (the sooner we do it, the fewer seats we'll lose, tory leadership reasoning). 
UK is primary focus, if overseas studies give us data on the UK, that can support context.
All social media is relevant, tho hard to assess en-masse, maybe focus on studies of social media, or like where newspapers occasionally reference the mood around specific topics. There's probably some YouGov polls to support this too.
A baseline would be useful. Most mainstream british papers lean right generally, with a smaller number of left leaning papers, that do have comparable trust/readership, but the overrall taste for 'newspapers' has been in decline for years. The ongoing popularity of Sky News, and the slight bump to GB News over the last couple of years has some impact on this, especially as trust in the BBC has eroded (sometimes for good reasons, like Boris Johnson's personal friend as an appointee, and repeated failures of care, but also sometimes because of agitators turning molehills into mountains explicitly to erode trust in public broadcasting around the world).

#### ChatGPT:
Got it. I’ll research the tone and temperature of UK media and social media coverage of Labour from mid-2023 to the present, including academic studies, polls, and media analyses. This will focus on mainstream newspapers (online and offline), TV broadcasters like Sky and GB News, and social media platforms. I’ll also explore whether media hostility toward Labour has intensified compared to coverage of the late-stage Conservative government.

I’ll let you know as soon as I have the findings.

# Media Climate and Public Sentiment in the UK (2024–2025)

## Major Newspapers: A Dominant Right-Leaning Press

Britain’s national press landscape has long been tilted to the right, with most high-circulation papers taking a conservative or pro-Tory editorial line. A YouGov survey found that out of eight leading newspapers, five were perceived as predominantly right-wing, versus only two seen as left-wing (the *Guardian* and *Daily Mirror*)【42†L315-L324】【42†L326-L334】. This imbalance is widely recognized: 81% of Britons consider the *Daily Mail* right-wing (44% call it “*very* right-wing”), and similarly large majorities categorize the *Sun*, *Telegraph*, *Times*, *Express*, etc., as leaning right【42†L326-L334】. Meanwhile the *Guardian* is seen as the most left-leaning title, followed by the *Mirror*【42†L327-L335】. The *Independent* (now digital-only) is broadly centrist with a slight left-of-center bent【42†L335-L342】. Below is a brief rundown of the “temperature” – i.e. political slant and recent attitude – of each of the most-read UK news outlets (print and online):

- **Daily Mail / Mail on Sunday:** Britain’s highest-impact mid-market tabloid, staunchly conservative and often aggressively critical of Labour. The *Mail* has been described as the nation’s *most* right-wing newspaper【42†L326-L334】, known for harsh campaigns on immigration, “woke” culture, and Euroskepticism. It vehemently supported Boris Johnson through scandals (even after Partygate, under editor Paul Dacre)【29†L95-L103】【29†L123-L131】, and only very late did cracks appear. Since Labour’s resurgence, the *Mail* has kept its “powder relatively dry” on attacking Keir Starmer personally – focusing ire more on his deputy Angela Rayner – but it still clearly favors the Conservatives【24†L243-L252】. With a large readership, the *Mail*’s influence is significant despite low trust ratings (59% of Britons deem it untrustworthy, giving it a net trust score of –37)【18†L329-L337】. Expect its tone to turn even more hostile if Labour falters on any issue.

- **The Sun:** A mass-market tabloid formerly Britain’s highest circulation paper, owned by Rupert Murdoch. Historically the *Sun* backs the likely winner – famously switching to Tony Blair in 1997 – but generally it skews right-populist and strongly pro-Conservative. During Johnson’s tenure it was loyal; it only soured when public anger grew over scandals【29†L95-L103】. The *Sun* greeted the 2024 election news not with enthusiasm for Sunak but with grumbling about a “spoilt summer,” suggesting lukewarm support for the embattled Tories【24†L256-L264】. It has a sensationalist, anti-“political correctness” tone and often attacks Labour figures (it spent years demonizing Jeremy Corbyn). However, Murdoch papers also prefer to *“back winners”*, so if polls showed an inevitable Labour win, the *Sun* might moderate its tone【24†L255-L264】. Public trust in the *Sun* is abysmal – it’s the single most distrusted outlet in the UK (net trust –53)【18†L327-L334】 – reflecting its reputation for slanted and sometimes reckless coverage.

- **Daily Telegraph:** The traditional Tory broadsheet, unwaveringly conservative. The *Telegraph* has **never** endorsed any party other than the Conservatives and is regarded as a *“true blue”* paper【22†L221-L229】. It consistently amplifies right-wing talking points – e.g. warning of Labour’s “socialist agenda” or branding a Starmer-led government a *“catastrophe”*【22†L197-L206】【22†L223-L231】. Recently, internal turmoil (the Barclay family’s debt default put the paper in limbo) has made it even more strident. In the 2024 campaign its columnists were in full attack mode (“1000 hours to save Britain” from Labour’s tyranny, etc.)【22†L197-L204】. The likely new owner is a Murdoch ally (GB News co-owner Sir Paul Marshall), which suggests the *Telegraph* will remain a loud champion of Conservative populist causes【22†L229-L236】. While its print circulation is smaller than the tabloids, it influences the Tory base and MPs heavily. (Public perception: strongly right-wing, though seen as slightly more serious/centrist than the Mail or *Express*.)

- **The Times:** A Murdoch-owned broadsheet with a center-right, establishment orientation. The *Times* is seen as the most moderate of the right-leaning papers【42†L341-L348】. It generally supports Conservatives but with a more measured tone and quality reporting. Notably, the *Times* eventually called for Johnson’s resignation in July 2022, one day before he quit – “scarcely counting” as brave, but still earlier than other Tory papers【29†L101-L109】. During the lead-up to the 2024 election, the *Times* took a relatively balanced approach: its editorials acknowledged Sunak’s “dreadful hand” but stressed that *both* leaders would be severely tested in the campaign【24†L258-L264】. It did not dive into the frenzied anti-Starmer rhetoric of the tabloids, at least initially. The *Times* aims to retain credibility whichever party wins, and Murdoch’s strategy of hedging bets was evident (his outlets remained *“even more fence-sitting than usual”* as Labour’s lead grew)【24†L255-L264】. Overall, expect the *Times* to scrutinize Labour’s policies but in a less overtly partisan way, and possibly to adjust its editorial stance if Labour secures business confidence. (Trust: The *Times* enjoys moderate public trust for a newspaper, net +14【18†L323-L331】.)

- **Daily Express:** A right-wing tabloid known for its hyperbolic headlines (“*EU to ruin Britain*”-style stories, constant focus on immigration, pensioners, and Princess Diana conspiracies in years past). The *Express* strongly backed Brexit and Tory hardliners. It often campaigns on issues like stopping migrant boats and slashing taxes, aligning with the Conservative right or even Farage’s rhetoric. Under billionaire Richard Desmond and now Reach PLC, its tone remains vehemently anti-Labour. During Corbyn’s era it issued dire warnings about “Marxist” Labour; under Starmer it continues to push that any Labour government would spell disaster. Its circulation is smaller than the *Sun* or *Mail*, but it targets an older demographic (and often stokes their fears). Public trust in the *Express* is very low (net –31)【18†L331-L334】. In the current climate, the *Express* can be expected to join the *Telegraph/Mail* chorus in blaming Labour for societal ills while glossing over Tory-era failings.

- **The Guardian / Observer:** Britain’s leading left-of-center newspaper (the daily *Guardian* and its Sunday stablemate *Observer*). The *Guardian* has a liberal, pro-Labour (or at least anti-Tory) orientation, though it often holds Labour accountable from a progressive standpoint. It was critical of Corbyn at times, but also relentlessly exposed Conservative scandals. Among the public, it’s viewed as the most left-wing mainstream paper【42†L331-L338】. Trust in the *Guardian* is relatively high for a newspaper – about one-third of Britons trust it, and it enjoys a positive net trust (+15)【18†L317-L325】【18†L321-L329】. In terms of reach, the *Guardian* punches above its weight online; Ofcom finds it (with the *Observer*) among the two most widely read digital news titles (on par with *Daily Mail*’s online reach)【39†L323-L331】【39†L333-L340】. In the past year, the *Guardian* has unsurprisingly been *less* hostile to Starmer’s Labour than the right-wing press. It provides a platform for voices supportive of the need for change after 14 years of Tory rule. However, it also features commentary from its left flank that chides Starmer for centrist compromises or calls for more radical action. Overall “temperature”: broadly pro-Labour, but with a critical eye. (Notably, ex-PM Tony Blair recently gave *Observer* interviews praising Starmer and advising him to ignore *“vicious”* abuse on social media【44†L193-L202】, reflecting the paper’s role as a forum for Labour’s internal debates.)

- **Daily Mirror:** The *Mirror* is the major national paper consistently supportive of the Labour Party. A tabloid for a working-class audience, it has a proudly Labour/social democratic lineage. The *Mirror* broke the Partygate scandal story in late 2021, showing its willingness to take on the Tory government【29†L193-L201】. During elections, it unabashedly backs Labour (in 2019 its front pages railed against Boris Johnson). In the current milieu, the *Mirror* strongly champions Starmer’s policies and attacks “Broken Britain” issues left by the Conservatives – though it may criticize Labour from the left if it feels promises to workers are watered down. Despite its noble history, the *Mirror*’s readership has declined and it’s far outnumbered by the combined reach of right-wing tabloids【42†L373-L381】. Public trust mirrors that partisan split: while Labour voters trust it, many Conservatives dismiss the *Mirror* – giving it a net trust of –37 (identical to the *Mail*, but coming from the opposite political perception)【18†L331-L334】. In sum, the *Mirror* remains a loud pro-Labour voice, but its influence is limited next to the Tory-leaning press.

- **The Independent (online) and “i” paper:** The *Independent* ceased print in 2016 but continues as a digital outlet with significant online readership. Its stance is centrist to centre-left, pro-EU, and broadly favoring liberal internationalist viewpoints. It often publishes commentary supportive of Labour or critical of Tory policies, though it’s not as overtly partisan as the *Mirror*. The *Independent* is actually one of the most *trusted* newspaper brands by the public (net trust +16, slightly above the *Guardian*)【18†L319-L327】. The **i** (which was originally a spin-off of the *Independent*) is a small print daily and online site that aims for unbiased reporting. It has no partisan allegiance, but in editorial tone it tends to be factual and moderate – any lean is subtle (some consider it slightly left-of-center on social issues). Neither the *Indy* nor *i* has the reach of the big tabloids, but they contribute to balancing the discourse.

- **Financial Times:** A niche but influential paper, the *FT* caters to business and financial readers. It has a generally pro-market, pro-globalization outlook, and it opposed Brexit. Politically the *FT* often endorses more centrist or economically competent choices – for instance, it has endorsed Conservative or Liberal Democrat candidates in the past, but also supported Tony Blair’s New Labour. In the 2019–2023 period it was highly critical of Brexit hardliners and the economic turmoil under Johnson/Truss. Come 2024, the *FT*’s editorial line was cautiously favorable to Starmer (viewing him as a pragmatic centrist who might restore stability). Notably, the *FT* is the single most trusted news outlet in Britain by net score – 40% trust it vs only 10% distrust (+30 net)【18†L310-L318】. Its readership is small in number but powerful in influence (corporate and policy elites). In the media mix, the *FT* provides more neutral, analytical coverage rather than the populist attacks seen in the tabloids.

*Overall*, the print/online press in late 2023 and 2024 created what many observers call a **hostile media environment** for the Labour Party. Well before the general election, the conservative papers were on the offensive. By May 2024, as the campaign kicked off, right-wing outlets were effectively treating Labour as a dangerous threat to Britain – Allister Heath in the *Telegraph* warned there were “just 1,000 hours to save Britain” from Starmer’s “tyranny”【22†L197-L204】, and the *Mail* and *Express* consistently ran stories undermining Labour proposals. This hostility is not new (Jeremy Corbyn faced *“overwhelmingly negative”* press coverage in 2019【19†L215-L224】【19†L220-L228】), but some argue it has reached new heights. An academic analysis during the 2019 campaign showed newspaper coverage gave Boris Johnson’s Conservatives a net positive tone while Corbyn’s Labour was hammered with around **75% net negative** tone【19†L219-L227】【19†L220-L228】. In 2024, early Loughborough University media audits indicated a similar or worse imbalance, though notably as the election neared, even some right-leaning papers hedged their bets when a Labour victory looked likely【24†L255-L264】【24†L273-L278】.

Now that Labour is in government (after 14 years in opposition), the press scrutiny has, if anything, intensified. Within the first year of Starmer’s premiership, pundits noted *“relentless criticism of the Labour Government from a hostile media”* – to the point of **questioning its legitimacy to govern**【25†L103-L111】【25†L145-L153】. Every policy hiccup or tough decision (e.g. trimming the universal winter fuel allowance) has been seized upon as a “betrayal” or “own goal” in media narratives【25†L147-L155】. Meanwhile, the same outlets devote far less attention to context – such as the 14-year legacy of Conservative austerity and economic stagnation that set the stage【25†L153-L161】. For example, Professor Chris Painter observes that outlets hammer Labour for painful choices while saying *“relatively little about”* how Tory policies protected wealthy pensioners at the expense of younger workers and public services【25†L153-L161】. In other words, much of the press has exhibited a double standard: quick to blame Labour for “everything wrong with Britain” (as if the country’s crises started on Day 1 of the new government) while glossing over the mess left behind by their preferred party. Some attack lines have verged on the hyperbolic – painting Starmerism as either a re-heated redux of Blair destined for failure, or tarring Starmer as an authoritarian figure, depending on the outlet【25†L163-L170】. This *all-guns-blazing* approach so soon into a Labour administration is indeed, as the user notes, even more hostile than the press was toward the late-stage Tory government. (Recall that many papers **stayed loyal** to Boris Johnson “right to the bitter end” despite his *“venality and systematic lying”*, only turning on him when public anger over Partygate made his position untenable【29†L95-L103】【29†L118-L126】.) The contrast is stark – a Tory PM was given the benefit of the doubt for years, whereas the new Labour PM faced furious press attacks within weeks.

It’s worth mentioning that newspaper influence, while still significant, is not quite as dominant as in decades past. Print circulations are a fraction of what they once were, and younger audiences get their news online or via social media far more. Nonetheless, the agenda-setting power of tabloids and broadsheets remains strong, especially in TV discussion and online news aggregation. And collectively, the readership of right-leaning papers still vastly exceeds that of left-leaning ones【42†L373-L381】, meaning a majority of daily news consumers are indeed imbibing a generally anti-Labour media tone.

## Broadcast News: Trust, Shifts and “Culture War” Channels

Television and radio remain key news sources in the UK – with a reputation (at least historically) for greater impartiality than the press. Among TV news outlets, **BBC News** has long been dominant in reach, though not without recent challenges. As of 2023, BBC1’s news bulletins were still the single most-used news source (about 49% of adults get news from BBC1)【36†L219-L227】【36†L231-L239】, and the BBC’s combined TV, radio and online reach dwarfs any other provider (more than double the weekly audience of its nearest competitor)【34†L289-L297】. However, the BBC’s position is gradually *eroding*: its audience reach has been *“falling over time, especially with younger audiences”*【14†L276-L284】, and public trust in the BBC has declined amid political polarization. Only 42% of Britons now say they trust the BBC to tell the truth, while 53% express little or no trust – a net negative sentiment【31†L329-L337】【31†L330-L338】. (Two decades ago, trust in the BBC was much higher; one poll noted a **43-point drop** in trust since 2003【30†L1-L4】.) This erosion of trust comes from both sides of the spectrum: segments of the right see the BBC as having a liberal or “Remainer” bias, while segments of the left accuse it of having been too soft on the Tories (especially under a Conservative-appointed BBC chairman). The BBC has faced **intense scrutiny** and controversy in recent years – from the Richard Sharp scandal (a Boris Johnson ally installed as BBC chair) to rows over how it handled presenters’ social media (e.g. the Gary Lineker impartiality saga)【34†L285-L293】【34†L323-L331】. All this has fed into what one analyst calls a “*vocal minority*” attacking the BBC and public media, even as a “silent majority” continues to use and value it【34†L301-L309】【34†L303-L311】. Notably, despite the noise, impartial broadcasters like BBC, ITV and Channel 4 *remain* the most trusted news sources overall【34†L337-L345】. Surveys consistently find the **BBC, ITV News, and Channel 4 News at the top of trust rankings**, well ahead of any newspaper【18†L315-L323】【18†L317-L325】. For example, in 2023 net trust scores were strongly positive for ITV (+28) and Channel 4 (+27), and +23 for BBC News【18†L315-L323】. So while the BBC’s halo has slipped a bit, it’s still trusted more than most – just not by certain partisan fringes.

**Sky News** (the 24-hour news channel) is another major player, generally regarded as a straight news provider with no obvious bias. Sky, being a commercial broadcaster, doesn’t have a formal impartiality mandate as strict as the BBC’s, but in practice it has maintained a solid reputation. It draws a sizable viewership, though less than the BBC’s total reach. Sky News is seen as relatively trustworthy (net trust +13)【18†L317-L324】. During the turbulent recent years, Sky’s political coverage – e.g. tough interviews by journalists like Beth Rigby or Kay Burley – won respect as they held Conservative ministers to account. Sky did not shy from covering Partygate or government failings extensively, which likely contributed to some Conservatives grumbling about it, but overall it’s not seen as having a partisan slant akin to newspapers. Sky’s audience is smaller and older than it used to be (many younger people now get clips via YouTube or social media), but it remains an important source, especially at times of breaking news or election nights. Notably, Sky has also tried to fend off the new “opinionated” competitors by emphasizing its commitment to fact-based reporting【15†L9-L17】.

In the past few years, **new entrants on the airwaves with explicit ideological tilts** have emerged – most prominently **GB News** (launched 2021) and **TalkTV** (launched 2022). These are often likened to U.S.-style partisan cable news. **GB News** pitches itself as an anti-“woke” channel giving a voice to “silenced” views; in practice it leans strongly rightward (many presenters are Tory-aligned or from right-wing media). Initially ridiculed for low production quality and tiny audiences, GB News has slowly grown a niche following. By 2023 it reached about *6–7% of UK adults weekly*【34†L337-L345】【34†L346-L354】 – a small but non-trivial audience, **“the same as the free Metro newspaper and more than any other national newspaper”** in weekly reach, according to the Reuters Institute【34†L343-L351】【34†L347-L355】. Its viewers are mostly older, male, and politically on the right【34†L349-L357】. GB News made headlines by occasionally beating the long-established BBC News Channel in certain time slots by 2025 (particularly prime-time opinion shows)【32†L293-L301】【32†L303-L311】. In July 2025, for example, GB News averaged \~80k viewers across the day, narrowly above the BBC News channel’s \~78k – though in total weekly reach the BBC channel was still twice as large【32†L271-L279】. GB News cleverly keeps its core viewers engaged for longer periods, boosting average audience metrics【32†L273-L281】【32†L275-L283】. However, **trust in GB News is extremely low among the general public** – only \~24% say they trust it to tell the truth【31†L329-L337】【31†L331-L335】. In fact, GB News is the *least trusted* UK news broadcaster, and the only one with a net negative trust rating (–15) as of 2025【15†L13-L16】. This reflects that outside its fan base, many view it as pushing a partisan agenda and even misinformation. (Ofcom has sanctioned GB News multiple times for breaches of impartiality rules and airing inaccurate or offensive content【22†L189-L197】【22†L199-L207】.) Still, its *existence* has some impact: it pulls the political conversation rightward on certain issues (e.g. culture-war topics) and has put pressure on other broadcasters to not ignore stories that galvanize GB News’s audience.

**TalkTV**, a Murdoch-owned entrant (with personalities like Piers Morgan), has had even lower ratings than GB News and similarly low trust. These channels together represent an experiment in importing a Fox News-style model. **So far, British audiences have not broadly embraced partisan TV news** – the majority still prefer the traditional broadcasters【34†L337-L345】【34†L347-L355】. Reuters Institute data noted that while GB News is “building an audience,” Britons overall *have not* endorsed highly opinionated news: *“the American model is still struggling for acceptance”* in the UK【34†L349-L357】【34†L355-L359】. That said, these channels have amplified certain narratives (often anti-Labour, anti-immigration, anti-net-zero, etc.), contributing to the hostile media climate for the current government.

It’s also important to mention **ITV News and Channel 4 News**. **ITV News** (including the flagship *News at Ten* and regional bulletins) remains widely watched (34% use ITV as a news source)【36†L219-L227】 and enjoys high trust across the spectrum【18†L315-L323】. ITV’s political coverage is generally seen as neutral; for instance, during Partygate, ITV’s UK editor Robert Peston faced criticism of being *too soft* on Johnson at times, but ITV also broke some key scoops (the infamous Downing Street party video was leaked to ITV News). **Channel 4 News**, a nightly program, is known for rigorous investigative journalism and has a reputation (especially on the right) of being a bit left-leaning. Some Conservative politicians accuse Channel 4 of liberal bias – indeed right-wing voters are more likely to perceive it as favouring Labour【18†L339-L347】. But it’s still a public-service broadcaster bound by impartiality rules, and its reports have held *all* governments to account. Channel 4 News is one of the most trusted news sources (often topping trust polls alongside the BBC)【18†L315-L323】. In recent years, the Johnson government’s attempt to **privatize Channel 4** was seen by many as retaliation for its fearless coverage. (That plan was dropped after outcry.)

Finally, **news consumption habits** are shifting overall. Traditional TV news is losing young viewers to online streaming and social media. But one silver lining for reliable broadcasters: *when big breaking stories happen, people still flock to the BBC and Sky*【15†L9-L17】. The Queen’s death in 2022, for example, drew tens of millions to BBC coverage【34†L307-L315】. This suggests that despite noise about bias, the public largely knows where to turn for sober reporting in serious moments. With an election due in 2024, the BBC even launched initiatives like **BBC Verify** to fact-check misinformation in real time【14†L278-L284】, trying to shore up trust. The *bottom line* is that TV news remains a key pillar of information – and while new challengers nibble at the edges, the likes of BBC/ITV/C4 are still critical in shaping public opinion, and they are generally less hostile to any party than the print tabloids. (Even so, the government – whether Tory or Labour – often accuses the BBC of bias whenever coverage displeases it, so the perception of neutrality is continuously tested.)

## Social Media Sentiment: Polarized and “Vicious”

The **social media** landscape in Britain is vast and fractured, making it hard to quantify a single “general attitude.” Platforms like **Facebook** and **Twitter (X)** host millions of users engaging in political debate – often in highly partisan echo chambers. What is clear is that online discourse can be *extremely hostile* and reactive, amplifying criticisms and conspiracies far faster than traditional media. As the user alludes, there have been concerted efforts by various actors to erode trust in institutions (from the BBC to electoral systems) via social networks. Agitators and disinformation peddlers can turn “molehills into mountains,” seizing on minor issues to stoke outrage and deepen cynicism toward public broadcasters or governments.

One notable trend is that **social media tends to swing against whoever is in power**, though not in a balanced way. Under the Conservative government of 2010–2024, especially in its latter years, hashtags like **#ToriesOut** and viral posts lambasting Tory austerity or scandal were rampant. Public Facebook groups and Twitter activists played a role in shaping the narrative that Britain was broken under the Tories. Conversely, since Labour took office, one can observe a surge in posts attacking Starmer’s government from multiple sides – right-wing commentators labeling it incompetent or too “woke,” and hard-left voices accusing it of not being true socialism. Former PM Tony Blair warned Starmer about exactly this phenomenon, advising him to *“ignore the ‘vicious’ social media platforms”* where *“inevitable criticism will rain down”* on any leader【44†L193-L202】【44†L203-L211】. Blair noted that doom-scrolling through online abuse can *“do your head in”* and that a Prime Minister must filter out the noise to stay focused【44†L193-L202】【44†L205-L213】. In essence, the *temperature* on social media is often boiling – an unfiltered torrent of both genuine public grievances and orchestrated trolling.

Studies of social media mood show a mixed picture. Polling indicates that **partisanship heavily skews perceptions and online engagement**. For instance, supporters of the right-wing Reform UK party exhibit dramatically low trust in almost all institutions and mainstream media – except they *do* trust content from outlets like GB News on social media【31†L329-L337】【31†L371-L379】. Meanwhile, left-leaning users might trust BBC/Guardian posts but dismiss anything from *Daily Mail* or *Sun* as propaganda. This means on Facebook or Twitter, you’ll find parallel universes: in one, Labour can do no right; in another, Labour can do no wrong and every problem is still the Tories’ fault. Surveys by YouGov underline this polarization. For example, among 2019 Labour voters, trust in outlets like Channel 4 or the *Guardian* is sky-high, whereas virtually none trust the *Daily Mail* or GB News; conversely, Tory voters trust the *Mail* and GB News much more and distrust left media【18†L339-L348】【18†L355-L363】. These biases carry over into who people follow and believe on social platforms.

On specific issues, social media can whip up storms that then influence mainstream coverage. For instance, during the 2023 Israel-Gaza conflict, Starmer’s cautious stance drew enormous backlash on platforms like Twitter, with hashtags demanding a Gaza ceasefire and accusing him of complicity. That online furor translated into real-world pressure on Labour (protests, petitions) and plenty of negative headlines. Similarly, policies like the mentioned ID checks or benefits changes can trend on social media with claims that *“Labour betrays \[group]…” which spread long before official communications counter them.* The **speed and venom** of social media criticism often far outpaces what print papers write. Even moderate policies can be met with viral outrage if framed evocatively in a tweet or TikTok. Politicians from all parties now monitor social trends closely – though as Blair suggested, doing so obsessively can be paralyzing.

It’s also worth noting the **decline of traditional forums** like comment sections or moderated message boards in favor of algorithm-driven feeds. This has contributed to more insular “tribes” on social apps. **Facebook** remains a major source of news for about 30% of adults【36†L219-L227】, but its algorithms tend to reinforce existing views (and Facebook has been rife with misleading memes and angry group posts). **Twitter (X)**, used by \~17% for news【36†L235-L243】, is the loudest for political journalists – trends there often make it into news reports. However, Twitter’s credibility has taken a hit, especially after Elon Musk’s takeover led to an increase in hate speech and misinformation【43†L9-L14】. The UK government even noted concerns about **misinformation on social media inciting real-world disturbances**, e.g. in Southport 2023 a false child-kidnapping rumor spread on Facebook led to violence, prompting Starmer to warn tech firms to crack down【43†L35-L43】. **TikTok** and **Instagram** are growing as news sources for younger people (TikTok news usage jumped to \~10% in 2023)【34†L262-L270】【34†L272-L280】, and while political content there is often apolitical or infotainment, it can still drive narratives (e.g. short clips of MPs going viral, or partisan influencers appealing to youth).

In summary, the **social media attitude is highly charged and often negative**. There is a sense of *perpetual outrage* online: under the Tories it was outrage at austerity and scandals; now much is outrage that Labour isn’t fixing everything overnight – and concurrently, outrage from others that Labour is changing *anything* at all. This aligns with polls showing Britons are very pessimistic about the state of the country (80%+ say Britain is in a bad state) and cynical about politics【40†L335-L343】【40†L346-L354】, which social media both reflects and amplifies. The **“Broken Britain”** discourse plays out heavily online: every NHS crisis, crime incident, or cost-of-living woe is seized upon as evidence of national decline, with users quick to assign blame (often hashtagging either #ToryChaos or #LabourFail depending on tribe). Such discourse is often *less tempered* than traditional media; there’s no editor to tone down a viral post claiming “Britain is finished, thanks Keir!” or, on the flip side, “14 years of Tory ruin!”

Interestingly, while social media can distort perceptions of media bias (people in echo chambers think *all* media is against them – a classic **hostile media effect**), objective research suggests most Britons still agree on basic expectations for news. They want accuracy, fairness, and holding power to account【11†L101-L110】【11†L113-L121】. The challenge is that online, it’s easy to find a version of “news” that aligns with one’s anger. Thus, the general social media mood is one of **heightened skepticism and blunt hostility** toward whichever leaders are in the crosshairs at the moment. Starmer’s government will need a thick skin: as Blair noted, *“torrents of criticism… just come with the territory”* now【44†L201-L209】【44†L211-L218】.

## Conclusion

In the current UK media environment, a newly installed Labour administration faces stiff headwinds. The **newspapers with the largest reach predominantly lean right**, and many have turned up the volume on anti-Labour rhetoric – in some cases even *more* ferociously than they criticized the preceding Conservative regime. This persistent bias is borne out by independent analyses of coverage and is perceived by the public at large (e.g. most Britons recognize the press is largely right-wing)【42†L315-L324】【42†L373-L381】. A few left-leaning outlets exist to present the other side, but they are outnumbered in circulation. On the **broadcast side**, public service media still strive for balance and retain higher trust, yet they too are under pressure – from political actors chipping away at their credibility and from upstart channels pushing polarized content. Meanwhile, **social media** acts as an amplifier of criticism and crisis, often painting an even bleaker picture and spreading discontent (sometimes fairly, sometimes not).

All these factors create a media atmosphere that can fairly be described as *hostile* for the governing Labour Party. The press’s traditional role of holding power to account is one thing – and indeed robust scrutiny is vital – but the current tenor often crosses into outright antagonism and one-sided blame. The risk is that media narratives scapegoat the current government for “Broken Britain” while letting the previous incumbents’ culpability fade from memory. For readers and viewers, navigating this landscape requires awareness of each source’s slant. As our sources show, the British public is increasingly aware of bias and many have lost trust in media generally, contributing to news avoidance and cynicism【34†L331-L339】【34†L333-L341】. Yet, understanding these dynamics is the first step to critically evaluating the daily barrage of headlines and tweets.

For Labour, dealing with this environment means expecting harsh coverage no matter what – and communicating directly to the public where possible (through trusted forums or even their own social channels) to counteract misinformation. The year 2024–2025 has demonstrated that Britain’s media climate remains as polarized as its politics, if not more. The tabloids and certain TV segments will likely continue casting the country’s problems as *“Labour’s fault”*, even as more even-handed outlets remind us of the longer trajectory that led here. It will be up to discerning citizens to parse the noise – and up to media scholars and independent voices to keep shining a light on how news is being framed. As one Guardian columnist wryly noted during the election, the right-wing media were frantically trying to “save Britain” from Labour while also desperately trying to **save themselves** in a changing media age【22†L181-L189】【22†L187-L194】. In that struggle, truth can be a casualty.

#### You:
do a quick 'thinking' mode newspaper readership analysis, not just in circulation, but consider things like how much content from each publication is 'shared', particularly within the UK. I know the Daily mail for example has large american readership via online, but it rarely gets the kind of traction online among UK readers that used to get, and nowadays people 'tend' towards sharing the guardian or the i/independent/metro, as the broader sheets usually paywall their more interesting or important pieces. I'd like to get a sense of how much each newspaper (online and offline) affects public opinion. Doesn't need to be bulletproof, but like, where do british people get their ideas of how the country is working from? It's important to identifying how minds are being managed, informed, or even 'manipulated', regardless of the source, like there's not a lot of 'citizen journalists', aside from maybe some substacks with tiny pct readers, and most social media is driven by opinions loosely derived from weak or toxic or incomplete or partisan news stories, social media doesn't feed on empty space (usually), so we want to understand how much it is feeding on what 'sources'.

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s a **quick but insightful "thinking-mode"** analysis of how different UK news publications—print and digital—shape public opinion through consumption *and* sharing, particularly in the UK. This isn’t exhaustive precise stats (they’re hard to find), but it marries what we do know about reach, sharing behavior, and influence.

---

### Key Channels That Shape Public Ideas

#### 1. **Traditional Broadcast Still Reigns (for trust and reach)**

- **TV & Public Service Media (PSMs)** remain top news sources: \~70% of UK adults consume news via TV and PSBs weekly.
- **Online news now matches TV** at \~71% reach. Social media is also central—**52% of UK adults use it for news**. Facebook (30%) leads, followed by TikTok, Instagram, YouTube.
- Still, **BBC/ITV/Channel 4** are most trusted—trusted more than any newspaper.\
  citeturn0search0turn0search6turn0news20

#### 2. **Online News Consumption Shifts & Challenges**

- **Newspaper consumption (both print and digital)** is **declining significantly**.
- Many consumers avoid news altogether due to negativity and distrust—less than half watch TV news weekly, and even fewer visit news websites.\
  citeturn0news20

#### 3. **Newspapers: Reach vs Shareability**

- **Print circulation** has dropped sharply, especially in local news. However, *The Impartial Reporter* is thriving thanks to investigative local journalism.\
  citeturn0news21turn0search31
- **National tabloids** like *The Sun* still lead in overall reach—\~23 million UK adults in FY 2024, plus the biggest YouTube channel for a UK newspaper.\
  citeturn0news25

#### 4. **Digital Footprint & Sharing Behavior**

- **The Guardian** remains a powerhouse online—its news site reaches \~23 million UK adults per month and is widely trusted—especially its free access model fuels sharing.\
  citeturn0search29turn0search12
- **The i** has built strong digital trust and breadth: once the most trusted digital news brand and award-winning. Its readable style without paywalls increases shareability.\
  citeturn0search32
- Publications like *The Times* are behind paywalls. While they have decent digital subscriptions (\~600,000 by late 2024), paywalls limit shareability beyond their subscriber base.\
  citeturn0search26

#### 5. **News Sharing Patterns on Social Media**

- Older academic work shows news sharing forms echo chambers—people mostly share from sources aligned with their existing views. *Guardian* and *i* perform well in left-leaning networks; tabloids perform in right-leaning circles.\
  citeturn0academia28
- Local news sharing via Twitter (dataset from UKTwitNewsCor) reveals strong but *localized* engagement—not typically going viral beyond regional audiences.\

### Summary: Who Influences UK Public Ideas, and How?

| Outlet / Platform              | Influence Mode                    | Effect on Public Opinion                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **BBC / ITV / C4**             | Broadcast & online video          | High trust and reach—primary agenda setters            |
| **Social Media & Aggregators** | Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Google | Massive reach; amplifies news and shapes discourse     |
| **Sun / Mail (tabloids)**      | Print + digital reach             | Still broad exposure, though less digital shareability |
| **Guardian / i**               | Online free access                | High shareability, trust—shaping digital networks      |
| **The Times**                  | Paywalled quality content         | Influence focused on subscriber audiences, less viral  |
| **Local Papers**               | Granular community presence       | Trusted locally, but limited national impact           |

---

### Bottom Line — “Where Do British People Get Their Ideas?”

- **TV news remains influential**, particularly via the BBC and ITV—trusted and still front-of-mind for many.
- **Online news consumption** is vast and diversifying, but **traditional newspapers—particularly tabloids—have lost share**, especially digitally.
- **The Guardian and i** punch above their weight in shaping what gets shared and discussed, due to trust and accessible formats.
- **Tabloids like The Sun maintain raw exposure**, but their online reach depends more on brand strength than engagement.
- **Paywalled outlets** reach fewer people and exert influence in narrower circles.
- **Local journalism remains relevant in communities**, but lacks national reach.

In social media realms, users **share what they can access openly** and trust—thus, the *Guardian* and *i* commonly inform public discourse via reposts, whereas paywalled content or tabloids may not.

---

**Conclusion:** The public’s ideas are shaped by a complex mix—**trusted broadcasters for mass presence**, **free trusted journalism (like Guardian & i) for digital spread**, **tabloid reach for attention**, and **local media for neighborhood influence**. Social media amplifies what's available, trusted, and emotionally resonant, meaning accessible, high-trust platforms disproportionately steer public conversation—even if they don’t have the absolute largest brand.

Let me know if you'd like to deep-dive specific genres (e.g., politics vs lifestyle), generational differences, or platform-by-platform breakdowns!

#### You:
An important element to add to the context, which again requires your 'thinking' mode, is how the British information environment compares to other nations. It's easy for online complainers to say "the mainstream media is all lies and bullshit", but I need to know how much water that position holds. I'd argue almost every other developed nation (maybe except _some_ european nations) has a worse overrall media environment for people to rely on (almost every nation's own national broadcaster is more partisan than the BBC, for example), so we want to put the big picture into meaningful context to rebutt the claim that "it's all bullshit and they're all just in it for themselves" (something I am guilty of more moderately suggesting sometimes, mainly due to business-decisions, metric-chasing and screwy incentives at most media organisations, as businesses, like the profit motive does corrupt, but how much?).

Here’s a quick, comparative “thinking-mode” read on the UK information environment vs. other developed countries—so you can push back on the “MSM is all lies” line with some context.

# Snap verdict

- The UK is **not** the worst place to be a news consumer. On several structural measures (independent regulators, strong public-service broadcasting rules) it’s **better than** the US and many others.
- It’s **not** the best either. Trust is relatively low here compared with the Nordic high-trust cluster, and ownership concentration plus partisan tabloids do drag quality down.
- So the blanket claim “it’s all bullshit” doesn’t hold water; the more accurate take is “**mixed quality, strong institutions, weak trust**.”

# The big picture (compare & contrast)

**1) Trust in news: UK low–mid, not bottom**

- Global trust has flatlined at **40%**. The UK sits **around \~35%** and has fallen \~16 points since 2015—worse than the Nordics but better than the lowest-trust countries. Finland \~**67%**, Hungary/Greece **\~22%**. citeturn1search1turn1search9turn2search14

**2) Press freedom: UK scores “good/satisfactory,” well above the US**

- **RSF 2025:** UK ranks **20/180** (score 78.9). The US is **57/180** (“problematic”). That’s a clear structural advantage for the UK environment. citeturn1search0turn2search4

**3) Public-service media: UK is unusually strong**

- BBC/ITV/C4 operate under **statutory impartiality** and are still among the **most trusted** news sources in the country, despite noisy criticism and slipping youth reach. Ofcom’s latest market reports still show BBC as the single most-watched TV/news brand (and heavy overall video share), with YouTube rising fast among under-35s. citeturn0search4turn0search7
- Globally, many national broadcasters are **more politicised** (US has no equivalent PSB with UK-style impartiality rules; several European state broadcasters face direct government pressure). The UK’s rules and regulator create real guardrails—even if individual outputs get flak. citeturn0search6

**4) Ownership & pluralism: a UK weak spot**

- The UK press is **highly concentrated** and predominantly **right-leaning** in national print, which affects agenda-setting and tone (and helps explain the persistent “hostile media” feeling for Labour governments). Recent work again flags consolidation risks. citeturn0search15

**5) News avoidance & mood: a global problem, not uniquely British**

- **News avoidance** keeps rising worldwide; the UK and US are both in the **low-mid-40s%** of people who often/sometimes avoid news. Drivers: negativity, volume, helplessness—then algorithmic feeds amplify the worst bits. This is not a uniquely UK “media rot”; it’s a **systemic, international** shift. citeturn0news75turn0search13

**6) Social platforms now rival TV for agenda-setting**

- In the UK, online news reach now matches or exceeds TV; social feeds are central, especially for under-35s. That matters because **much of what goes viral is repackaged from mainstream outlets**—but with **emotionally charged framing**. The original reporting may be sober; the share-layer often isn’t. (Same pattern globally.) citeturn0search3

# How the UK stacks up vs specific peers

- **Vs US:** UK wins on **press-freedom ranking**, has **independent regulator** (Ofcom) and binding **impartiality** standards. The US environment is more polarized (partisan cable), lower RSF rank, and—per 2025—experienced further deterioration. citeturn2search4turn2search6
- **Vs Nordics (Finland/Norway):** UK lags on **trust** and civility, though still has strong PSB frameworks. If you want a gold-standard rebuttal for “all MSM is lies,” point to Finland’s consistently **very high trust** ecosystem. citeturn2search1turn2search3
- **Vs Southern/Eastern Europe:** UK fares **much better** on RSF rankings and institutional independence; some countries show **very low trust** and heavier political capture of broadcasters. citeturn2search14

# What’s actually true about UK media “BS” claims

- **Kernel of truth:** commercial incentives (clicks, churn, paywalls) + ownership concentration + a loud tabloid culture **do** warp priorities and tone; trust has **eroded**; a lot of online debate is driven by **hot takes** built on thinly read articles. citeturn0search15turn1search9
- **But not “all lies”:** independent indicators (RSF, Ofcom compliance, PSB trust) show the UK still has **robust professional journalism**, enforcement for **accuracy/impartiality** on broadcast, and **internationally above-average protections**. Most people who fact-check say they still **turn first to a trusted news source**, not rumor mills. citeturn1search7

# Use-in-copy lines you can lift

- “By international standards, the UK has **stronger safeguards** (Ofcom, BBC/ITV/C4 impartiality) and **higher press-freedom scores** than the US—so it isn’t ‘all propaganda’, even if trust is low and tabloids are loud.” citeturn1search0turn0search6
- “Where the UK underperforms is **trust**: roughly **a third** of Britons say they trust the news—far below Finland’s two-thirds, but **not** bottom-of-Europe either.” citeturn1search9
- “The real problem is **distribution**: social platforms reward outrage, so **mainstream stories** become **partisan rockets**—the system amplifies heat over light in **every** country, not just the UK.” citeturn0search5

If you want, I can turn this into a one-pager graphic for the Briefing: UK vs peers on **RSF rank**, **trust**, **news avoidance**, **PSB strength**, and **ownership concentration**, with short ‘what this means’ captions.


#### You:
Okay good. We probably also need to address the lower funding for 'real journalism' and (probably unintentional) attitude against it, like why journalists don't have time to make every piece a deeply research dive into every possible aspect of the story, but instead trend towards churnalism. It's an exploration of incentives for 'good news' (qualititively meaninful, hard to read, spreads slowly, if at all), versus 'bad news' (highly shareable, good platform metrics). I have personal problems with specific journalists (locally and nationally) who could do better but don't, and want to address the reasons for that, big and small.

Really. fucking, THINK about it.

Got it. Here’s a straight-talk “why the system produces churnalism” map—UK-specific, but with global forces that squeeze almost every newsroom.

# TL;DR

Deep, original reporting is **time-intensive, risky, and hard to monetise**. The business model rewards **volume, speed, and emotional click-through**. Fewer journalists, more PR, and platform gatekeepers mean the path of least resistance often wins.

---

## 1) Money: the ad market flipped—and publishers lost power

- **Platforms ate the ad pie**. The UK competition regulator found Google and Meta hold dominant shares of search and display ad markets—leaving publishers with scraps and weak bargaining power. Result: fewer staff, more output targets, thinner reporting. citeturn0search9turn0search4
- **Platform referrals collapsed**. Facebook’s pivot away from news cut publisher referrals by \~**48% in 2023**, with X/Twitter also down; UK groups (e.g., Reach) explicitly tie revenue falls and job cuts to these shifts. That pushes editors toward whatever still brings traffic now (commodity rewrites, SEO hits). citeturn2search0turn2search2turn2news20
- **Search volatility + zero-click**. Recent Google updates (2024–25) and AI summaries increase “read here, don’t click” answers—again shrinking upside for slow investigations. citeturn2search15turn2news21

## 2) Fewer reporters, more quotas, more “live” formats

- The UK’s largest commercial publisher **keeps cutting and reshaping** newsrooms; managers push higher story counts to claw back page views. That’s a structural nudge toward quick rewrites and liveblogs, not weeks of digging. citeturn1search15turn6search7turn1search6
- UK journalists themselves report **longer hours, less time per story**, and rising profit pressures—exactly the conditions that breed “churn.” (Reuters Institute survey of UK journalists.) citeturn4search2

## 3) PR tsunami vs. shrinking newsrooms

- The UK has **more PRs than journalists** (ONS-linked counts put PRs roughly 9–14k ahead). Newsrooms drowning in pitches + fewer staff = more copy that starts life as a release. citeturn1search2turn1search5
- Classic UK studies show a **big share of press content** originates in PR and wire copy; agency text often passes through with minimal reporting. This is *the* empirical backbone of “churnalism.” citeturn4search3turn7search0

## 4) Metrics, headlines, and the attention economy

- **Negative words lift clicks**. Large-scale experiments find each extra negative word in a headline raises click-through \~**2–3%**. When the dashboard (Chartbeat/Parse.ly) runs the day, editors learn fast. citeturn8search0
- Negative stories also **spread more on social** than positive ones, so emotion-laden, short-cycle content beats nuanced, slow pieces in distribution. citeturn8search3
- Result: “good” (public-interest) news is **expensive, slow, legally thorny, modestly read**; “bad” (fast, affective) news is **cheap and shareable**. The incentives are obvious.

## 5) Legal and access friction raise the cost of real reporting

- **SLAPP risk & libel costs**: even with new anti-SLAPP provisions (narrow, economic-crime scope), UK litigation remains a chilling, expensive threat. Many investigations die in legal review. citeturn5search0turn5search18
- **FOI obstacles**: years of complaints about the Cabinet Office “Clearing House,” slower responses, enforcement actions and backlogs—all of which **push journalists toward easier sources** than months-long FOI battles. citeturn9search0turn9search10turn9search11

## 6) Audiences moved; PSBs can’t offset it alone

- UK audiences now get news **online as much as on TV**; social media is used by **\~52%** for news. The BBC/ITV/C4 remain highly used and trusted—but they can’t carry commercial investigative capacity for everyone else. citeturn0search1
- **News avoidance** is rising (UK c. mid-40s%). That pushes commissioners toward packaging that can still break through—again favouring high-arousal, low-friction stories. citeturn0news50

## 7) Labour market precarity narrows who can do deep work

- Many UK freelances report **median journalism income \~£17.5k**, below a full-time minimum-wage equivalent. That means less time to FOI, verify, and lawyer a piece—more need to file fast. citeturn6search4turn6search6

---

## So… why don’t “they” just do better?

Because the **dominant system rewards the opposite behaviours**:

- **Revenue**: programmatic CPMs and platform volatility mean page views *today* keep the lights on; a three-week investigation often doesn’t. citeturn0search9turn2search0
- **Distribution**: platforms amplify **short, emotional, negative** content; in practice, that dictates newsroom bets. citeturn8search0turn2search2
- **Capacity**: fewer reporters + centralised hubs = **higher story quotas, thinner shoe-leather**. citeturn6search7
- **Risk**: legal exposure + FOI drag = **high fixed costs** per proper investigation. citeturn5search18turn9search0

This doesn’t absolve weak journalism—but it explains why even good people end up shipping **fast, iterative, low-originality** stories.

---

## What changes the incentives (pragmatically)?

- **Platform reality**: plan as if social referrals keep shrinking; shift toward direct relationships (email, apps, member communities). (That’s where many UK outlets are heading.) citeturn2search14
- **Policy levers**: fully-fledged anti-SLAPP (beyond economic crime); FOI performance enforcement; targeted public-interest journalism funds (Cairncross-style). citeturn0search7turn0search12
- **Business model**: fewer commodity posts, more *must-read* beats that earn **subscriptions or philanthropy**; accept lower volume, higher value. (Plenty of evidence that volume-churn is a Red Queen’s race.) citeturn0search15
- **Editorial**: commission for **impact over clicks**; measure **saves, dwell, return reads**; pilot constructive/solutions formats where appropriate (mixed evidence, but promising in niches). citeturn8search10

#### You:
going back to the OSA (Online Safety Act), as a thought experiment, apportion 'blame' (more like accountability) as a percentage to individual ministers and actions. Where expressly collective (like voting to pass it), where all individuals each did their part along its entire timeline. It doesn't have to be perfect, I'm just using it to hang a 'who did this' type sub-section on.

#### ChatGPT:
Great, let’s treat this like a thought-experiment accountability matrix. Obviously you can’t reduce a multi-year, multi-actor process to precise maths, but assigning **illustrative percentages** can help readers see where responsibility lies. I’ll sketch it as a rough apportionment across **key ministers, parties, and phases** in the Online Safety Act (OSA) timeline.

---

# **Accountability Breakdown: Who Drove the Online Safety Act?**

### **Conservative Government (2017–2023): \~70% of responsibility**

The OSA was conceived, drafted, and pushed through under the Conservatives.

- **Theresa May (PM, 2016–2019)** – *10%*
  - Launched the **2017 Digital Economy Act** (failed porn AV scheme) and commissioned the **2019 Online Harms White Paper**, the root of the OSA.

- **Oliver Dowden (DCMS Sec., 2020–2021)** – *5%*
  - Oversaw the policy in its preparatory phase, but reportedly urged delay (“kick it into the long grass”). Responsibility more for inaction than action.

- **Nadine Dorries (DCMS Sec., 2021–2022)** – *25%*
  - **Introduced the Bill in March 2022**.
  - Championed child-safety framing, added “priority illegal offences” (revenge porn, suicide facilitation, hate crime).
  - Pushed to accelerate despite Cabinet resistance.

- **Chris Philp (Digital Minister, 2021–2022)** – *10%*
  - Expanded the Bill to cover **commercial porn sites** (not just social media).

- **Rishi Sunak (PM from Oct 2022)** – *10%*
  - Kept the Bill alive through political turmoil.
  - Accepted dropping “legal but harmful” duties under pressure (seen as watering down).
  - Announced September 2023 clarification on encryption powers (they wouldn’t be enforced until “technically feasible”).

- **Michelle Donelan (Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, 2022–2023)** – *7%*
  - **Formally introduced the Online Safety Bill in the Commons in 2023**.
  - Steered it to Royal Assent in **Oct 2023**.

- **Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay (DCMS/Lords minister)** – *3%*
  - Managed the Bill’s passage through the House of Lords.

### **Labour (Opposition 2019–2024; Government from Jul 2024): \~20%**

Labour could have opposed more strongly, or amended more radically. Instead, they chose to support and later accelerate.

- **Labour Front Bench (esp. Lucy Powell, Shadow DCMS; later Peter Kyle as Sec of State)** – *15%*
  - In opposition: **explicitly backed the principle of the Bill**, arguing “Labour supports the principles” (Hansard, Sept 2023).
  - Claimed credit for securing some amendments (e.g. journalist protections, transparency).
  - In government (2024–25): prioritised **fast-track implementation**, laying Ofcom codes (Dec 2024, Apr 2025) and pushing “safety by design.”

- **Keir Starmer (Leader of Opposition → PM from Jul 2024)** – *5%*
  - Approved manifesto commitment to “**build on the OSA** and implement swiftly.”
  - As PM, chose not to reopen or repeal, despite critiques—signalling political ownership.

### **Cross-Party Parliamentarians & Committees: \~5%**

- MPs/Lords across parties scrutinised, but the **bill passed with broad cross-party support**.
- Select committees and backbench MPs influenced specific changes (e.g., removal of “legal but harmful” clause, tweaks on journalist protections).
- Their collective role was to **legitimize** the Bill and smooth passage, rather than drive its core agenda.

### **Civil Society & Advocacy Pressure: \~5%**

- **Baroness Beeban Kidron** and the **5Rights Foundation** campaigned for children’s online protections.
- Bereaved parents (e.g. **Molly Russell’s family**) gave powerful testimony, shaping the child-safety focus.
- These voices didn’t draft legislation, but **made delay politically impossible**.

## **Interpretive note**

- **Conservatives own the architecture** (70%): they authored, expanded, and legislated the Act.
- **Labour owns the execution** (20%): they campaigned on accelerating it and pressed Ofcom to enforce fast.
- **Cross-party MPs and campaigners (10%)** provided the pressure and legitimacy that made it harder to resist.

So: the OSA isn’t *just* a Tory overreach foisted on Labour. It’s a **five-year, cross-party project**, with Labour consciously choosing to inherit and deliver it. That’s why critics who say “this is all on Labour now” aren’t entirely wrong—but they’re also ignoring the Conservative origin and the structural pressure to “do something” about online harms.

Do you want me to integrate this **“accountability matrix” as a sidebar** into your OSA timeline document, so it’s visually clear who did what and when?


#### You:
so revenge-porn being illegal made it into the OSA, or was it already covered?

#### ChatGPT:
Good question — the detail matters here.

### Before the OSA

- **Revenge porn (disclosing private sexual images without consent)** was already a criminal offence in England & Wales under the **Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015** (Section 33, “Disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress”). Scotland and Northern Ireland later passed their own laws.
- So the *existence* of a revenge-porn law pre-dated the Online Safety Bill/Act.

### What the OSA did

- In 2022, under **Nadine Dorries** as DCMS Secretary, the government announced it would **add “priority illegal content” offences** into the Bill, including:
  - **revenge pornography**,
  - **extreme pornography**,
  - **encouraging or assisting suicide**,
  - **fraud** and certain hate crimes.\
    (This was explicitly flagged as a strengthening of the draft Bill.)citeturn2search4

- The **Online Safety Act 2023** doesn’t create the revenge-porn offence (that was 2015), but it **elevates it into the OSA’s regulatory framework**:
  - Platforms in scope have a **legal duty to proactively prevent users from being exposed to priority illegal content** like revenge porn, not just to remove it after a report.
  - Ofcom can fine companies up to 10% of global turnover if they don’t have effective systems to block such material.

### Bottom line

- **Revenge porn was already criminal** before the OSA.
- What the OSA did was **upgrade its status to “priority illegal” content**, forcing platforms to build proactive systems to stop it spreading (not just react if a victim complains).

This fits the broader pattern of the OSA: taking *existing criminal offences* (child abuse imagery, terrorism, hate speech, revenge porn, fraud) and embedding them into a **new regulatory duty of care** for online platforms.

Would you like me to create a **“What the OSA actually added vs what already existed” table** for your sub-report? That would neatly clarify which harms were already illegal and what the Act changes in terms of platform responsibilities.


#### You:
that table looks pretty good to me, but can you think about it a little more and make sure, those numbers seem pretty arbitrary and I'd like you to account for each item with a little more reasoning by using THINK mode.

Love this brief. Here’s a tighter, **reasoned** accountability matrix for the OSA—still a thought-experiment, but each % is tied to specific **decision rights**, **causal leverage**, and **dated actions**. Totals = **100%**.

# How I’m allocating blame/credit

I weighted four things:

1. **Formal control** (ministerial ownership of a phase);
2. **Causal impact** (would the OSA have stalled/changed without them?);
3. **Path dependence** (earlier choices that locked-in later outcomes);
4. **Delivery** (getting it over the line / into force).

## Conservative governments (architecture & passage) — **66%**

- **Nadine Dorries (DCMS Sec, 2021–22)** — **18%**\
  **Why:** She **introduced the Bill to Parliament (Mar 17, 2022)** and rewrote the politics by putting a list of **“priority illegal offences”** (incl. revenge porn, suicide facilitation, fraud) **on the face of the Bill**—the pivot that made proactive platform duties unavoidable. Without this push, the Bill could easily have slipped. citeturn4search8turn0search1

- **Oliver Dowden (DCMS Sec, 2020–21)** — **8%**\
  **Why:** He **published the draft Online Safety Bill (May 12, 2021)** and sold it as a manifesto delivery—formally moving the White Paper into a legislative project and triggering **pre-legislative scrutiny**. That made OSA a standing item on the parliamentary conveyor belt. citeturn3search2turn3search4

- **Michelle Donelan (Culture/DSIT Sec, 2022–23)** — **7%**\
  **Why:** She made the politically decisive **removal of “legal but harmful” for adults (Nov 29, 2022)**—the trade that kept the Bill alive—then stewarded it to **Royal Assent (26 Oct 2023)**. This was the settlement that converted years of drift into law. citeturn5search3turn5search9turn0search3

- **Chris Philp (Digital Economy Minister, 2021–22)** — **6%**\
  **Why:** Drove the **widening to commercial pornography sites** (not just social platforms), which later dominates user-visible enforcement (AV). A scope decision with high downstream impact. citeturn0search3

- **Rishi Sunak (PM from Oct 2022)** — **6%**\
  **Why:** He provided precious **legislative time** and accepted the **encryption “only when technically feasible”** posture that neutralised a potential kill-shot to the Bill in 2023. That choice traded controversy for passage. citeturn5search0turn5search2turn5search10

- **Theresa May (PM 2016–19)** — **6%**\
  **Why:** Set the **policy DNA**: **Digital Economy Act 2017 Part 3 (porn AV)** and the **Online Harms White Paper (Apr 2019, DCMS + Home Office)**. Even though the DEA AV scheme collapsed in 2019, those choices created the **child-safety/do-something** path the OSA followed. citeturn2search6turn2search0turn3search9turn3search1

- **Jeremy Wright (DCMS Sec, 2018–19)** — **5%**\
  **Why:** **Co-authored/launched** the White Paper with Sajid Javid; framed Ofcom as regulator and “duty of care” as the model—core scaffolding the OSA ultimately used. citeturn3search9turn3search1

- **Sajid Javid (Home Sec, 2018–19)** — **4%**\
  **Why:** The **security/child-protection framing** of the White Paper was driven heavily by the Home Office—key to cross-party optics that sustained momentum. citeturn3search9

- **Damian Collins (Chair, Joint Committee on the Draft OSB 2021; later minister briefly)** — **3%**\
  **Why:** Chaired the **pre-leg scrutiny** that legitimised a toughened Bill and kept Ofcom at the centre. Those recommendations shaped the version Dorries then introduced. citeturn0search4

- **Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay (Lords minister)** — **2%**\
  **Why:** **Piloted** the Bill through the Lords—procedural but essential final-mile role. citeturn0search3

## Labour (opposition sponsorship → government delivery) — **16%**

- **Peter Kyle (Sec of State, DSIT, from Jul 2024)** — **10%**\
  **Why:** **Implementation owner.** He **laid Ofcom’s first illegal-harms codes (Dec 16, 2024)**, set categorisation thresholds, and publicly set the **mid-March 2025** risk-assessment clock and **July 2025** compliance horizon. That operational shove is why AV and child-safety duties hit the real world in 2025. citeturn1search3turn4search15turn1news20

- **Keir Starmer (LOTO → PM from Jul 2024)** — **3%**\
  **Why:** **Manifesto decision** to **“build on the OSA”** rather than reopen it, then backing DSIT to move fast once in office. Strategic ownership of delivery priority. citeturn4search1

- **Lucy Powell (Shadow DCMS, 2022–23)** — **2%**\

- **Alex Davies-Jones (Shadow Minister)** — **1%**\
  **Why:** Labour’s detailed scrutiny line—pressing on small-platform loopholes and child safety—helped stabilise cross-party support through rocky moments. citeturn1search16

## Collective Parliament & non-minister forces — **18%**

- **Conservative MPs’ votes (Commons majorities)** — **6%**\
  **Why:** Government time + reliable majorities are the sine qua non of passage. Without consistent Tory lobbies, the Bill would have died during party turbulence (2022–23). (Parliamentary process summary shows staged progress to 2023.) citeturn5search11

  **Why:** Pressure and amendments (e.g., coroners’ access post-Molly Russell) increased political cost of delay. citeturn2search7

- **Ofcom (regulator) in implementation** — **5%**\
  **Why:** **Roadmap, codes, guidance and enforcement** are what make the Act bite (or not). Ofcom’s illegal-harms and children’s codes and July 2025 go-live turned statute into reality. (You can argue this % up or down based on how strict you think the codes are.) citeturn0search5turn0news61turn0news62

## One-liners you can hang in the sub-section

- **Conservatives own the architecture (66%)**: May/Wright/Javid created the policy chassis (2017–19); Dowden/Dorries/Philp made it a live Bill and hardened the illegal-content spine; Donelan/Sunak did the deals (legal-but-harmful out; encryption “when feasible”) to get it passed in 2023. citeturn3search9turn3search4turn0search1turn5search3turn5search0

- **Labour owns delivery (16%)**: Starmer chose “build on it”, and **Peter Kyle** pushed Ofcom’s codes and commencement over the line, producing the 2025 user-visible changes (age checks, risk assessments). citeturn1search3turn4search15turn1news20

- **Parliament + system pressure (18%)**: Cross-party votes, Lords scrutiny, **Ofcom** rule-making and **bereaved families’ campaigns** made delay untenable and shaped the enforcement tempo. citeturn5search11turn0search5turn2search1

### Why these numbers aren’t arbitrary

Each % reflects (a) a dated, verifiable **decision or document**; (b) whether that act **advanced the critical path** (draft → intro → passage → codes → enforcement); and (c) the **counterfactual** (“absent this person, would the OSA likely look different / be later / not happen?”). If you want a variant, you can **swing 3–5 points** between Dorries/Donelan/Dowden/Sunak depending on how much weight you give to (i) the 2022 “priority illegal” pivot, vs (ii) 2022–23 compromises that saved the Bill, vs (iii) 2021 drafting that made OSA inevitable.

If helpful, I can drop this into a **stacked-bar graphic** for your report (phase weights along the x-axis, actors stacked within each phase), but this narrative alone should give you a solid “who did this” sidebar.


#### You:
okay great, that's much better. Now since we also want to highlight what the effects of the Online Safety Act really are (especially beyond the only bit the public really see, the privacy-intrusion of the age verification process), break out each major protection and change or or mechanism in the OSA, into a simple plain english table. Essentially we're looking to make the outcomes clear, both the known/proven and the hypothetical/forecasted. Essentially we want to know what's in it, with a focus on how it affects people, directly and indirectly, without waffling about small details.

#### ChatGPT:
Perfect. Here’s a **plain-English “what’s actually in it” table** for the Online Safety Act. It strips out the legal boilerplate and focuses on **real-world effects**—what’s already happening, what’s coming, and what it might mean for ordinary people.

| **Encryption powers (deferred)**                     | Ofcom technically has powers to require message-scanning on encrypted apps (WhatsApp, Signal) *if “technically feasible.”*                                                                                | Creates **future risk** to private messaging; not used immediately. Campaigners warn of a chilling effect.                                                                                      | Govt said (Sept 2023) won’t use powers until workable tech exists.                |
| **Fines & liability**                                | Ofcom can fine up to **10% of global revenue** or block services in the UK.                                                                                                                               | Gives teeth: even US giants can’t ignore UK rules. Potential knock-on effect: global platforms may redesign systems UK-wide.                                                                    | Active since Mar 2025.                                                            |
| **Transparency & reporting**                         | Platforms must publish annual reports on moderation, risks, and compliance.                                                                                                                               | Public and researchers get more insight into how harmful content spreads (if reports are honest).                                                                                               | Starting 2025; Ofcom reviews reports.                                             |
| **Empowered regulator (Ofcom)**                      | Ofcom gains sweeping powers: to demand data, audit systems, approve codes, issue fines, or block services.                                                                                                | Centralises online regulation in one body. Public may benefit from more consistent enforcement—but some fear Ofcom’s **“super-regulator” role** risks political capture.                        | Ofcom in enforcement phase.                                                       |

# **The Big Picture: Outcomes**

- **Already clear**:
  - **Age verification** = biggest visible change for users (privacy concern, access hurdles).
  - Platforms facing huge compliance costs → nudging them to **over-moderate**.
  - Scam/fraud ads **falling**, though not gone.

- **Likely near-term effects** (2025–26):
  - Safer environments for children (less easy porn/self-harm content).
  - More “blunt” removals → political satire, activism, or sexual content flagged incorrectly.
  - Privacy vs. protection debate intensifies around AV and encryption.

- **Longer-term forecast**:
  - UK could set a **regulatory template** other countries borrow.
  - Ofcom’s role will grow, but trust in the regulator will be constantly tested.
  - Public perception may lag: many people may still mostly **feel the intrusions (ID checks, takedowns)** more than the protections.

👉 Do you want me to produce a **“what existed before vs what OSA adds” companion table** (like we sketched with revenge porn) so it’s clear which harms were already illegal, and what’s actually new? That might sharpen the “this isn’t all new law, it’s new duties for platforms” message.
