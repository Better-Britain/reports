Hyde mocks the repetitive framing of Starmer's decisions as a triumph of \"grownups,\" comparing the government’s constant reboots to a bleak, forgettable movie without a clear direction. Darren Jones’ appointment as \"chief secretary to the prime minister\" serves as a symbol, for Hyde, of superficial change with little actual impact.\n\nHyde criticizes the government’s lack of legislative output and indecisive leadership, highlighting repeated U-turns and communication missteps. She focuses heavily on Starmer’s and Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ economic pledges, accusing them of indulging in “cakeism”—promising better public services without raising taxes, a formula now proven unsustainable. Hyde argues that broken promises are sowing public distrust, drawing parallels to past leaders like Boris Johnson and warning that such populist evasions could further erode political credibility.\n\nUltimately, Hyde suggests that all current major political parties are complicit in misleading the public, promoting illusionary fiscal policies that may lead the UK into deeper disillusionment unless genuine honesty becomes politically viable.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756815890,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/02/cooper-reeves-starmer-green-party-leader-badenoch-devolution-latest-updates","title":"Asylum seekers could be housed in 'modular buildings on industrial sites' when hotels close, No 10 says - as it happened","snippet":"On September 2, 2025, political developments in the UK featured prominently across various issues. Zack Polanski was elected leader of the Green Party of England and Wales with a substantial mandate. He emphasized bold left-wing policies, including public ownership of utilities, support for marginalised groups, and opposition to Labour’s centrist stance, stating the Greens aim to replace Labour. Polanski also criticised Donald Trump, dubbing him a \"fascist,\" and questioned continued NATO allegiance under his renewed presidency.\n\nMeanwhile, the government is considering housing asylum seekers in modular units on industrial estates as hotel accommodation is phased out. Plans are also underway to deport foreign students who overstay their visas, following warnings of asylum misuse.\n\nIn the Commons, a new devolution bill aims to centralize local governance, while criticism mounts over Labour’s approach, with Conservatives calling it a scheme for \"puppet mayors.\" Elsewhere, Kemi Badenoch pledged to support North Sea oil extraction and rolled back rules limiting fossil fuel export credit support. Safeguarding efforts were bolstered with the review of 1,273 closed child grooming cases amid a broader statutory inquiry.\n\nAdditionally, the Liberal Democrats, led by Ed Davey, vowed to boycott a banquet for Donald Trump, while Reform UK leader Nigel Farage protested his exclusion from the event.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756831722,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/12/labour-postpones-long-awaited-industrial-strategy","title":"Labour will not release long-awaited industrial strategy ...","snippet":"Feb 12, 2025 — Labour's long-awaited industrial strategy will not now be published until June, while ministers will bring forward plans for individual sectors.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1739404851,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/14/starmer-walks-fine-line-between-needs-of-big-business-and-those-of-working-people","title":"Starmer walks fine line between needs of big business and ...","snippet":"Oct 13, 2024 — There is discomfort in Labour's ranks over way forward as PM prepares to welcome powerful financiers to London investment summit.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1728860466,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/keir-starmer-five-pledges-labour-prime-minister-n9hm80cz2","title":"Starmer scraps flagship mission unit as part of latest reset","snippet":"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has scrapped the Mission Delivery Unit, originally established to implement his five flagship missions—economic growth, clean energy, and NHS reform—as part of a broader government reset. This restructuring reflects a shift toward a more streamlined focus on three main priorities: improving living standards, NHS performance, and national and community security. The move is seen as a response to political challenges from Reform UK and aims to simplify communication of priorities to voters.\n\nThe disbanded unit, formerly led by Clara Swinson, will be integrated into a new Downing Street delivery unit overseen by Darren Jones, who becomes chief secretary to the prime minister. Jones is expected to leverage No 10's data science team to track policy progress in real-time. Meanwhile, policy development has been centralized under Vidhya Alekeson, with civil servants increasingly sidelined. Despite speculation, Downing Street insisted that the original missions and the “Plan for Change” remain in place, with delivery simply being restructured.\n\nCritics caution the new unit may lack experienced personnel and clarity in command structure, while experts commend Jones’s oversight and cross-governmental reach but note the need for clearer roles and accountability within No 10.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756827603,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"assets.publishing.service.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67407bad53373262c0d825f6/List_of_Ministers__Interests.pdf","title":"List of Ministers' Interests - November 2024","snippet":"Nov 6, 2024 — The Rt Hon Sir Keir Starmer KCB KC MP, Prime Minister, First Lord of the Treasury, ...

This restructuring reflects a shift toward a more streamlined focus on three main priorities: improving living standards, NHS performance, and national and community security. The move is seen as a response to political challenges from Reform UK and aims to simplify communication of priorities to voters.\n\nThe disbanded unit, formerly led by Clara Swinson, will be integrated into a new Downing Street delivery unit overseen by Darren Jones, who becomes chief secretary to the prime minister. Jones is expected to leverage No 10's data science team to track policy progress in real-time. Meanwhile, policy development has been centralized under Vidhya Alekeson, with civil servants increasingly sidelined. Despite speculation, Downing Street insisted that the original missions and the “Plan for Change” remain in place, with delivery simply being restructured.\n\nCritics caution the new unit may lack experienced personnel and clarity in command structure, while experts commend Jones’s oversight and cross-governmental reach but note the need for clearer roles and accountability within No 10.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756827603,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/02/starmer-lords-peerage-politics-parliament","title":"Keir Starmer to release new peerage list in attempt to bolster Lords influence","snippet":"Prime Minister Keir Starmer is preparing to release a new list of peerages to strengthen Labour’s presence in the House of Lords and push through key legislative reforms, particularly the bill to eliminate hereditary peers, which has faced Conservative resistance. The new appointments will include Labour allies such as outgoing policy chief Liz Lloyd, who is set to become a minister in the upper house. This move follows a previous peerage round in December, which added two dozen Labour peers. The Conservatives currently outnumber Labour in the Lords, even after the potential removal of 44 Tory hereditary peers, prompting No 10 to consider appointing enough new peers to balance the composition.\n\nThis political reshuffle also reflects broader changes within Starmer’s administration. Lloyd's departure was part of a structural overhaul aimed at enhancing Downing Street’s role in economic policymaking, particularly with a challenging fiscal environment ahead of the budget. New roles were created for Darren Jones and Minouche Shafik as deputy overseeing delivery and chief economic adviser, respectively. The restructuring began after the May local elections and culminated in July, with key staff like Stuart Ingham also changing roles.

Hyde mocks the repetitive framing of Starmer's decisions as a triumph of \"grownups,\" comparing the government’s constant reboots to a bleak, forgettable movie without a clear direction. Darren Jones’ appointment as \"chief secretary to the prime minister\" serves as a symbol, for Hyde, of superficial change with little actual impact.\n\nHyde criticizes the government’s lack of legislative output and indecisive leadership, highlighting repeated U-turns and communication missteps. She focuses heavily on Starmer’s and Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ economic pledges, accusing them of indulging in “cakeism”—promising better public services without raising taxes, a formula now proven unsustainable. Hyde argues that broken promises are sowing public distrust, drawing parallels to past leaders like Boris Johnson and warning that such populist evasions could further erode political credibility.\n\nUltimately, Hyde suggests that all current major political parties are complicit in misleading the public, promoting illusionary fiscal policies that may lead the UK into deeper disillusionment unless genuine honesty becomes politically viable.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756815890,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/11/rachel-reeves-to-announce-economic-advisory-council-to-boost-uk-growth","title":"Rachel Reeves to announce economic advisory council to boost UK ...","snippet":"Rachel Reeves is poised to announce the creation of a new council of economic advisers to help guide Labour's number one “national mission” of expanding the ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1720656000,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/13/rachel-reeves-uk-productivity-economy-growth-autumn-budget","title":"Boosting productivity will be main priority of autumn budget, Reeves ...","snippet":"Boosting productivity will be main priority of autumn budget, Reeves says.

These appointments aim to reinforce economic messaging and balance Treasury influence, led by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has faced criticism over failed policy rollouts.\n\nReeves supported the staffing changes, viewing them as necessary support rather than a restriction of her authority. Additionally, former think-tank chief Torsten Bell has been brought in to assist with the upcoming Budget. While Starmer’s critics question the late timing of these changes, allies highlight the strong working relationship between him and Reeves. However, concerns remain about potential friction between Number 10 and Number 11, especially regarding policy direction.

Known for his polished PR skills and extensive political network, Allan is tasked with navigating challenges from populist figures like Nigel Farage and improving public clarity around Starmer’s vision. Despite resistance due to his company Portland’s past work with Russia and his trustee role at the gender-critical charity Sex Matters, Allan is supported by allies who highlight his non-ideological, diplomatic approach and reputation as a highly capable operator. Previously a key figure in New Labour circles, Allan built a successful PR firm and consulted for a variety of high-profile clients, including governments and corporations. While some within the Labour Party criticize the return of figures associated with corporate lobbying, many admire Allan’s experience and ability to unify teams, describing him as a “class act” with a sharp political mind tasked with strengthening Downing Street’s communication operations and conveying the prime minister’s message effectively.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756872072,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/02/starmer-lords-peerage-politics-parliament","title":"Keir Starmer to release new peerage list in attempt to bolster Lords influence","snippet":"Prime Minister Keir Starmer is preparing to release a new list of peerages to strengthen Labour’s presence in the House of Lords and push through key legislative reforms, particularly the bill to eliminate hereditary peers, which has faced Conservative resistance. The new appointments will include Labour allies such as outgoing policy chief Liz Lloyd, who is set to become a minister in the upper house. This move follows a previous peerage round in December, which added two dozen Labour peers. The Conservatives currently outnumber Labour in the Lords, even after the potential removal of 44 Tory hereditary peers, prompting No 10 to consider appointing enough new peers to balance the composition.\n\nThis political reshuffle also reflects broader changes within Starmer’s administration. Lloyd's departure was part of a structural overhaul aimed at enhancing Downing Street’s role in economic policymaking, particularly with a challenging fiscal environment ahead of the budget. New roles were created for Darren Jones and Minouche Shafik as deputy overseeing delivery and chief economic adviser, respectively. The restructuring began after the May local elections and culminated in July, with key staff like Stuart Ingham also changing roles.

This restructuring reflects a shift toward a more streamlined focus on three main priorities: improving living standards, NHS performance, and national and community security. The move is seen as a response to political challenges from Reform UK and aims to simplify communication of priorities to voters.\n\nThe disbanded unit, formerly led by Clara Swinson, will be integrated into a new Downing Street delivery unit overseen by Darren Jones, who becomes chief secretary to the prime minister. Jones is expected to leverage No 10's data science team to track policy progress in real-time. Meanwhile, policy development has been centralized under Vidhya Alekeson, with civil servants increasingly sidelined. Despite speculation, Downing Street insisted that the original missions and the “Plan for Change” remain in place, with delivery simply being restructured.\n\nCritics caution the new unit may lack experienced personnel and clarity in command structure, while experts commend Jones’s oversight and cross-governmental reach but note the need for clearer roles and accountability within No 10.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756827603,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer","title":"Keir Starmer - WikipediaSpecial adviser (United Kingdom) - WikipediaStuart Ingham - Wikipedia","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1217619398,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_10_Policy_Unit","title":"Number 10 Policy Unit","snippet":"List of Directors of the Policy Unit ; 24, Eleanor Shawcross, 2022–2024, Baroness Shawcross-Wolfson, Rishi Sunak ; 25, Stuart Ingham, 2024 - present, Keir Starmer ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1089480688,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Ingham","title":"Stuart Ingham","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1755972110,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.politicshome.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.politicshome.com/opinion/article/keir-starmer-must-provide-clarity-for-no10-reset-to-pay-off","title":"Keir Starmer must provide clarity for his No 10 reset to pay off","snippet":"3 days ago — 05 Jul 2024 ...

Labour aims to achieve the highest economic growth in the G7 through political stability and a new industrial strategy, alongside establishing a national wealth fund. \n\nThe manifesto pledges to abolish non-dom tax status, reform private school tax exemptions, expand employee rights, and enact significant changes to the NHS, including reducing waiting lists and boosting dental services. There are considerable commitments to social care reform, education, housing, and climate change, with plans to establish a clean energy grid by 2030 and build 1.5 million homes.\n\nOn immigration, Labour plans to cut net migration, scrap the Rwanda policy, and set up a border security command. In law enforcement, it pledges to increase police presence and tackle neighborhood crimes. Plans include rail renationalization and stronger environmental protection.\n\nLabour also commits to constitutional reforms like lowering the voting age to 16, removing hereditary peers' voting rights, and introducing a football governance bill.

The revenue will fund new teachers, extra NHS appointments, nurseries, mental health staff, police, and breakfast clubs. He promised no new taxes on working people.

Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan was confronted by extremist Thomas Sewell at a press conference, prompting widespread condemnation. Allan affirmed her commitment to fighting hate, while Senator Lidia Thorpe labeled the attack a hate crime and urged federal police to investigate. Three individuals, including Sewell, were arrested in connection with the assault.\n\nThe day's political discourse also featured criticism of Labor’s delay in releasing home care packages, with over 4,800 elderly Australians reportedly dying while waiting. Opposition and crossbench members threatened a procedural move in the Senate to force immediate action. Simultaneously, controversial new legislation intended to expedite the deportation of 280 former detainees to Nauru was met with scrutiny amid concerns over diminished legal fairness.\n\nOther significant events included renewed debate over net zero emissions, with Nationals Senator Matt Canavan set to introduce a bill to repeal Australia's 2050 target. Additionally, the government announced plans to regulate AI-based \"nudify\" apps and launched new guidelines for cosmetic procedures. Migration levels, ADHD prescription reform, and criticisms of MP Bob Katter's conduct also fueled discussions.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756801081,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/aug/27/conservatives-consider-deal-afghanistan-migrants-uk-politics-latest-updates-news","title":"UK politics: Tories and Reform offer only 'easy answers and snake oil' on UK-EU relationship, minister warns - as it happened","snippet":"On August 27, 2025, significant developments in UK politics centered on immigration, EU relations, and economic challenges. EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds criticized the Conservative and Reform UK parties for offering \"easy answers and snake oil\" regarding the UK-EU relationship. He specifically targeted Nigel Farage and Reform UK for proposing unrealistic immigration policies and potentially destabilizing plans, including renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement and striking deals with regimes like the Taliban.\n\nFarage drew widespread criticism after unveiling a proposal to deport up to 600,000 asylum seekers, including women and children, though he later backtracked, saying their deportation isn't planned in the next five years. Political parties in Northern Ireland condemned Farage’s remarks as reckless.\n\nIn Scotland, former Tory MSP Graham Simpson defected to Reform UK, becoming its sole MSP in Holyrood. Meanwhile, energy bills are set to rise by 2%, pushing a typical annual household bill to £1,755. The government also faces pressure over plans to halve the timeframe for asylum seekers to find housing after their claims, raising homelessness concerns.\n\nTalks with the EU on sanitary and phytosanitary standards are set for autumn, with hopes to remove costly post-Brexit licenses by 2027. Additionally, ministers approved evacuations for more Gaza students holding UK scholarships, though challenges remain.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756305841,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"assets.publishing.service.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687a3ff6312ee8a5f0806b8c/uk-labour-market-enforcement-strategy_2025-26-annex-b-large-print.pdf","title":"UK Labour Market Enforcement Strategy 2025-26: Annex B","snippet":"Jul 1, 2025 — 56 A recent MAC report: Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) annual report, 2024.

Headed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, the fund aims to align the UK Infrastructure and British Business Banks to mobilize private capital in critical sectors like green steel, hydrogen, and industrial decarbonization. While welcomed by financial experts, there are concerns about the fund's scale and political independence. Some experts suggest a more significant fund and a broader investment approach. Key figures including former Bank of England governor Mark Carney and executives from major financial institutions form a task force to guide the fund. There are calls to relax public sector pay and procurement constraints to achieve optimal results. While not a full-fledged sovereign wealth fund, this initiative aims to stimulate economic growth and meet net-zero greenhouse gas emission targets by 2050.

Countries like Norway, China, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore have long benefited from such funds. Sir Keith Skeoch, former CEO of Standard Life Aberdeen, emphasized the need for the UK to develop an equity culture and provide savers with long-term investment opportunities. Conservative MP John Penrose noted that a sovereign wealth fund would address low savings, support the welfare state, and fund business growth. Analysts suggested using proceeds from government share sales to seed the fund, potentially supporting private sector investment in energy transition. Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, also plans to create a national wealth fund, backed by over £7bn, to transition to green energy and create jobs. However, Skeoch cautioned about the time required to build impactful fund levels, suggesting it could take 20-30 years to match the world's top sovereign wealth funds. The fund should have a broad investment mandate to maximize its impact.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1716159600,"attribution":"www.fnlondon.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b7c3900fa4800baec9b2b50da74d1d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for National Wealth Fund Taskforce details","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97927cf938b6ae4b-ZRH","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"ce89556d-cf1a-4555-a2b8-760357f1d5aa","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ce89556d-cf1a-4555-a2b8-760357f1d5aa","children":["9303fd46-00c5-44ac-bb23-50582180c62b"]},"9303fd46-00c5-44ac-bb23-50582180c62b":{"id":"9303fd46-00c5-44ac-bb23-50582180c62b","message":{"id":"9303fd46-00c5-44ac-bb23-50582180c62b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756873686.587853,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Identifying Advisory Roles","content":"The key advisory bodies include the Industrial Strategy Advisory Council, the National Wealth Fund Taskforce, and the Economic Advisory Council.

The CCC highlights that high electricity costs—nearly four times that of gas—are the worst in Europe and impede the adoption of heat pumps and electric cars. This price disparity arises in part from levies on electricity bills that fund renewable energy and social programs. The CCC had previously recommended shifting these levies to gas bills or general taxation to make electricity more affordable. Despite promises from previous governments, no changes have been implemented. The Institute for Fiscal Studies echoed the CCC's concerns, stating that the current tax system disproportionately burdens electricity, hindering the transition to net zero emissions. Although Miliband defended the government’s broader climate progress—citing a 2.5% drop in carbon emissions and advancements in clean energy—he acknowledged the need for further action. Meanwhile, rising aviation emissions and stagnant progress on key recommendations like electricity pricing pose ongoing challenges to the UK’s climate goals.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1750806060,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/12/reeves-review-shows-labour-plans-to-take-on-the-right-over-net-zero","title":"Reeves' review shows Labour plans to take on the right over net zero","snippet":"Rachel Reeves' latest spending review signals Labour's commitment to aggressive climate policy and positions it in stark contrast to the Reform Party and the Conservatives on the issue of net zero. With more than £60 billion allocated to the green economy—excluding an additional £22 billion in research and development—this marks a historic investment targeting home insulation, nuclear energy, public transport, and green technology. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero received a 16% budget increase, the highest among government departments. Key pledges, such as £13.2 billion for home insulation and £8.3 billion for Great British Energy, remain intact. An additional £15 billion will support public transport outside London. However, the inclusion of £17.3 billion for nuclear power drew criticism from environmental advocates who also lamented insufficient spending on nature protections and overseas climate aid. While flood defence funding was modestly increased and agricultural subsidies preserved more than expected, activists argue Reeves missed an opportunity to levy taxes on major polluters and the wealthy, potentially raising £20 billion annually for further climate initiatives. As Keir Starmer reinforces net zero as core to Labour's identity, international climate leadership may be hindered by budget cuts to development aid.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1749708002,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/4f165ac3-a587-45cb-85f8-b5c0a674c7f9","title":"UK ministers consider biggest ever renewable subsidy auction","snippet":"Reino Unido planea la mayor subasta de subsidios para energía renovable en su historia, según fuentes gubernamentales.

En septiembre, el gobierno logró financiamiento para 131 proyectos de energía limpia, aumentando la capacidad energética significativa. Sin embargo, la próxima subasta de 2025 pretende ser la más grande hasta la fecha. Para alcanzar la meta de 2030, se requiere una expansión masiva de proyectos de energía renovable como la eólica y solar, así como infraestructura de transmisión eléctrica.

This restructuring reflects a shift toward a more streamlined focus on three main priorities: improving living standards, NHS performance, and national and community security. The move is seen as a response to political challenges from Reform UK and aims to simplify communication of priorities to voters.\n\nThe disbanded unit, formerly led by Clara Swinson, will be integrated into a new Downing Street delivery unit overseen by Darren Jones, who becomes chief secretary to the prime minister. Jones is expected to leverage No 10's data science team to track policy progress in real-time. Meanwhile, policy development has been centralized under Vidhya Alekeson, with civil servants increasingly sidelined. Despite speculation, Downing Street insisted that the original missions and the “Plan for Change” remain in place, with delivery simply being restructured.\n\nCritics caution the new unit may lack experienced personnel and clarity in command structure, while experts commend Jones’s oversight and cross-governmental reach but note the need for clearer roles and accountability within No 10.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756827603,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/03226829-2788-4599-8dde-17ee89123392","title":"Keir Starmer's new star players won't fix manager's strategic drift","snippet":"Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer has reorganized his Downing Street operations and government structure in response to perceived shortcomings during his first year in office.

It highlights allegations that a group tied to the party, the Labour Infrastructure Forum (LIF), offered businesses access to senior figures and policymakers through paid events, with some meetings reportedly costing up to £9,500. The LIF, operated by Bradshaw Advisory, is not required to register as a consultant lobbyist under current transparency rules due to its in-house status. Despite the group's claims of using sponsorship funds to cover costs, it has declined to disclose sponsor details or which companies were granted access, raising concerns about transparency.\n\nFurthermore, controversies have arisen due to meetings involving senior Labour officials, including Darren Jones and Jonathan Reynolds, with clients of Bradshaw Advisory. Loopholes in reporting rules allow such meetings, if deemed political rather than ministerial, to go unrecorded. The article argues for stricter regulations and comprehensive lobbying transparency to maintain public trust and prevent further scandals. It concludes that Starmer must increase oversight and openness to avoid repeating past political failures associated with lobbying secrecy.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754511929,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-exposed-labour-lif-lobbying-links-llz5v8gzr","title":"How we exposed Labour's cosy links to lobbyists","snippet":"A Times investigation has revealed the close ties between the UK Labour Party and lobbying interests through the Labour Infrastructure Forum (LIF), a group that styles itself as a think tank but has offered businesses access to policymakers through paid sponsorship packages. Founded by lobbyist Gerry McFall of Bradshaw Advisory, the LIF was launched at a Westminster event attended by key Labour figures and business leaders. The group reportedly offered private meetings with influential Labour insiders for fees as high as £7,850, with Bradshaw Advisory suggesting further lobbying services at £16,000–£17,000 per month.\n\nUndercover reporters posing as business advisors interested in UK investment were offered access to politicians and guidance on navigating government departments. The investigation uncovered a blurred line between LIF operations and lobbying by Bradshaw Advisory, including undisclosed meetings and potential pitch access through events labeled as political rather than ministerial, avoiding required transparency disclosures.\n\nThe Office of the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists and the Electoral Commission are reviewing these findings, amid broader concerns over weak lobbying laws. Critics argue existing rules are insufficient to monitor influence-peddling, with LIF's activities prompting calls for urgent lobbying reform. Labour denies formal connections with the LIF, despite the involvement of Labour MPs and peers in its advisory roles.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754410808,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/fbc0b36f-1402-47e7-b065-07ff19f0db20","title":"Lobbying firm Arden funded 1 in 10 Labour MPs","snippet":"Arden Strategies, a lobbying firm founded by former cabinet minister Jim Murphy, provided financial support to nearly 10% of Labour MPs before the UK's last general election. Arden sponsored fundraising dinners for 39 prospective Labour candidates, who were subsequently elected as MPs, costing approximately £1,200 each—below the £2,230 reporting threshold for political donations. This approach allowed Arden to establish connections with potential government ministers. The firm's activities raise questions about the adequacy of the UK's political transparency rules. Arden, which adheres to electoral laws and is registered with the Office of the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists, has a significant influence within the Labour Party. It is not accused of breaking any rules but has faced scrutiny regarding its close ties with Labour. Arden has sponsored various Labour events and made donations totaling about £20,000 since 2022. Both AstraZeneca and Deliveroo have ended their relationships with Arden.

Street shake-up: who's in and who's out at No 10","snippet":"In a significant reshuffle at 10 Downing Street ahead of Parliament’s return from recess, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has introduced major personnel changes to strengthen his grip on policy delivery, particularly concerning economic priorities. Darren Jones has been appointed chief secretary to the PM, bringing a reputation for economic discipline and progressive values. Tim Allan, a controversial figure with past lobbying ties, returns as executive director of communications. Renowned economist Minouche Shafik joins as chief economic adviser, fortifying the government’s economic leadership team.\n\nMorgan McSweeney, Starmer's top strategist credited for Labour’s election win, remains chief of staff, while loyalist Steph Driver continues as director of communications despite concerns over a perceived demotion. Longtime adviser Stuart Ingham is repositioned to provide direct strategic counsel. Vidhya Alakeson, instrumental in orchestrating the reshuffle, becomes deputy chief of staff, and Louise Casey remains an informal adviser focused on long-term social care reform.\n\nExiting No 10 are James Lyons (communications director), Liz Lloyd (policy director), and Olaf Henricson-Bell (policy unit head), reflecting efforts to address internal confusion and accelerate change. The shake-up is seen as a shift toward experienced, trusted figures with the capacity to execute Labour’s policy agenda decisively.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756740674,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thesun.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/36505228/angela-rayner-hypocrisy-lobby-sam-tarry-labour/","title":"New Angela Rayner hypocrisy storm as Deputy PM's boyfriend works for lobby group whose client got government cash boost","snippet":"Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner is embroiled in renewed controversy following revelations that her partner, former Labour MP Sam Tarry, works for lobbying firm Henham Strategy, whose client, Great South West, received a £280,000 funding boost from Rayner’s government department. This has ignited accusations of hypocrisy, given Rayner's prior criticisms of political lobbying and promises to curb the influence of lobbyists. Tarry, who was previously a Shadow Minister, is confirmed to advise Henham Strategy but reportedly not on matters related to Rayner’s housing brief.\n\nAlthough Rayner disclosed a conflict on her ministerial interests declaration, she did not name Tarry or the lobbying firm, prompting questions about transparency. Critics, including Tory chairman Kevin Hollinrake, have accused Rayner of double standards.\n\nCompounding the issue are fresh concerns over Rayner's property holdings. She reportedly owns three homes, including a £800,000 seaside flat in Hove, which she designated as her main residence—allegedly enabling her to avoid £40,000 in stamp duty. She also secured a £650,000 mortgage and put down a £150,000 deposit. Questions have been raised about whether this maneuver constitutes tax manipulation, though there is no suggestion she broke the law. Calls for an ethics probe have followed.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756587720,"attribution":"www.thesun.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/5557953a-9064-44f1-8d8f-b08d90772e05","title":"Keir Starmer announces major Downing Street shake-up","snippet":"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has executed a significant shake-up of his Downing Street team amid declining Labour poll numbers and growing public frustration with the government's pace of change. Darren Jones, previously Treasury Chief Secretary, has been appointed as Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister to lead performance in key policy areas and report directly to Starmer, signaling an effort to strengthen leadership within Number 10. Baroness Minouche Shafik, former Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, joins as Chief Economic Adviser, boosting the Prime Minister's economic authority. The moves sparked criticism from Conservatives, who accused Starmer of undermining Chancellor Rachel Reeves, though her allies claim she supported the changes.\n\nStarmer has also revamped his media team, bringing in Tim Allan, a former advisor to Tony Blair, as Executive Director of Communications, reflecting a pattern of enlisting New Labour-era veterans. The reshuffle comes ahead of an important autumn Budget and a push toward a more delivery-focused phase of governance. Key roles at the Treasury are being filled by James Murray and Dan Tomlinson, and Dan York-Smith has been named Starmer’s principal private secretary. The abrupt departures of senior aides raise questions about Starmer’s leadership and internal management.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756716760.79,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-publication-of-special-adviser-interests-2024-2025/cabinet-office-publication-of-special-adviser-interests-2024-2025-html","title":"Cabinet Office Publication of Special Adviser Interests ...","snippet":"Jul 17, 2025 — The declared interests of all those employed in the period 1 April 2024 - 31 March 2025 have been considered for publication, including those ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752764405,"attribution":"www.gov.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-publication-of-special-adviser-interests-2024-2025","title":"Cabinet Office Publication of Special Adviser Interests ...","snippet":"Jul 17, 2025 — This document shows relevant interests that Cabinet Office special advisers have declared for the 2024-2025 financial year.

Founded by lobbyist Gerry McFall of Bradshaw Advisory, the LIF was launched at a Westminster event attended by key Labour figures and business leaders. The group reportedly offered private meetings with influential Labour insiders for fees as high as £7,850, with Bradshaw Advisory suggesting further lobbying services at £16,000–£17,000 per month.\n\nUndercover reporters posing as business advisors interested in UK investment were offered access to politicians and guidance on navigating government departments. The investigation uncovered a blurred line between LIF operations and lobbying by Bradshaw Advisory, including undisclosed meetings and potential pitch access through events labeled as political rather than ministerial, avoiding required transparency disclosures.\n\nThe Office of the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists and the Electoral Commission are reviewing these findings, amid broader concerns over weak lobbying laws. Critics argue existing rules are insufficient to monitor influence-peddling, with LIF's activities prompting calls for urgent lobbying reform.

It highlights allegations that a group tied to the party, the Labour Infrastructure Forum (LIF), offered businesses access to senior figures and policymakers through paid events, with some meetings reportedly costing up to £9,500. The LIF, operated by Bradshaw Advisory, is not required to register as a consultant lobbyist under current transparency rules due to its in-house status. Despite the group's claims of using sponsorship funds to cover costs, it has declined to disclose sponsor details or which companies were granted access, raising concerns about transparency.\n\nFurthermore, controversies have arisen due to meetings involving senior Labour officials, including Darren Jones and Jonathan Reynolds, with clients of Bradshaw Advisory. Loopholes in reporting rules allow such meetings, if deemed political rather than ministerial, to go unrecorded. The article argues for stricter regulations and comprehensive lobbying transparency to maintain public trust and prevent further scandals. It concludes that Starmer must increase oversight and openness to avoid repeating past political failures associated with lobbying secrecy.","attribution":"The Times"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":15,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21},{"turn_index":15,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Times"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn15news22","start_idx":4127,"end_idx":4146,"safe_urls":["https://www.ft.com/content/fbc0b36f-1402-47e7-b065-07ff19f0db20?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/fbc0b36f-1402-47e7-b065-07ff19f0db20?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Lobbying firm Arden funded 1 in 10 Labour MPs","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/fbc0b36f-1402-47e7-b065-07ff19f0db20?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1728360009.277,"snippet":"Arden Strategies, a lobbying firm founded by former cabinet minister Jim Murphy, provided financial support to nearly 10% of Labour MPs before the UK's last general election. Arden sponsored fundraising dinners for 39 prospective Labour candidates, who were subsequently elected as MPs, costing approximately £1,200 each—below the £2,230 reporting threshold for political donations. This approach allowed Arden to establish connections with potential government ministers. The firm's activities raise questions about the adequacy of the UK's political transparency rules. Arden, which adheres to electoral laws and is registered with the Office of the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists, has a significant influence within the Labour Party. It is not accused of breaking any rules but has faced scrutiny regarding its close ties with Labour. Arden has sponsored various Labour events and made donations totaling about £20,000 since 2022. Both AstraZeneca and Deliveroo have ended their relationships with Arden.

Starmer emphasizes fiscal discipline and professionalism in government, aiming to show Labour as aligned with broad public interests (what he calls a “national *purpose*” rather than ideological purity【3†L166-L174】【3†L170-L178】). As PM, he is the ultimate policy decision-maker, but he often centralizes decisions through his close advisory team (taking “direct control” of key policy delivery)【1†L177-L184】【1†L191-L199】. *(Influence: Highest – the agenda setter)*\n\n- **Angela Rayner (Deputy Prime Minister)** – Starmer’s deputy and a prominent voice from Labour’s working-class *soft left*. Now Deputy PM (and holding a substantial brief, such as Levelling Up or similar domestic policy coordination), Rayner provides a link to Labour’s grassroots and union base. She has been a key figure in balancing the party’s appeal to its traditional Northern, working-class supporters. While Starmer has tightened his inner circle control, Rayner’s influence comes through her public visibility and focus on “social justice” issues, ensuring policies like renters’ rights and worker protections stay on the agenda【11†L52-L60】. *(Influence: Moderate – publicly visible, but not driving core strategy)*\n\n- **Rachel Reeves (Chancellor of the Exchequer)** – As the second most powerful minister, Reeves steers economic policy. A former Bank of England economist, she champions a pro-business but *“muscular”* state approach (e.g. a green industrial strategy) and has vowed to restore fiscal credibility【35†L223-L231】. Early in the term, Reeves had significant autonomy – effectively shaping both economic *and* domestic policy while Starmer focused on foreign affairs【9†L253-L261】. However, facing criticism over a slow economic agenda, Starmer has recently moved to **dilute the Treasury’s power** and bring economic strategy closer to No.10【9†L226-L234】【9†L252-L260】. He installed his own Chief Economic Adviser and shifted a key deputy (Darren Jones) into No.10, signaling that Reeves’s influence, while still significant, is now balanced by direct PM oversight【9†L226-L234】【9†L300-L308】. *(Influence: High – key economic decision-maker, though now under closer PM supervision)*\n\n- **David Lammy (Foreign Secretary)** – As Foreign Secretary, Lammy shapes UK foreign policy and international relations. A senior Black British MP, he brings an emphasis on human rights and rebuilding European ties post-Brexit. Lammy is a close ally of Starmer and often defends government positions robustly (famously justifying Starmer’s need for donor support by saying leaders must “look their best” representing Britain【3†L187-L195】【3†L198-L205】). His influence on domestic policy is limited, but he is central to decisions on diplomacy, defense (working with John Healey, Defence Secretary), and international development. *(Influence: Moderate – strong voice in foreign affairs, minimal in domestic policy)*\n\n- **Yvette Cooper (Home Secretary)** – A former Cabinet minister, Cooper handles home affairs (policing, immigration, security). Known for her experience and centrist stance, she influences policy on crime and migration. She provides a firm hand on law-and-order issues, aligning with Starmer’s promise to be tough but fair (e.g. she’s likely behind plans for balanced asylum rules and community policing). *(Influence: Moderate)*\n\n- **Pat McFadden (Minister for the Cabinet Office)** – A veteran of the Blair/Brown years, McFadden has emerged as a **key fixer** in Starmer’s government. He initially served as Shadow Cabinet Office minister and was Starmer’s campaign coordinator in 2023; now in government, he holds a role akin to Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, overseeing cross-government delivery and union relations【31†L129-L137】. McFadden’s proximity to Starmer (he often joins the PM in high-level meetings) and his strategic experience mean he has a strong hand in policy coordination and in “troubleshooting” government priorities. In essence, he is an **influential behind-the-scenes minister** ensuring Starmer’s directives are implemented across departments. *(Influence: High – part of the core executive team ensuring government coherence【33†L9-L17】)*\n\n*(**Note:** *Other Cabinet figures* like **John Healey** (Defence), **Shabana Mahmood** (Justice), **Wes Streeting** (Health), **Bridget Phillipson** (Education), etc., each influence policy in their domains. However, Starmer’s governance style has been to centralize decision-making in No.10. His **“core executive”** is tightly coordinated, with Starmer, McFadden, Reeves, Lammy and a few others forming a top team that drives overall strategy【33†L9-L17】. Junior ministers and backbench input exist, but major policy directions are typically set by the leadership.)*\n\n## Downing Street Inner Circle (Starmer’s Advisers)  \n- **Morgan McSweeney (Chief of Staff)** – Starmer’s chief of staff and *architect of the “Starmer project.”* McSweeney ran Starmer’s leadership campaign in 2020 and masterminded Labour’s landslide 2024 election victory【12†L55-L63】. Now as No.10 Chief of Staff, he is *“one of the PM’s closest aides”* with *“enormous influence”*, regarded as arguably the most powerful figure behind the scenes in government【12†L59-L62】. McSweeney has a background in Labour’s centrist circles – he co-founded the Labour Together network and fought far-left factions in local politics【12†L65-L73】【12†L89-L92】. Described as hard-working, strategic, and trusted by Starmer, he coordinates policy and political strategy across government. Under Starmer, No.10’s operation revolves around McSweeney’s team, especially after he **won an internal power struggle** that led to Sue Gray’s departure (see below)【11†L81-L89】. *(Influence: Tier 1 – Starmer’s right-hand man controlling the Downing St operation)*\n\n- **Sue Gray (Former Chief of Staff)** – A high-profile former civil servant (famed for the “Partygate” report), Gray was recruited as Starmer’s Chief of Staff in mid-2024 for her Whitehall expertise【11†L80-L88】. However, her tenure was **short-lived** – she left after just four months (Oct 2024) following an alleged power struggle with McSweeney【11†L81-L89】. Reports say Gray centralized decision-making “extraordinarily” tightly, which caused friction in No.10【12†L153-L161】. The clash culminated in Starmer siding with McSweeney; Gray resigned, saying intense controversy around her role had become a distraction【12†L163-L170】. Starmer did later nominate Sue Gray for a peerage, and she has since taken a seat in the House of Lords【10†L1-L8】. *(Influence: Initially high as CoS, now nil – an influential hire who was quickly sidelined)*\n\n- **Jill Cuthbertson (Deputy Chief of Staff)** – As one of two deputies to McSweeney, Cuthbertson handles day-to-day operations and government *“productivity.”* A respected former director of Starmer’s office in opposition, she is seen as a “safe pair of hands” with deep knowledge of what can go wrong in government【16†L276-L284】. Colleagues praise her as *“one of the most effective operators… highly trusted by the PM.”*【16†L281-L288】 She oversees scheduling, logistics, and ensures Starmer’s priorities are translated into action on the ground (she even had authority to cancel subpar events during campaign mode【16†L279-L287】). *(Influence: High – key executor of Starmer’s agenda, gatekeeping what reaches the PM)*\n\n- **Vidhya Alakeson (Deputy Chief of Staff)** – The other Deputy CoS, Alakeson focuses on political and policy coordination. Formerly Starmer’s director of external relations, she has a background in community development (ex-CEO of Power to Change charity) and think-tanks (ex-Resolution Foundation)【16†L292-L300】. She is known for interest in *“communitarianism and the politics of place,”* aligning with Starmer’s focus on “levelling up” forgotten regions【16†L292-L300】. Alakeson’s role is more outward-facing – building relationships with stakeholders and ensuring the government’s policy platform stays connected to voters’ real-world needs. Described as a *“doer… relational, and ambitious for the country,”* she adds strategic depth to McSweeney’s team【16†L298-L306】. *(Influence: High – shapes policy narrative and stakeholder outreach)*\n\n- **Claire Reynolds (Political Director)** – Brought into No.10 after 2024, Reynolds is a former adviser to Tony Blair and ex-Deputy Chief of Staff in Blair’s Downing St. She served as director of the Labour Women’s Network and is well-liked in Labour circles【18†L23-L30】. Now as Starmer’s Political Director, Reynolds bridges party politics and government – monitoring MPs, managing the political messaging, and advising on sensitive political decisions. Her *New Labour pedigree* (and direct line to Blair’s methods) makes her a key asset in “phase 2” of Starmer’s project【31†L133-L141】. *(Influence: Medium – important in political strategy, though not the final decision-maker)*\n\n- **Paul Ovenden (Head of Strategic Communications)** – A former journalist, Ovenden oversees political messaging and media strategy (he replaced Morgan McSweeney in this role when McSweeney became CoS)【18†L19-L27】. He had been Starmer’s head of attack/rebuttal in opposition and is skilled in media relations. Ovenden ensures that government policy is packaged in a voter-friendly way and coordinates announcements across departments. *(Influence: Medium)*\n\n- **Matthew Doyle and James Lyons (Communications)** – *Doyle* was Starmer’s Communications Director (having been Tony Blair’s former spin doctor) but **stepped down in March 2025** amid criticism of Labour’s media strategy【11†L99-L107】. He was replaced by a new setup: *James Lyons*, a former journalist, became Director of Strategic Communications, and *Steph Driver* became Deputy Communications Director【11†L107-L115】【18†L49-L57】. Lyons, another ex-media veteran, was tasked with sharpening No.10’s message discipline (he was known for social media savvy, coming from a role at TikTok’s comms team)【18†L55-L60】. However, Lyons **departed after a year** in a 2025 shake-up, as Starmer again reset his media operation【9†L263-L271】. These changes reflect Starmer’s willingness to overhaul communications to better “sell” policy. *(Influence: Medium – they shape *how* policies are communicated; direct policy influence is lower)*\n\n- **Stuart Ingham & Ravinder “Rav” Athwal (Policy Unit)** – Ingham (an Oxford academic-turned-adviser) and Athwal (an economist who worked at HMT) are key figures in Starmer’s No.10 Policy Unit【18†L31-L39】. In opposition, Athwal was Labour’s director of policy; now in government, both he and Ingham help generate and vet policy ideas for the PM. Described as cerebral and data-driven, they ensure Starmer’s policy agenda is evidence-based and aligned with his priorities (e.g. economic growth, public service reform). They operate largely behind the scenes; their influence became more pronounced as Starmer sought to “beef up” No.10’s economic expertise by bringing in seasoned policy experts (Athwal himself came from the Treasury)【1†L177-L184】【1†L195-L203】. *(Influence: Medium – shape detailed policy options, with Starmer’s trust)*\n\n- **Darren Jones (Chief Secretary to the PM)** – Formerly a rising star MP and Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Jones was *moved into No.10* in 2025 to **oversee delivery of Starmer’s priorities**【7†L19-L27】【9†L246-L254】. In a newly created role akin to a “Chief Operating Officer” of government, he reports directly to Starmer. Jones’s appointment (dubbed Starmer’s new *“Mr Fix-it”*) is considered a *“major power move”* by Starmer to inject fresh political leadership into No.10【9†L244-L252】. He coordinates across ministries to ensure policies (from immigration to NHS reforms) are implemented on schedule and aims to break any bureaucratic silos. Given his background, Jones also provides Starmer with additional insight into Treasury workings【9†L246-L254】. *(Influence: High – a trusted coordinator for the PM, now central to policy delivery)*\n\n- **Baroness Minouche Shafik (Chief Economic Adviser)** – Appointed in late 2025, Baroness Shafik is a globally renowned economist (former Deputy Governor of the Bank of England) now advising Starmer on economic policy【9†L226-L234】【9†L308-L316】. By bringing her in, Starmer signaled he wanted more direct control over economic strategy (beyond the Chancellor’s Treasury)【9†L226-L234】. Shafik’s expertise in fiscal and monetary policy provides intellectual heft to No.10’s economic plans – she champions investment in growth and productivity. Her presence slightly reduces Rachel Reeves’s unilateral influence, as Starmer can now get a second opinion on economic matters【9†L300-L308】. *(Influence: High – key economic brain advising the PM directly)*\n\n- **Others** – *Special advisers (SpAds)* in No.10 like **Sophie Nazemi (Press Secretary)**, **Alan Lockey (Speechwriter)**, and **Tom Lillywhite (Digital Director)** round out Starmer’s inner team【18†L67-L75】【18†L73-L76】. They each influence specific areas – from crafting Starmer’s speeches and online presence to handling daily press briefings. While individually lower-profile, collectively they ensure the PM is supported on all fronts. *(Influence: Low to Medium)*\n\n## “New Labour” Continuity and Elder Statesmen  \n- **Sir Tony Blair** – Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has seen a *surge in influence* on Starmer’s Labour. Once sidelined after leaving office, Blair is now something of an *elder mentor* from the wings. Starmer has openly courted Blair’s legacy of electoral success, even speaking at Blair’s **Future of Britain** conference and echoing some Blairite policy targets (e.g. a 70% home-ownership goal)【35†L259-L268】. The **Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI)**, Blair’s think tank, has *“blazed an ideological trail”* for Starmer’s government【31†L105-L113】. For example, TBI’s policy papers on AI, digital government, and technological innovation prefigured Starmer’s own tech policies (Starmer’s January 2025 AI strategy closely mirrored TBI’s prior recommendations on data and AI infrastructure【31†L109-L118】【31†L115-L123】). Blair himself has advised Starmer informally; media describe Blair as potentially *“more powerful in 2023 than during his premiership,”* given Starmer’s adoption of many of his centrist approaches【30†L427-L435】. *(Influence: High – indirectly through ideas and personnel; he’s a lodestar for Starmer on modernization and election-winning strategy【31†L99-L107】【31†L127-L134】.)*\n\n- **Tony Blair Institute (TBI)** – This think tank (founded by Blair) provides a steady stream of centrist, technocratic policy ideas. Its mission is to *“revitalise the centre ground”* and equip leaders with solutions on tech, governance and security【30†L328-L336】【30†L330-L338】. TBI’s influence on Starmer-era Labour is widely acknowledged: it has been called an *“incubator”* of Starmer’s manifesto and is seen as *highly influential* on Labour policy【21†L151-L158】. Notably, TBI has staff directly bridging to Labour – for instance, its Future of Britain policy director, **Jeegar Kakkad**, also serves as a part-time strategic adviser to Labour on tech and R&D【35†L269-L277】. The overlap in agenda (pro-growth, pro-technology, anti-populist centrism) means TBI’s proposals often find a warm reception in Starmer’s No.10. *(Influence: High – a key source of policy frameworks and talent for Starmer’s government)*\n\n- **Lord *Peter Mandelson*** – Architect of New Labour’s messaging in the 1990s, Mandelson has Starmer’s ear as an unofficial advisor. He was a vocal supporter of Starmer’s leadership bid and remains an advocate for business-friendly policies. In a symbolic move, Starmer appointed Mandelson as **Britain’s Ambassador to the United States in late 2024**, underscoring trust in Mandelson’s strategic skills【31†L133-L141】. Mandelson’s influence is twofold: behind the scenes, he counsels Starmer on strategy and international outlook; in Washington, he now represents Starmer’s government, strengthening US-UK ties and presumably advocating the pro-trade, pro-tech agenda that both he and Blair champion. *(Influence: Medium-High – mostly behind the scenes, shaping strategy and international positioning)*\n\n- **Jonathan Powell** – Former Chief of Staff to Tony Blair, Powell was brought in by Starmer as his **National Security Adviser** in late 2024【31†L133-L141】. This unprecedented appointment of a political NSAdvisor indicates Starmer’s desire to inject experienced strategic thinking into security and foreign policy. Powell coordinates security, defense and intelligence policy for Starmer, applying lessons from the Blair era (when he was instrumental in Northern Ireland peace negotiations). His influence ensures that Starmer’s foreign/security decisions (from AUKUS defense plans to handling of crises) are informed by someone who has “seen it all” in government. *(Influence: Medium – niche to security/foreign affairs, but strong trust from PM)*\n\n- **Gordon Brown** – Another former Labour PM, Brown has shaped Starmer’s thinking on constitutional and economic reforms. In 2020 Starmer *commissioned Brown to lead* the **Commission on the UK’s Future**, to recommend how to “settle the future of the union” and devolve power【41†L5-L13】. Brown’s report (published late 2022) made 40 recommendations, notably proposing to **abolish the House of Lords** and replace it with an elected chamber, alongside sweeping devolution of power and measures to *“end the undue influence of wealth and foreign money”* in politics【42†L202-L210】【42†L204-L212】. Starmer enthusiastically endorsed the vision – appearing with Brown to launch it – though implementation is pending consultation【42†L187-L195】【42†L212-L220】. Brown’s advocacy for economic decentralization and higher public integrity standards aligns with Starmer’s pledge to “spread power and opportunity” beyond Westminster【42†L197-L205】【42†L231-L239】. While Brown holds no formal role, his blueprint for governance is poised to influence Labour’s manifesto and first-term agenda (Starmer has *“committed to replacing the Lords with an elected chamber”* in principle【41†L27-L32】). *(Influence: Medium – intellectual and moral influence on long-term reforms; not involved in day-to-day government)*\n\n- **Ed Miliband** – Starmer’s predecessor as Labour leader (2010–15), now serving in Starmer’s Cabinet (Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero). Miliband’s influence lies in policy areas like **climate change, energy, and inequality**, which he’s long championed. He spearheaded Labour’s Green Prosperity Plan and the £28bn/year climate investment pledge (though Starmer later slowed the timeline amid economic pressures). As a prominent left-leaning voice in Cabinet, Miliband represents the party’s social-democratic tradition. His presence assures Labour’s base that bold action on climate and social justice remains on the table, even as Starmer positions the party towards the center. *(Influence: Medium – subject-matter influence on climate/energy policy; ideologically keeps the government slightly left-of-center)*\n\n- **Other New Labour alumni**: Starmer has also welcomed figures like **Pat McFadden** and **Deborah Mattinson (Baroness Mattinson)** into his orbit, who bridge past and present. McFadden (covered above as a minister) was a Blair-era adviser, and Mattinson was Gordon Brown’s pollster who later became Starmer’s Director of Strategy in opposition (she crafted the “hero voter” concept focusing on target voters). Mattinson left the leader’s office after the 2024 election and was elevated to the Lords【19†L9-L17】【19†L19-L27】, but her research helped define Starmer’s election pitch to the “Red Wall” and middle England. These links to Labour’s past successes have provided Starmer’s team with institutional memory and strategic savvy. *(Influence: Medium (collectively) – ensure Starmer’s policies are informed by lessons from prior Labour governments)*\n\n## Labour’s Think-Tanks and Policy Networks  \n- **Labour Together** – Often described as Starmer’s *“in-house think tank,”* Labour Together is a network closely associated with his team【3†L171-L179】. Founded in 2015, it evolved from a cross-faction Labour project into an overtly political think tank fueling Starmer’s policy development【35†L175-L183】【35†L179-L187】. It conducts polling and policy research to identify what it will take for Labour to win and retain power. In fact, *“it is regarded by The Guardian, Politico, The Times, and others as a highly influential group upon the Starmer-led Labour Party,”* seen as an incubator for Labour’s 2024 manifesto ideas【21†L151-L158】. Labour Together’s director, Josh Simons (a data expert and former Corbyn aide who turned critic), and research lead Christabel Cooper focus on voter-centric policy design – for example, segmenting target voters as “Workington Man” and “Stevenage Woman” to tailor policies【35†L183-L192】【35†L193-L201】. The think tank stays tightly aligned with Starmer’s office: *“We’re not doing things that we don’t think will help the leadership… we want to make a case for the politics that can win”* said one of its leads【35†L199-L207】【35†L209-L217】. Labour Together even placed some of its staff into government roles after the election【3†L171-L179】. In summary, it provides Starmer with data-driven policy blueprints and has an **explicit mandate to keep Labour’s platform electable**. *(Influence: Very High – shapes Labour’s strategic policy direction and was instrumental in Starmer’s campaign and transition to power【21†L143-L151】【21†L151-L158】.)*\n\n- **Progressive Britain** – A centre-left policy platform “rooted in the Labour Party,” formed from the merger of Blair-era groups (Progress and Policy Network). It bills itself as *“the new platform for policymaking, political education and imaginative thinking to rebuild Labour and the nation,”* dedicated to intellectually revitalizing the centre-left【25†L48-L56】. Progressive Britain works closely with Labour ministers and thinkers – publishing ideas on economic reform, industrial strategy, and social policy. It hosts events and publications that often feature serving Labour politicians. The group’s Executive Director, **Adam Langleben**, and its board (which includes Labour peers like Lord Roger Liddle and former TUC leader Kay Carberry) connect the party to policy intellectuals【25†L50-L59】【25†L114-L123】. Progressive Britain essentially continues the mission of “New Labour” centrism in a 2020s context – emphasizing pro-growth economics, social liberalism, and institutional reform. Many of Starmer’s moderate policy stances (e.g. partnership with business, emphasis on national security alongside social justice) find resonance in Progressive Britain’s output. *(Influence: High – provides a pipeline of centrist policy ideas and training for Labour’s next generation【25†L50-L59】【25†L55-L62】.)*\n\n- **Fabian Society** – The Fabian Society is Labour’s oldest think tank (founded 1884) and is constitutionally affiliated to the party as a socialist society【26†L15-L18】. Historically, the Fabians’ gradualist social-democratic ideas heavily influenced Labour governments through the 20th century. *“As one of the founding organisations of the Labour Party, the Fabian Society has strongly influenced British politics,”* and today it functions primarily as a think tank and forum for policy debate within Labour【27†L230-L239】. It convenes conferences and publishes pamphlets on issues like inequality, welfare, and democratic reform – providing an ideological backbone that stresses **greater equality and collective action**【27†L222-L230】. Starmer has maintained links to the Fabians (e.g. he gave a keynote at a Fabian conference as opposition leader). While their sway on day-to-day policy is less direct than newer outfits like Labour Together, Fabian proposals (such as for *“active government”* economic policy or strengthening workers’ rights) often seep into Labour’s program via the party’s National Policy Forum. *(Influence: Medium – an enduring intellectual influence, ensuring Labour’s policies have socialist/social-democratic depth and historical continuity【27†L230-L239】【27†L236-L240】.)*\n\n- **Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR)** – An independent progressive think tank (non-partisan charity) that has long been **a key idea-generator for Labour**. IPPR was crucial under past Labour leaders (e.g. its Commission on Social Justice under David Miliband influenced New Labour in the ’90s【35†L219-L227】). Under Starmer, IPPR’s influence remains robust: *“Labour insiders confirm the IPPR’s influence on the party’s economic growth agenda, which bears the hallmarks of Bidenomics,”* i.e. higher public investment and industrial strategy【35†L223-L231】. For instance, IPPR’s Environmental Justice Commission in 2021 recommended ~£30bn annual green investment, a figure mirrored when Rachel Reeves later pledged £28bn/year for climate transition【35†L223-L231】. IPPR’s analyses on welfare, public service reform, and decentralisation have informed Labour’s stance (often providing the evidence base that Labour politicians cite). While IPPR must remain non-partisan, its researchers (like Harry Quilter-Pinner, Luke Murphy, and others) engage closely with Shadow ministers to shape “the climate of ideas” in which Labour policy is made【35†L215-L224】【35†L223-L231】. *(Influence: High – a behind-the-scenes powerhouse aligning expert policy research with Labour’s agenda.)*\n\n- **Tony Blair Institute (Tech & Global Policy)** – (Covered under Blair above) In the think-tank ecosystem, TBI stands out for its focus on technology, digital government, and globalization. Its influence is seen in Labour’s embrace of policies like digital ID, AI in healthcare, and a pro-innovation regulatory stance – all advocated by TBI. The institute’s policy chief for Future of Britain, Ryan Wain, and others like Kirsty Innes (public services) have produced papers that Starmer’s team has privately studied. Notably, *TBI even had one of its directors seconded part-time into Labour HQ (working on tech-driven growth strategy)*【35†L269-L277】. However, TBI’s big-business funded, globalist orientation has drawn some **criticism from Labour’s left**, who worry about outsized billionaire influence on Starmer【30†L427-L435】. Despite this, Starmer appears to calibrate TBI’s ideas through his labourist lens (seeking to ensure tech benefits “ordinary people”). *(Influence: High – especially on tech, modernization, and some economic reforms.)*\n\n- **Other notable think tanks**: **Resolution Foundation** (directed by Torsten Bell, ex-Starmer adviser) informs Labour’s thinking on living standards and inequality; **New Economics Foundation (NEF)** offers ideas on community wealth building and green new deals (closer to Labour’s left, with limited uptake by Starmer so far); **Social Market Foundation (SMF)** and **Centre for Cities** have contributed policy nuances on skills and regional growth adopted by Labour technocrats. Additionally, academic institutes like UCL’s **Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose** (led by Mariana Mazzucato) influenced Starmer’s talk of *“mission-driven government”* – Starmer consulted such experts for his *national missions* agenda in early 2023. While these individual sources have smaller roles, collectively they ensure Labour’s policy pipeline is stocked with ideas and research, from orthodox to radical. *(Influence: Medium (aggregate) – provide policy options and credibility, even if not all are adopted.)*\n\n## Trade Unions and Labour’s Traditional Base  \nTrade unions founded the Labour Party and remain a core influence – both formally (through party structures) and informally (through lobbying and funding). Starmer’s first year in power has seen a delicate recalibration of this relationship:\n\n- **Unite the Union (General Secretary: Sharon Graham)** – Unite is Britain’s second-largest union (1.2 million members) and Labour’s biggest affiliated union. Historically, *Unite has been the largest individual donor to the Labour Party*【38†L99-L107】. Under Sharon Graham, however, Unite has taken a more independent stance: she cut some donations to Labour HQ in 2022–23 to focus on industrial campaigns【36†L19-L27】. Even so, Unite still *“remains Labour’s largest trade union affiliate” and is “very proud to be”* linked to the party【38†L101-L107】. Graham’s influence on policy is exerted by pushing Labour on worker rights, pay raises, and renationalisation of key industries (e.g. she strongly supports rail renationalisation, which became one of Starmer’s early pledges in government【11†L52-L60】). Unite’s leverage comes from its financial support and its bloc vote at Labour’s conference (they can endorse or oppose policy motions). Starmer has been cautious to keep Unite onside – adopting popular pro-worker policies (like banning zero-hour contracts, raising the minimum wage) that align with Unite’s goals, while standing firm against union demands he deems unrealistic (creating some tension during strikes). *(Influence: High – represents Labour’s worker base; can shape or challenge Labour policy via funding and internal votes)*\n\n- **UNISON (Gen. Sec: Christina McAnea)** – The largest public sector union (1.3 million members, from nurses to council workers) and a major Labour affiliate. UNISON’s priorities (better funding for NHS, pay rises for public servants, repeal of anti-strike laws) are reflected in many Labour policy commitments. McAnea sits on Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC), giving her direct say in party governance. Her union’s influence helped push Starmer to adopt policies like paying social care workers the living wage and scrapping tuition fees (issues UNISON campaigns on). Funding-wise, UNISON contributes substantially to Labour’s coffers and sponsored dozens of Labour MPs. *(Influence: High – key in shaping public service and labor rights policies, leveraging its NEC role and financial support)*\n\n- **GMB (Gen. Sec: Gary Smith)** – A general union with strength in manufacturing and utilities. GMB is known for a pragmatic approach – for instance, it supports new nuclear energy and has backed some oil & gas projects for the sake of jobs, even when environmentalists object. This stance influenced Starmer’s nuanced position on energy transition (e.g. backing nuclear and not immediately shutting existing North Sea fields, to protect jobs). GMB also championed workers in the gig economy and pushed Labour’s pledge to give gig workers full rights. Smith has been an important ally for Starmer among unions, endorsing his leadership early on. GMB funds Labour moderately and holds significant conference votes. *(Influence: Medium – particularly on industry policy and job protection aspects of the green agenda)*\n\n- **Trades Union Congress (TUC – Gen. Sec: Paul Nowak)** – The TUC is the umbrella body for Britain’s unions. While not an affiliate per se, it coordinates union political strategy. Nowak meets regularly with Starmer and his ministers, acting as a conduit for union concerns. In Starmer’s first year, the TUC influenced the government’s **Employment Rights Bill** – many of its provisions (banning fire-and-rehire practices, boosting collective bargaining, entrenching union rights) were drawn from the TUC’s own proposals. The TUC also helped moderate industrial disputes: for example, it facilitated dialogue in rail and NHS strikes, shaping compromises that the Labour government then supported. *(Influence: Medium – provides high-level policy input on labor issues and helps maintain labour movement unity with the government)*\n\n- **Other Affiliates and Internal Bodies** – Numerous smaller unions (Unite, UNISON, GMB aside) like **Usdaw** (shop workers), **CWU** (communications), **ASLEF** (train drivers), **FBU** (firefighters) etc. feed into Labour’s policy via the Labour-union liaison structure. Socialist societies affiliated to Labour (e.g. Fabian Society, LGBT Labour, Disability Labour) each bring specific policy asks (like Fabian Women’s Network on childcare policy, or Disability Labour on social security). Labour’s **National Policy Forum (NPF)** and **NEC** include union representatives who negotiate the party’s policy program. For instance, union input was crucial in watering down proposals to cut welfare benefits – a major rebellion on welfare cuts in Starmer’s first year was backed by unions and left MPs, causing Starmer to reverse course on a planned reduction in disability benefits【11†L52-L60】. Unions collectively ensure that the voice of workers and the wider labour movement is heard in government decisions, acting as a “conscience” that can tug Labour back to its roots if it drifts too far right. *(Influence: Medium – in aggregate, they are a block that can legitimize or constrain Starmer’s policy choices)*\n\n**Overall**, under Starmer the **balance of influence has shifted** slightly: Labour is now far more reliant on **private donors** than on unions for funding (in 2023, *two individuals gave Labour more money than all unions combined*【39†L1-L4】). Starmer’s team argues this is necessary to match the well-funded Conservatives【37†L215-L223】. But this raises the question of donor influence versus union influence on policy – something Starmer must continually balance to maintain Labour’s identity. The next section details those private donor influences.\n\n## Major Donors and Financial Backers  \nThe influx of funding from wealthy individuals and businesses has become a significant facet of Labour’s first year in government. These donors often come with their own perspectives and networks, making them part of the **“power behind the power.”** We provide their profiles, official links, and an assessment of their influence:\n\n- **Lord (David) Sainsbury** – *Businessman and Philanthropist.* A former supermarket chairman, Lord Sainsbury was a key donor in the Blair era and returned to the Labour fold under Starmer. In 2023 he donated **£3.5 million** to Labour (on top of funding centrist groups like Progressive Britain)【39†L1-L9】. Sainsbury’s **official profile** is on the [House of Lords website](https://members.parliament.uk/member/1918/contact) (he sits as Lord Sainsbury of Turville). His influence is rooted in his financial support and ideological alignment: he champions science and education investment (he even served as Science Minister under Blair)【39†L7-L11】. Starmer has embraced a pro-science, pro-innovation agenda that dovetails with Sainsbury’s interests (e.g. Starmer’s plan for the UK to be a “science superpower”). Sainsbury’s donations also signal to the business community that Labour is moderate and investment-friendly. While he holds no formal role, his **access to Starmer** is notable (Starmer has met with him and other business leaders for policy discussions). *Influence guide: Very High (Tier 1 donor) –* Sainsbury’s funding and public endorsement bolster Starmer’s centrist, business-friendly strategy, and he arguably has more sway than any union now in how Labour positions itself【39†L1-L4】.\n\n- **Gary Lubner** – *Business Executive.* South African-born former CEO of Belron (Autoglass), Lubner emerged as Labour’s single biggest individual donor in the run-up to the election, giving around **£4.6 million** in 2023【40†L1-L9】. According to disclosures, Lubner began donating after meeting Rachel Reeves at a PwC dinner in 2021 and being impressed by her vision【40†L7-L10】. **Profile/Output:** Lubner does not have a public-facing profile page, but news reports and Companies House records note his philanthropy. He has said his motivation is simply to help remove the Conservatives and support a moderate, competent Labour government. Lubner’s large donations (nearly matching a quarter of Labour’s annual funding) give him informal influence – Starmer’s team will likely stay attuned to the views of such a significant benefactor. However, Lubner has not sought a public platform; there’s no indication he’s asking for policy changes in return (critics note only that *relying on wealthy donors inherently may tilt policy*, even unconsciously, towards what reassures those donors【37†L219-L227】). *Influence: High –* primarily financial leverage; he’s seen as a key part of Starmer’s election war-chest and therefore part of Labour’s new funding network, with expected continued support.\n\n- **Dale Vince** – *Green Energy Entrepreneur.* Vince is the founder of Ecotricity and a prominent environmentalist. He donated **£1 million** to Labour in 2023【39†L1-L4】, explicitly to help the party defeat the Conservatives and advance a green agenda. **Profile:** [Ecotricity’s official site](https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/) features Vince’s initiatives (like building wind parks); he’s also vocal on social media about climate action. The Conservatives attacked Labour over Vince because he had also donated to Just Stop Oil’s campaign – implying eco-activists had Starmer’s ear. Starmer flatly denied any quid pro quo, but it’s clear Vince’s support aligns with Labour’s climate policies (the £28bn green investment pledge, commitment to net-zero, etc.). Vince’s influence is that of an *ideological donor* – he’s likely to encourage bolder green policies and has publicly urged Starmer not to water down climate commitments. While not an insider, his funding and media profile make him a significant **external advocate** nudging Labour on environmental issues. *Influence: Medium –* agenda-setting influence in climate policy debates, amplified by the funding he provides and the publicity around it.\n\n- **Lord Waheed Alli** – *Media Entrepreneur and Labour Peer.* Alli has a unique place in Starmer’s circle as both a political peer and a personal friend. A long-time Labour donor (over **£700,000** given in his lifetime)【3†L179-L186】【3†L181-L189】, Alli was notable for funding Starmer’s personal image makeover: he paid for Starmer’s suits, shirts and even his eyewear, as well as some of Lady Victoria Starmer’s wardrobe【3†L177-L185】. This patronage was properly declared but drew headlines about “Keir’s donor-funded designer suits.” **Profiles:** Alli’s official [Parliament biography](https://members.parliament.uk/member/1782) lists his business interests (he co-founded Silvergate Media and was an early director of *Channel 4’s* Big Brother). Despite tabloids dubbing him Starmer’s “style advisor,” *“by all accounts, Alli is not a donor who seeks to influence party policy”*【3†L209-L216】. He is genuinely a close ally who wants Labour to succeed. Alli was even given a **temporary Downing St pass** after Starmer took office, suggesting frequent visits【3†L181-L184】. His influence is through **access and trust** – Starmer can tap Alli’s media savvy and networking (Alli is well-connected in business and LGBTQ+ advocacy). Alli also exemplifies the socially liberal, pro-diversity values of Labour’s modern coalition. *Influence: Medium –* personal confidant to Starmer; while he insists he doesn’t meddle in policy【3†L209-L216】, his proximity means his perspectives (on creative industry, minority representation, etc.) are heard. Moreover, controversies around his gifts have made Starmer sensitive to perceptions of donor influence, indirectly impacting Starmer’s push for stricter ethical rules (to *“end the undue influence of wealth”* in politics, as Gordon Brown’s report highlighted【42†L178-L186】【42†L202-L210】).\n\n- **Fran Perrin** – *Philanthropist.* Perrin (daughter of Lord Sainsbury) gave **£1 million** to Labour in 2023【39†L1-L4】. A former Blair-era No.10 aide herself, Perrin runs a foundation focused on open data and civic engagement. Her support, like her father’s, reinforces the centrist and pro-science bent in Starmer’s policy circles. She’s not public-facing politically, but her family name and donation size make her part of this list. *Influence: Low to Medium –* mainly via funding and family legacy (likely aligned with her father’s influence; not individually prominent).\n\n- **Sir Trevor Chinn** – *Businessman.* Chinn (a transport executive and philanthropist) was a significant donor to Starmer’s leadership campaign and has continued to donate to the party. He’s known for funding Labour moderates and think tanks. Chinn’s focus is on pro-Israel advocacy and entrepreneurship. Starmer has been mindful of not alienating donors like Chinn, evident in his firm stance against antisemitism and maintaining strong UK-Israel relations. *Influence: Low-Medium –* niche influence through specific policy interest (Middle East policy, business environment) and as part of the broader network of veteran Labour donors.\n\n- **Trade Union Funding vs. Private Donors:** It’s worth noting that **Labour’s reliance on private donations now dwarfs that on unions** – *“Labour’s cash from private donors now dwarfs donations from unions,”* accounting for the majority of the £21.6m raised in 2023【37†L150-L158】. In fact, just **two individuals (Sainsbury and Perrin) gave Labour more money last year than all trade unions combined**【39†L1-L4】. This marks a historic shift in who bankrolls Labour. Supporters say this frees Labour to appeal beyond its old base; critics worry it could subtly tilt Labour’s priorities towards the affluent【37†L219-L227】. Starmer has responded by emphasizing that policy will not be “for sale” and by embracing Brown’s recommendations to limit the influence of big money (e.g. banning second jobs for MPs, enforcing stricter donation transparency)【42†L202-L210】. Nonetheless, the new donor class – affluent, often London-based business figures – is now an undeniable part of Labour’s power network.\n\n---\n\n**Guide to Influence:** In summary, *Starmer’s first-year policy decisions* have been shaped by a **network of actors:**\n\n- **Inner Circle Advisers (Tier 1 influence)** – e.g. McSweeney, Alakeson, Cuthbertson – who control daily governance and strategy【12†L59-L62】【16†L281-L288】. They ensure Starmer’s will is executed and filter what information and options reach him. Their incentives align with Starmer’s success (often longtime loyalists or strategists he personally picked).\n\n- **Senior Ministers (Tier 1)** – like Reeves, who drive major policy areas (economy, etc.), albeit now somewhat checked by No.10 interventions【9†L252-L260】【9†L300-L308】. They carry weight due to their office and public profile, but Starmer has shown he will rein them in if needed to maintain “one version of the plan” in No.10【16†L205-L214】.\n\n- **“Network of Elders” and Think Tanks (Tier 2)** – heavyweights from previous eras (Blair, Brown, their institutes) and intellectual hubs (Labour Together, IPPR) that supply ideas, personnel, and legitimacy【21†L151-L158】【35†L223-L231】. These shape the **ideological narrative and long-term goals** (e.g. modernization, constitutional reform) and often have high influence on *what* policies are considered (even if not day-to-day operators).\n\n- **Trade Unions (Tier 2)** – still fundamental to Labour’s identity and governance, representing millions of workers and providing grassroots support. While their direct financial leverage has lessened【37†L150-L158】, unions influence policy on jobs, public sector pay, and workers’ rights – areas where ignoring them could trigger strikes or internal revolt (as seen in the welfare cuts debacle)【11†L52-L60】. Their alignment with “British people’s interests” is framed as keeping Labour focused on reducing inequality and improving working conditions.\n\n- **Private Donors (Tier 2)** – a newer pillar of influence, these wealthy individuals support Starmer’s vision of a competent, centrist Labour. They *softly* influence policy by reinforcing the leadership’s inclination towards fiscal moderation and pro-business growth plans (Starmer naturally wants to keep donors confident in Labour’s direction【37†L219-L227】). However, because Starmer is wary of being seen as in donors’ pockets, their influence is more *guarded* – primarily ensuring Labour does not slide back to far-left economic policies that would alienate capital. The leadership has to balance their interests (e.g. economic stability, low business taxes perhaps) with those of Labour’s base.\n\nEach of these groups and individuals comes with their **own incentives and goals**: e.g. *McSweeney* and team want a lasting Labour government (so prioritize electability and delivery)【16†L209-L218】; *Blairite think-tankers* want a technology-driven, globally engaged Britain; *unions* want secure jobs and stronger worker rights; *donors* want economic stability and a friendly business climate; *the Labour left (though diminished)* wants social justice and bold reforms. Starmer’s task has been to **align these interests** with what he defines as the “national interest” – which he pitches as ending Tory incompetence and improving living standards for the average Briton【9†L290-L299】.\n\nSo far, Starmer has managed this broad church by being pragmatic: he’ll drop or adapt policies (e.g. on welfare or green investment) if one part of the network’s pushback signals a potential breach with public opinion or party unity【9†L253-L262】【35†L223-L231】. The **influence “score”** of any actor can wax or wane with circumstances – for example, if the economy falters, Reeves and Shafik (economy team) will gain even more clout; if a major strike looms, union influence spikes; if polling dips, Labour Together’s strategists and Blairite advisors might assert more change. Starmer’s first year has shown he is willing to *“let people go”* and reshuffle roles to get the balance right【11†L55-L63】.\n\nIn conclusion, *“the people behind the power”* in Starmer’s government range from formal officials to informal confidants. We have listed their official sites or profiles where available (see citations and links above) and gauged their influence. This **accountability network** reveals a web of relationships – each node playing a part in steering policy in what Starmer hopes is the direction of *the British people’s interests*. How well each actor’s goals align with the public’s will ultimately be a judgment for voters: our guide equips readers to explore each influence further and make that assessment themselves. \n\n**Sources:** The information above is drawn from a variety of connected sources including news articles, think-tank reports, and official profiles.

digital IDs considered to crack down on illegal immigration","snippet":"The UK government, led by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, is considering mandatory digital IDs for all UK adults as a strategy to combat illegal immigration. The plan would require individuals to present digital IDs to prove legal status when applying for jobs and accessing various services. This initiative comes amid pressure from France, particularly as part of a recent migrant return agreement. Influential figures, including Sir Tony Blair and Labour MPs, support digital IDs to reduce illegal work, which is seen as a driver of Channel crossings.\n\nStarmer has taken direct control of immigration policy, emphasizing it as a key government focus. The proposed digital IDs may be used to verify eligibility not only for work but also to vote online, access healthcare, and conduct financial transactions. While the previous Labour attempt at ID cards failed due to civil liberty concerns, the current government is pressing forward, inspired partly by Estonia’s model.\n\nOther immigration control measures include closing asylum hotels, deporting international students with dubious asylum claims, and housing migrants in temporary structures on government land. Critics argue these policies may push more migrants into dangerous situations, and some Labour members had previously opposed similar Conservative policies.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756842000,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/keir-starmer-five-pledges-labour-prime-minister-n9hm80cz2","title":"Starmer scraps flagship mission unit as part of latest reset","snippet":"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has scrapped the Mission Delivery Unit, originally established to implement his five flagship missions—economic growth, clean energy, and NHS reform—as part of a broader government reset. This restructuring reflects a shift toward a more streamlined focus on three main priorities: improving living standards, NHS performance, and national and community security. The move is seen as a response to political challenges from Reform UK and aims to simplify communication of priorities to voters.\n\nThe disbanded unit, formerly led by Clara Swinson, will be integrated into a new Downing Street delivery unit overseen by Darren Jones, who becomes chief secretary to the prime minister. Jones is expected to leverage No 10's data science team to track policy progress in real-time. Meanwhile, policy development has been centralized under Vidhya Alekeson, with civil servants increasingly sidelined. Despite speculation, Downing Street insisted that the original missions and the “Plan for Change” remain in place, with delivery simply being restructured.\n\nCritics caution the new unit may lack experienced personnel and clarity in command structure, while experts commend Jones’s oversight and cross-governmental reach but note the need for clearer roles and accountability within No 10.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756827603,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/8fb84dce-f902-435b-8832-45fbc5994ace","title":"Starmer considers digital ID rollout in bid to tackle illegal migration","snippet":"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is exploring the introduction of a digital ID system to combat illegal migration and address concerns from France about the UK being attractive for irregular migrants due to lax labour enforcement. At a ministerial meeting, the initiative was discussed as part of broader efforts to tackle illicit migration, with emphasis on curbing illegal employment. This move represents a shift from Labour’s previous civil liberty concerns about ID cards. Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden recently visited Estonia to study its successful digital ID system. Though in early stages, UK officials acknowledge that digital IDs are already part of systems like e-visas and driving licences.\n\nThe government is also initiating a campaign targeting around 130,000 international students and their families, warning them against overstaying visas or making unfounded asylum claims. These steps are in response to rising immigration concerns, which have bolstered support for right-wing parties like Reform UK. Home Secretary Cooper recently paused asylum-based family reunification requests and affirmed that the UK can address immigration within the bounds of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), despite some calling for suspension from it.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756801708.357,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/peter-kyle","title":"The Rt Hon Peter Kyle MP","snippet":"Peter Kyle was appointed Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology on 5 July 2024.

Chief Executive Jean Innes stressed that the Institute needed to modernize and streamline its focus to impact real-world problems. A review by UK Research and Innovation highlighted the need for governance and leadership changes. Although there are plans to redeploy affected staff, the potential job losses have caused staff unrest. The Institute is also securing additional funds from UK defense and intelligence institutions to support its growing mission in autonomous defense.

Implemented by Ofcom, the act mandates strict safeguards against harmful content like pornography and self-harm, with noncompliant companies subject to hefty fines and potential criminal charges. Platforms must now establish robust systems, rather than target individual content, to mitigate online harm.\n\nA particularly controversial provision requires age verification for access to pornography, raising privacy concerns but demanding adherence to UK GDPR standards. Social media may also need age checks to prevent under-18s from accessing harmful content.\n\nThe legislation was spurred by public advocacy following tragedies such as the death of Molly Russell, and gains support from figures like Baroness Kidron and Rio Ferdinand. However, some critics, including the children's commissioner, argue the measures don’t go far enough, and campaigners continue to push for tougher standards, including screen time limits.\n\nDespite concerns, the UK government insists that protecting children remains a top priority, and Ofcom is actively issuing guidance and consultations. Whether the act results in a significantly safer online environment will be evaluated in the coming years.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753335266,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.itpro.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.itpro.com/business/policy-and-legislation/what-the-uks-online-safety-act-means-for-it-companies","title":"What the UK's Online Safety Act means for IT companies","snippet":"The UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA), effective from 25 July 2025, mandates digital platforms—regardless of whether they are UK-based—to implement measures that protect users, especially children, from harmful and illegal content. Enforced by Ofcom, the act introduces strict compliance provisions, including risk assessments, design accountability for algorithms, and age assurance mechanisms. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to £18 million or 10% of global turnover. Ofcom released detailed codes of practice in April 2025, giving companies until July to align with new safety standards. While designed to enhance digital safety, the act raises concerns for smaller tech firms, citing high implementation costs, lack of clarity in defining “reasonable” measures, and potentially overbroad censorship. There are also apprehensions about undermining encryption and deterring market entry into the UK and EU. Despite these challenges, advocates argue the act is a crucial step toward safer digital environments. IT firms are urged to act quickly—conduct risk assessments, understand their obligations, and embed safety into their governance structures—to ensure timely compliance and avoid regulatory penalties.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752579339,"attribution":"www.itpro.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b7c3900fa4800baec9b2b50da74d1d","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for UK Online Safety Act guidance and bodies","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"9792dacb79b7ae4b-ZRH","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"ce190bb6-8441-42cb-b883-4e8cc15391a4","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ce190bb6-8441-42cb-b883-4e8cc15391a4","children":["5ded3dcf-843f-44e9-8e1c-b3955b1f5948"]},"5ded3dcf-843f-44e9-8e1c-b3955b1f5948":{"id":"5ded3dcf-843f-44e9-8e1c-b3955b1f5948","message":{"id":"5ded3dcf-843f-44e9-8e1c-b3955b1f5948","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756877461.010057,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Summarizing key NHS and tech advisors","content":"I"}],"source_analysis_msg_id":"e3b9265d-3ddf-46b1-8c01-928de4523905"},"status":"in_progress","end_turn":false,"weight":1,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","citations":[],"content_references":[],"classifier_response":"default","skip_reasoning_title":"Skip","model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","request_id":"9792dacb79b7ae4b-ZRH","message_type":"next","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"ae8d15a6-b970-493a-b346-2799082d14ab","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ae8d15a6-b970-493a-b346-2799082d14ab","children":["3df61ac0-348a-42f2-8287-0fbbc68ac854"]},"3df61ac0-348a-42f2-8287-0fbbc68ac854":{"id":"3df61ac0-348a-42f2-8287-0fbbc68ac854","message":{"id":"3df61ac0-348a-42f2-8287-0fbbc68ac854","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756877461.13877,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"reasoning_recap","content":"Thought for 31s"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1,"metadata":{"reasoning_status":"reasoning_ended","finished_duration_sec":31,"model_slug":"gpt-5-thinking","request_id":"9792dacb79b7ae4b-ZRH","message_type":"next","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"5ded3dcf-843f-44e9-8e1c-b3955b1f5948","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5ded3dcf-843f-44e9-8e1c-b3955b1f5948","children":["c26d669f-446a-45ad-b1a2-58f5faf57bce"]},"c26d669f-446a-45ad-b1a2-58f5faf57bce":{"id":"c26d669f-446a-45ad-b1a2-58f5faf57bce","message":{"id":"c26d669f-446a-45ad-b1a2-58f5faf57bce","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756877456.574411,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Got you.

Implemented by Ofcom, the act mandates strict safeguards against harmful content like pornography and self-harm, with noncompliant companies subject to hefty fines and potential criminal charges. Platforms must now establish robust systems, rather than target individual content, to mitigate online harm.\n\nA particularly controversial provision requires age verification for access to pornography, raising privacy concerns but demanding adherence to UK GDPR standards. Social media may also need age checks to prevent under-18s from accessing harmful content.\n\nThe legislation was spurred by public advocacy following tragedies such as the death of Molly Russell, and gains support from figures like Baroness Kidron and Rio Ferdinand. However, some critics, including the children's commissioner, argue the measures don’t go far enough, and campaigners continue to push for tougher standards, including screen time limits.\n\nDespite concerns, the UK government insists that protecting children remains a top priority, and Ofcom is actively issuing guidance and consultations. Whether the act results in a significantly safer online environment will be evaluated in the coming years.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":41}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"},{"title":"What the UK's Online Safety Act means for IT companies","url":"https://www.itpro.com/business/policy-and-legislation/what-the-uks-online-safety-act-means-for-it-companies?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1752579339,"snippet":"The UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA), effective from 25 July 2025, mandates digital platforms—regardless of whether they are UK-based—to implement measures that protect users, especially children, from harmful and illegal content. Enforced by Ofcom, the act introduces strict compliance provisions, including risk assessments, design accountability for algorithms, and age assurance mechanisms. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to £18 million or 10% of global turnover. Ofcom released detailed codes of practice in April 2025, giving companies until July to align with new safety standards. While designed to enhance digital safety, the act raises concerns for smaller tech firms, citing high implementation costs, lack of clarity in defining “reasonable” measures, and potentially overbroad censorship. There are also apprehensions about undermining encryption and deterring market entry into the UK and EU. Despite these challenges, advocates argue the act is a crucial step toward safer digital environments. IT firms are urged to act quickly—conduct risk assessments, understand their obligations, and embed safety into their governance structures—to ensure timely compliance and avoid regulatory penalties.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":42}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"IT Pro"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn0search17turn0search9turn0search1","start_idx":6714,"end_idx":6760,"safe_urls":["https://www.aisi.gov.uk/about?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-institute-overview/introducing-the-ai-safety-institute?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ian-hogarths-declared-outside-interests/ian-hogarths-declared-outside-interests?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([AI Security Institute](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/about?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-institute-overview/introducing-the-ai-safety-institute?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"About | The AI Security Institute (AISI)","url":"https://www.aisi.gov.uk/about?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Our Chair Ian Hogarth brings experience as a tech investor and entrepreneur.
