This change is part of Microsoft’s compliance with the UK’s Online Safety Act, which mandates age verification to protect minors from harmful online content. Users will need to verify their age using ID, facial scans, or other methods through a third-party service like Yoti. While access to previously purchased games remains unaffected, many gamers have voiced privacy concerns and criticized the move as overreach.\n\nStarting July 25, 2025, UK regulations began enforcing stricter age checks for platforms offering adult content, impacting not just websites but also mainstream services like gaming and social media. Ofcom is leading enforcement, with potential fines of up to £18 million or 10% of global revenue for violators. Some users have turned to VPNs to bypass these new restrictions.

Ofcom, the UK media regulator, warned that non-compliant platforms could face penalties of up to 10% of global revenue or be blocked in the UK.\n\nSteam chose credit card verification as a relatively non-invasive method for age checking, as UK banks restrict credit cards to individuals over 18. Once a card is added, the Steam account is permanently verified. However, the policy has sparked backlash. Some adult users who rely on debit cards or avoid credit cards may now be excluded from browsing adult content. Additionally, privacy advocates criticize the policy for compelling users to share financial information to access content.\n\nWhile most mainstream games remain unaffected, niche adult titles may suffer reduced availability in the UK.

Ofcom has required the platforms to submit \"risk assessment\" reports due to their accessibility in the UK and potential violations tied to hosting hate speech, harassment, conspiracy theories, and bullying. Noncompliance could result in fines up to £18 million.\n\nLawyers Preston Byrne and Ron Coleman assert that the UK is overstepping by applying its laws to American-based websites. The lawsuit aims to block Ofcom from regulating their operations. The case highlights broader international friction over internet regulation, with concerns that the OSA may unfairly target far-right platforms.

The hearing targets the U.K.’s Online Safety Act (OSA) and the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), which are intended to regulate harmful online content but have sparked backlash from U.S. conservatives who argue these laws infringe on free speech. President Trump has threatened retaliatory tariffs and sanctions on foreign officials enforcing these laws.

The EU contends that the DSA is focused on creating a safer online environment by limiting illegal content such as hate speech and child exploitation, as well as disinformation and manipulative advertising tactics. However, the Trump administration has threatened sanctions against the EU and its member states over these regulations, asserting that they infringe on American free speech.\n\nIn response, Trump also vowed to impose tariffs on any countries enacting what he calls discriminatory digital rules against U.S. tech firms. Recent DSA enforcement has impacted companies like Meta, X (formerly Twitter), AliExpress, Temu, and TikTok. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned against UK and EU efforts to force censorship and weaken encryption, criticizing the UK's Investigatory Powers Act and the Online Safety Act. A significant point of contention was a UK directive that prompted Apple to remove end-to-end encryption from iCloud, though the request was later withdrawn.

These checks, introduced on July 25, 2025, require users in the UK to verify their age using methods such as facial scans, credit cards, or ID documents to access adult or potentially harmful online content. Though the Act was passed in 2023, the new verification requirements have intensified concerns about privacy, data security, censorship, and effectiveness.\n\nA petition calling for the repeal of the Act has garnered over 450,000 signatures, triggering a mandated parliamentary discussion. Critics argue that the new measures could lead to data leaks, abuse, misuse, and blocked access to valuable information. In response, many users are turning to virtual private networks (VPNs) to maintain privacy, with providers like Proton VPN reporting a massive usage spike after the checks went live.

Ofcom is investigating 4chan and has threatened it with fines for noncompliance, while also urging Kiwi Farms to meet the act’s requirements. The companies filed a lawsuit in a U.S. court, claiming the act undermines the First Amendment and allows UK law to infringe upon American rights, invoking historical references to U.S. independence. Critics, including prominent U.S. lawmakers and Donald Trump, have condemned European efforts to regulate American tech firms.

Despite the law mandating online platforms to shield children from harmful content including pornography and content promoting suicide and self-harm, de Souza argues the regulations remain too weak and fail to adequately address these issues. Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly took her life after viewing harmful content online, echoed these concerns, suggesting the rules allow loopholes and criticizing government priorities. The Molly Rose Foundation also expressed skepticism, warning that the rules may not effect substantial change due to leniencies in content recommendation guidelines. Ofcom defended its measures as ambitious and potentially transformative, emphasizing enforcement powers that include large fines and possible service bans. The NSPCC and the Center for Countering Digital Hate welcomed the regulations but urged stronger safeguards, particularly against encrypted messaging. While the act aims to significantly curb online harm to children, critics remain cautious, questioning whether the measures and enforcement will be sufficient. The rules are set to take effect in July 2025, with tech companies required to implement stringent age verification and content moderation protocols.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1745520300,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/online-safety-act-botched-2xk8xwlps","title":"Online Safety Act was botched from the start","snippet":"The article critiques the UK government's Online Safety Act (OSA), highlighting major flaws in its design and implementation. Originally intended to protect children from harmful content such as pornography and self-harm material, the legislation ended up creating complex, poorly defined regulations. A key issue emerged with Ofcom’s categorization of websites like Wikipedia as “Category 1” platforms, requiring identity-verifiable user filters that Wikipedia cannot implement. This unintended consequence threatened to limit access to such informational sites.\n\nThe confusion stems from OSA’s dual focus: child safety and regulating platforms with 'significant influence on public discourse.' Bureaucratic inefficiency and opaque decision-making further compounded the problem, as Ofcom lacked necessary data and legal authority to refine its approach until the law was enacted. Even when officials realized the problem, they were hesitant to amend regulations for fear of creating loopholes. The article argues that a more effective and less disruptive solution would involve controlling access through children’s devices rather than reshaping the internet itself. Overall, authorial tone suggests frustration with a misguided and overreaching regulatory attempt entangled in political and bureaucratic complexities.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1755109200,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ofcom.org.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/important-dates-for-online-safety-compliance","title":"Important dates for Online Safety compliance","snippet":"Oct 17, 2024 — This page explains the important milestones.

Enforced by Ofcom, the act introduces strict compliance provisions, including risk assessments, design accountability for algorithms, and age assurance mechanisms. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to £18 million or 10% of global turnover. Ofcom released detailed codes of practice in April 2025, giving companies until July to align with new safety standards. While designed to enhance digital safety, the act raises concerns for smaller tech firms, citing high implementation costs, lack of clarity in defining “reasonable” measures, and potentially overbroad censorship. There are also apprehensions about undermining encryption and deterring market entry into the UK and EU. Despite these challenges, advocates argue the act is a crucial step toward safer digital environments. IT firms are urged to act quickly—conduct risk assessments, understand their obligations, and embed safety into their governance structures—to ensure timely compliance and avoid regulatory penalties.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752579339,"attribution":"www.itpro.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/24/thursday-briefing-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-internet-safety-rules","title":"Thursday briefing: Everything you need to know about​ the new internet safety rules","snippet":"Starting July 25, UK social media platforms must comply with the Online Safety Act, a landmark 2023 regulation aimed at enhancing online protections for children. Implemented by Ofcom, the act mandates strict safeguards against harmful content like pornography and self-harm, with noncompliant companies subject to hefty fines and potential criminal charges. Platforms must now establish robust systems, rather than target individual content, to mitigate online harm.\n\nA particularly controversial provision requires age verification for access to pornography, raising privacy concerns but demanding adherence to UK GDPR standards. Social media may also need age checks to prevent under-18s from accessing harmful content.\n\nThe legislation was spurred by public advocacy following tragedies such as the death of Molly Russell, and gains support from figures like Baroness Kidron and Rio Ferdinand. However, some critics, including the children's commissioner, argue the measures don’t go far enough, and campaigners continue to push for tougher standards, including screen time limits.\n\nDespite concerns, the UK government insists that protecting children remains a top priority, and Ofcom is actively issuing guidance and consultations. Whether the act results in a significantly safer online environment will be evaluated in the coming years.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753335266,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/91414488-7146-4b9c-9ac4-15767be4ec9f","title":"UK to crack down on illegal content across social media","snippet":"Starting next week, the UK media regulator Ofcom will begin enforcing new stringent rules aimed at reducing illegal and harmful content on social media platforms, search engines, and messaging apps under the Online Safety Act (OSA). The OSA mandates tech companies to carry out risk assessments and implement rigorous content moderation strategies to mitigate exposure to 17 types of illegal content, including terrorism, child sexual abuse, suicide encouragement, and fraud. Platforms must designate a senior executive to ensure compliance, improve reporting procedures, enhance moderation, and upgrade algorithmic safety measures. Non-compliance may result in enforcement actions, including fines of up to £18 million or 10% of a company's global revenue. Ofcom will first target major platforms with high user volumes in the UK or those posing significant risks. Legal experts caution that beyond financial penalties, regulatory interventions could deeply impact companies' operations. The law firm Linklaters described this compliance deadline as a critical milestone, warning that some companies might not have adhered sufficiently to the requirements, risking serious regulatory consequences.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1742130054.218,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b79e5ba0bc800bb22261c498af8124","search_turns_count":1,"search_source":"composer_auto","client_reported_search_source":"composer_auto","request_id":"9791953aaccbf52d-LHR","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"9968298d-8327-4e2a-ad7d-ce104e8b6ffe","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9968298d-8327-4e2a-ad7d-ce104e8b6ffe","children":["a3fc0ed5-2ffd-4ee8-ab4b-02579213407c"]},"a3fc0ed5-2ffd-4ee8-ab4b-02579213407c":{"id":"a3fc0ed5-2ffd-4ee8-ab4b-02579213407c","message":{"id":"a3fc0ed5-2ffd-4ee8-ab4b-02579213407c","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{"sonicberry_model_id":"current_sonicberry_paid","real_author":"tool:web","source":"sonic_tool"}},"create_time":1756864092.48902,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here’s a concise and chronological timeline of the key milestones in the creation and rollout of the UK’s **Online Safety Act (OSA)**—from early proposals to its enforcement and recent developments:\n\n---\n\n###  **1.

Key milestones include codes of practice, enforcement kicks starting Spring 2025, and full child protection duties from July 2025. Recent months have seen robust enforcement, public controversy over privacy, and legal challenges—most notably from Wikipedia entities and U.S.-based platforms.\n\nLet me know if you'd like the

Enforced by Ofcom, the act introduces strict compliance provisions, including risk assessments, design accountability for algorithms, and age assurance mechanisms. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to £18 million or 10% of global turnover. Ofcom released detailed codes of practice in April 2025, giving companies until July to align with new safety standards. While designed to enhance digital safety, the act raises concerns for smaller tech firms, citing high implementation costs, lack of clarity in defining “reasonable” measures, and potentially overbroad censorship. There are also apprehensions about undermining encryption and deterring market entry into the UK and EU. Despite these challenges, advocates argue the act is a crucial step toward safer digital environments. IT firms are urged to act quickly—conduct risk assessments, understand their obligations, and embed safety into their governance structures—to ensure timely compliance and avoid regulatory penalties.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2"},{"matched_text":"**Early 2025**: Ofcom launches an **enforcement program** for record-keeping and illegal content risk assessment duties.

Implemented by Ofcom, the act mandates strict safeguards against harmful content like pornography and self-harm, with noncompliant companies subject to hefty fines and potential criminal charges. Platforms must now establish robust systems, rather than target individual content, to mitigate online harm.\n\nA particularly controversial provision requires age verification for access to pornography, raising privacy concerns but demanding adherence to UK GDPR standards. Social media may also need age checks to prevent under-18s from accessing harmful content.\n\nThe legislation was spurred by public advocacy following tragedies such as the death of Molly Russell, and gains support from figures like Baroness Kidron and Rio Ferdinand. However, some critics, including the children's commissioner, argue the measures don’t go far enough, and campaigners continue to push for tougher standards, including screen time limits.\n\nDespite concerns, the UK government insists that protecting children remains a top priority, and Ofcom is actively issuing guidance and consultations. Whether the act results in a significantly safer online environment will be evaluated in the coming years.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":27}],"hue":null,"attributions":null},{"title":"What the UK's Online Safety Act means for IT companies","url":"https://www.itpro.com/business/policy-and-legislation/what-the-uks-online-safety-act-means-for-it-companies?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1752579339,"snippet":"The UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA), effective from 25 July 2025, mandates digital platforms—regardless of whether they are UK-based—to implement measures that protect users, especially children, from harmful and illegal content. Enforced by Ofcom, the act introduces strict compliance provisions, including risk assessments, design accountability for algorithms, and age assurance mechanisms. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to £18 million or 10% of global turnover. Ofcom released detailed codes of practice in April 2025, giving companies until July to align with new safety standards. While designed to enhance digital safety, the act raises concerns for smaller tech firms, citing high implementation costs, lack of clarity in defining “reasonable” measures, and potentially overbroad censorship. There are also apprehensions about undermining encryption and deterring market entry into the UK and EU. Despite these challenges, advocates argue the act is a crucial step toward safer digital environments. IT firms are urged to act quickly—conduct risk assessments, understand their obligations, and embed safety into their governance structures—to ensure timely compliance and avoid regulatory penalties.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":26}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2"},{"matched_text":"**Public/Industry Reactions**:","start_idx":2494,"end_idx":2524,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"**Public/Industry Reactions**:","prompt_text":null,"type":"attribution","attributable_index":"2439-0","attributions":null,"attributions_debug":null},{"matched_text":"**Wikipedia and Wikimedia** launch legal challenges, arguing OSA would force identity checks and threaten editorial independence.

They argue that the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA), enforced by Ofcom, infringes on their U.S. Constitutional rights. Ofcom has required the platforms to submit \"risk assessment\" reports due to their accessibility in the UK and potential violations tied to hosting hate speech, harassment, conspiracy theories, and bullying. Noncompliance could result in fines up to £18 million.\n\nLawyers Preston Byrne and Ron Coleman assert that the UK is overstepping by applying its laws to American-based websites. The lawsuit aims to block Ofcom from regulating their operations. The case highlights broader international friction over internet regulation, with concerns that the OSA may unfairly target far-right platforms.

Ofcom is investigating 4chan and has threatened it with fines for noncompliance, while also urging Kiwi Farms to meet the act’s requirements. The companies filed a lawsuit in a U.S. court, claiming the act undermines the First Amendment and allows UK law to infringe upon American rights, invoking historical references to U.S. independence. Critics, including prominent U.S. lawmakers and Donald Trump, have condemned European efforts to regulate American tech firms.

President Trump has threatened retaliatory tariffs and sanctions on foreign officials enforcing these laws.

Ofcom, the UK media regulator, warned that non-compliant platforms could face penalties of up to 10% of global revenue or be blocked in the UK.\n\nSteam chose credit card verification as a relatively non-invasive method for age checking, as UK banks restrict credit cards to individuals over 18. Once a card is added, the Steam account is permanently verified. However, the policy has sparked backlash. Some adult users who rely on debit cards or avoid credit cards may now be excluded from browsing adult content. Additionally, privacy advocates criticize the policy for compelling users to share financial information to access content.\n\nWhile most mainstream games remain unaffected, niche adult titles may suffer reduced availability in the UK.

Ofcom is leading enforcement, with potential fines of up to £18 million or 10% of global revenue for violators. Some users have turned to VPNs to bypass these new restrictions.

Despite the law mandating online platforms to shield children from harmful content including pornography and content promoting suicide and self-harm, de Souza argues the regulations remain too weak and fail to adequately address these issues. Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly took her life after viewing harmful content online, echoed these concerns, suggesting the rules allow loopholes and criticizing government priorities. The Molly Rose Foundation also expressed skepticism, warning that the rules may not effect substantial change due to leniencies in content recommendation guidelines. Ofcom defended its measures as ambitious and potentially transformative, emphasizing enforcement powers that include large fines and possible service bans. The NSPCC and the Center for Countering Digital Hate welcomed the regulations but urged stronger safeguards, particularly against encrypted messaging. While the act aims to significantly curb online harm to children, critics remain cautious, questioning whether the measures and enforcement will be sufficient. The rules are set to take effect in July 2025, with tech companies required to implement stringent age verification and content moderation protocols.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":28}],"hue":null,"attributions":null},{"title":"Thursday briefing: Everything you need to know about​ the new internet safety rules","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/24/thursday-briefing-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-internet-safety-rules?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1753335266,"snippet":"Starting July 25, UK social media platforms must comply with the Online Safety Act, a landmark 2023 regulation aimed at enhancing online protections for children. Implemented by Ofcom, the act mandates strict safeguards against harmful content like pornography and self-harm, with noncompliant companies subject to hefty fines and potential criminal charges. Platforms must now establish robust systems, rather than target individual content, to mitigate online harm.\n\nA particularly controversial provision requires age verification for access to pornography, raising privacy concerns but demanding adherence to UK GDPR standards. Social media may also need age checks to prevent under-18s from accessing harmful content.\n\nThe legislation was spurred by public advocacy following tragedies such as the death of Molly Russell, and gains support from figures like Baroness Kidron and Rio Ferdinand. However, some critics, including the children's commissioner, argue the measures don’t go far enough, and campaigners continue to push for tougher standards, including screen time limits.\n\nDespite concerns, the UK government insists that protecting children remains a top priority, and Ofcom is actively issuing guidance and consultations.

These checks, introduced on July 25, 2025, require users in the UK to verify their age using methods such as facial scans, credit cards, or ID documents to access adult or potentially harmful online content. Though the Act was passed in 2023, the new verification requirements have intensified concerns about privacy, data security, censorship, and effectiveness.\n\nA petition calling for the repeal of the Act has garnered over 450,000 signatures, triggering a mandated parliamentary discussion. Critics argue that the new measures could lead to data leaks, abuse, misuse, and blocked access to valuable information. In response, many users are turning to virtual private networks (VPNs) to maintain privacy, with providers like Proton VPN reporting a massive usage spike after the checks went live. Despite mounting criticism, the government continues to work with Ofcom to implement the act in full, asserting it's necessary to protect online users, particularly

Defence Secretary John Healey denied these claims, stating the decommissioned equipment was obsolete or economically unrepairable. Additionally, Labour's Diane Abbott and Conservative Sir Edward Leigh jointly urged MPs to reject the assisted dying bill due to insufficient scrutiny and risks to vulnerable people.\n\nAngela Rayner stood in for PM Keir Starmer at PMQs, facing Alex Burghart, who criticized Labour's economic policies and inheritance tax changes affecting farmers. Rayner defended the changes, emphasizing support and investment in farming, while accusing Conservatives of scaremongering. Elsewhere, senior MPs criticized unhelpful commentary and misinformation following the Southport attacks, stressing the importance of fair reporting during criminal investigations.\n\nIn other developments, Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will complete his duties by January 6 after resigning over insufficient action on abuse cases, and the Conservative party finalized its shadow frontbench, now half comprising its MPs. The government also plans to reform the 'Right to Buy' scheme, proposing significant changes to make it fairer and sustainable.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1732123854,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.onlinesafetyact.net","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.onlinesafetyact.net/analysis/manifesto-watch-the-headlines/","title":"Manifesto watch: the headlines","snippet":"Jun 13, 2024 — With the UK General Election just three weeks away, the three main parties have now published their manifestos and we've produced a ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.onlinesafetyact.net"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"x.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://x.com/peterkyle/status/1950092871614230571","title":"Peter Kyle on X: \"If you want to overturn the Online Safety ...","snippet":"If you want to overturn the Online Safety Act you are on the side of predators.

Kyle criticized Farage for calling for the withdrawal of the Act, which imposes age verification requirements on websites with potentially harmful content, such as pornography and suicide-related material. The minister argued that opponents of the law are aligning themselves with online predators and labeled Farage's stance as a threat to child safety.\n\nFarage condemned Kyle’s remarks as “disgusting” and demanded an apology, saying the Act suppresses free speech and alters the content users see on social media. Reform UK, currently gaining in the polls, views the law as granting excessive government control over online speech. Critics, including privacy advocates and tech firms, fear the law could be used to censor lawful content critical of the government. The legislation, originally proposed in 2019, aims to better protect minors online, but remains controversial for its impact on digital freedom. Kyle reaffirmed his position, stressing that online dangers must be controlled to make the internet safer for children.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753784454.387,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-andrew-tate-nigel-farage-7rjxb8ggd","title":"Labour attack ad highlights Nigel Farage's praise for Andrew Tate","snippet":"In a new campaign advert, the UK Labour Party targets Reform UK leader Nigel Farage over his past praise of controversial influencer Andrew Tate, linking Farage’s support to concerns about online radicalisation and misogyny. The advert highlights Farage’s 2024 comments praising Tate’s defense of \"male culture,\" while Tate faces multiple charges, including rape and human trafficking, which he denies. Labour criticizes Farage's plan to repeal the Online Safety Act—legislation aimed at protecting children from harmful online content—as making boys vulnerable to figures like Tate.\n\nThe ad, set to run on social media, is part of a broader strategy from Labour to challenge Farage and Reform UK, particularly in areas concerning women's and children's safety. Labour's Peter Kyle previously accused Farage of siding with abusers, prompting Farage to demand an apology. Meanwhile, a Labour source confirmed continued focus on Farage’s online safety stance, underscoring the party’s aim to combat toxic online masculinity. Reform counters by accusing the Labour government of failing to protect women due to broader criminal justice issues.

While the measures aim to protect minors, they have led to a substantial drop in web traffic for sites complying with the law, especially adult websites. In contrast, non-compliant sites have seen a surge in traffic—some even tripling their UK visitor numbers. An analysis of the 90 most visited porn sites revealed that the few which avoided implementing age verification enjoyed increased traffic and likely revenue.\n\nOfcom, the UK's communications regulator, is currently investigating several companies that operate 34 such sites to assess the effectiveness of their age checks. Meanwhile, compliant sites bear the dual burden of reduced traffic and the cost of third-party verification services.\n\nThe legislation has stirred public criticism, with over 500,000 signatures on a petition advocating its repeal—though the UK government maintains no plans to reverse the law. Internationally, similar laws are taking shape, such as in Mississippi, USA, where smaller platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon are choosing to block users from the state rather than implement complex age verification systems. Australia is also exploring nationwide implementation. The global trend suggests the internet may become more fragmented in response to rising regulatory demands.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756728822,"attribution":"www.pcgamer.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/nearly-two-thirds-of-brits-surveyed-about-the-uks-new-age-verification-laws-think-the-changes-arent-effective-but-even-more-support-them-being-made-in-the-first-place/","title":"Nearly two-thirds of Brits surveyed about the UK's new age verification laws think the changes aren't effective, but even more support them being made in the first place","snippet":"A YouGov survey of nearly 4,400 British adults reveals that while almost 70% support the UK's new Online Safety Act—which mandates stringent age verification for accessing adult content—64% doubt its effectiveness in actually preventing under-18s from bypassing restrictions. The law, implemented a week prior, was designed to replace simplistic self-declarations like “I am over 18” with more robust verification measures. However, many users have found ways to circumvent the system, including using screenshots or gaming tools, triggering concerns about the practical enforcement of the law.\n\nThere is also significant public discomfort with privacy and data security, since verification is handled by various private companies without centralized oversight. Reports have highlighted vulnerabilities and even false blocks triggered by content filters. Meanwhile, the Online Safety Act has led to a surge in VPN usage to evade detection, although the UK government has stated it won’t ban VPNs but will closely monitor their misuse. Despite widespread support for the law’s intent, many believe it’s largely symbolic and ineffective, with little likelihood the government will revise or centralize the system due to cost considerations.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754062227,"attribution":"www.pcgamer.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"yougov.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://yougov.co.uk/technology/articles/52693-how-have-britons-reacted-to-age-verification","title":"How have Britons reacted to age verification?","snippet":"26% of Britons say they have encountered the new age restrictions introduced by the Online Safety Act in the near-week since they came into ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753976128.563878,"attribution":"yougov.co.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/society/survey-results/daily/2025/07/24/8b234/2","title":"And do you support or oppose requiring age verification to ...","snippet":"Jul 24, 2025 — A new government policy comes into force that will require all pornographic websites to perform identity checks in order to verify that visitors are aged 18 or ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"yougov.co.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/society/survey-results/daily/2025/07/24/8b234/3","title":"And how effective do you think this system will be at ...","snippet":"Jul 24, 2025 — And how effective do you think this system will be at preventing those younger than 18 from gaining access to pornography?","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"yougov.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reddit.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1me72rg/yougov_69_of_britons_say_they_support_the_new_age/","title":"[YouGov] 69% of Britons say they support the new age ...","snippet":"[YouGov] 69% of Britons say they support the new age verification rules brought in by the Online Safety Act.This is despite just 24 ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753981247.405,"attribution":"www.reddit.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"theweekinpolls.substack.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://theweekinpolls.substack.com/p/what-do-the-polls-say-about-the-online","title":"What do the polls say about the Online Safety Act?","snippet":"YouGov also asked whether people support “requiring age verification to access pornography sites”.

Right-wing critics label it censorship, while left-leaning commentators worry it harms children's safety and online access, reflecting broader distrust across the political spectrum. Billinge explains that the act aims to make tech companies proactively assess and mitigate harmful content—like child abuse material or suicide promotion—via principled, flexible guidelines rather than mandated technologies, reducing overreach concerns.\n\nCritics blame the act for poor platform decisions and censorship, but Billinge argues these practices predate the legislation and are influenced by opaque corporate agendas. Misunderstandings around age verification, like Spotify's approach, and issues with circumvention via VPNs are acknowledged, but seen as teething issues rather than reasons for repeal.\n\nThe article emphasizes that the legislation marks a shift toward greater transparency and responsibility in tech governance. While addressing systemic issues like \"surveillance capitalism\" requires broader reforms, the Online Safety Act is a positive step in regulating platforms’ influence and improving online safety—particularly for children. Billinge urges thoughtful engagement with regulation, not cynical dismissal.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754061747,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"reason.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://reason.com/2025/08/06/10-examples-of-absurd-fallout-from-the-u-k-s-online-safety-act/","title":"10 examples of absurd fallout from the U.K.'s Online Safety ...","snippet":"Aug 6, 2025 — The portion of the law that took effect on July 25 requires websites with content that authorities have deemed \"harmful to children\" to verify ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754498144,"attribution":"reason.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.nspcc.org.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.nspcc.org.uk/about-us/news-opinion/2023/uk-public-backs-strengthening-online-safety-bill-to-give-children-a-voice-in-online-safety-regulation/","title":"UK public backs strengthening Online Safety Bill to give ...","snippet":"May 10, 2023 — An amendment that would create a dedicated child online safety advocate is due to be debated by Lords next week.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"www.nspcc.org.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.instagram.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNlXiO0MDlf/","title":"A majority of Britons believe children under 18 should be ...","snippet":"Uk's Online Safety Act has yet another major flaw.

While the law mandates age-verification checks and threatens hefty fines for non-compliant platforms, critics argue its vague definitions of \"harm\" have led to excessive censorship. Legitimate discussions, such as an MP’s speech on grooming gangs, have been restricted, and even innocuous communities, like cider chatrooms, have gone silent.\n\nSupporters acknowledge the urgent need for regulation, citing alarming statistics: half of 13-year-olds have encountered pornography online, and a quarter of child suicides are linked to harmful internet content.

However, game ownership and access will remain unaffected.

Critics also question the effectiveness of these measures, suggesting that tech-savvy minors could bypass age checks using VPNs.

However, this autonomy is under threat due to new age-verification laws being enacted in the US and UK, which require users to upload IDs to access adult content. Advocates argue these laws protect minors, while critics contend they undermine privacy, restrict free speech, and could drive both creators and consumers to unsafe, unregulated spaces online.\n\nThe laws are part of broader conservative initiatives, such as Project 2025, which seeks to diminish access to porn entirely. As a result, performers are facing significant drops in income, rising censorship, and legal threats that disproportionately harm marginalized communities and independent creators. The shift away from a decentralized, diverse porn landscape could lead to corporate monopolies dominating content, risking ethical transparency and representation. Many in the industry call for a deeper dialogue on sex education and sexuality, emphasizing that comprehensive sexual understanding—not restrictive regulation—is the best path forward.

While the measures aim to protect minors, they have led to a substantial drop in web traffic for sites complying with the law, especially adult websites. In contrast, non-compliant sites have seen a surge in traffic—some even tripling their UK visitor numbers. An analysis of the 90 most visited porn sites revealed that the few which avoided implementing age verification enjoyed increased traffic and likely revenue.\n\nOfcom, the UK's communications regulator, is currently investigating several companies that operate 34 such sites to assess the effectiveness of their age checks. Meanwhile, compliant sites bear the dual burden of reduced traffic and the cost of third-party verification services.\n\nThe legislation has stirred public criticism, with over 500,000 signatures on a petition advocating its repeal—though the UK government maintains no plans to reverse the law. Internationally, similar laws are taking shape, such as in Mississippi, USA, where smaller platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon are choosing to block users from the state rather than implement complex age verification systems. Australia is also exploring nationwide implementation.

So delivering fast after July 2024 wasn’t a U-turn; it was the plan. citeturn1view3\n\n- #2 Public opinion makes the “soft on child safety” risk deadly  \n  In late July 2025, **69% of Britons** told YouGov they supported the new age-verification rules (even though most doubted they would work well). Moving to dilute or delay would have invited “you’re siding with predators” attack lines—exactly the line Peter Kyle used against Reform when repeal was floated. citeturn4view0turn0news40\n\n- #3 The machinery was already rolling  \n  The Act got Royal Assent in Oct 2023. By the time Labour took office (Jul 2024), Ofcom had a phased **implementation roadmap** and just needed ministers to do specific bits (lay codes, sign off categorisation thresholds, and make secondary regs). Labour ministers did exactly that on **16 Dec 2024**, explicitly prioritising **swift implementation**. Repeal/major rewrite would have needed precious primary-legislation time. citeturn5view0turn0search0turn2view0\n\n- #4 Shaping without reopening: use priorities + secondary rules  \n  Rather than re-legislate, Labour issued a **Statement of Strategic Priorities** (May 2025)—“safety by design”, transparency, VAWG focus, etc.—steering Ofcom’s approach while keeping momentum. That’s a classic way to put a Labour imprint on a Conservative-era law. citeturn0search2turn0search16\n\n- #5 Political wedge value  \n  The party has leaned into online-harms messaging (misogyny/Tate, protection of boys and girls), and has used the OSA to box in opponents on child protection. Picking a fight to weaken or pause it would have opened an unnecessary flank. citeturn0news41\n\n- #6 Practical endpoint already in sight  \n  With Ofcom’s three-phase plan underway and full implementation slated around **2026**, the fastest way to “fix the internet” (as they frame it) is to **deliver and tweak** rather than delay and rewrite—especially when NGOs would attack any back-sliding. citeturn5view0\n\nIf you want, I can map the **specific levers** Labour actually pulled (codes they laid, thresholds they set, guidance they green-lit) versus the parts they could still modify without reopening the Act.\n\nnavlistRecent coverage & flashpointsturn0news40,turn6news20,turn6news21"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"citeturn1view3","start_idx":537,"end_idx":554,"safe_urls":["https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Change-Labour-Party-Manifesto-2024-large-print.pdf"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Labour Party](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Change-Labour-Party-Manifesto-2024-large-print.pdf))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"","url":"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Change-Labour-Party-Manifesto-2024-large-print.pdf","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":3}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Labour Party"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn4view0turn0news40","start_idx":932,"end_idx":961,"safe_urls":["https://www.ft.com/content/0359d361-b4ab-4ec9-ae3e-025e98037c0b?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://yougov.co.uk/technology/articles/52693-how-have-britons-reacted-to-age-verification"],"refs":[],"alt":"([YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/technology/articles/52693-how-have-britons-reacted-to-age-verification), [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/0359d361-b4ab-4ec9-ae3e-025e98037c0b?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"How have Britons reacted to age verification? | YouGov","url":"https://yougov.co.uk/technology/articles/52693-how-have-britons-reacted-to-age-verification","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":4,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"YouGov"},{"title":"Minister accuses Nigel Farage of siding with late paedophile Jimmy Savile in online safety row","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/0359d361-b4ab-4ec9-ae3e-025e98037c0b?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1753784454.387,"snippet":"A heated political row has erupted in the UK after Technology Secretary Peter Kyle accused Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of siding with notorious paedophile Jimmy Savile in a dispute over the newly enacted Online Safety Act. Kyle criticized Farage for calling for the withdrawal of the Act, which imposes age verification requirements on websites with potentially harmful content, such as pornography and suicide-related material. The minister argued that opponents of the law are aligning themselves with online predators and labeled Farage's stance as a threat to child safety.\n\nFarage condemned Kyle’s remarks as “disgusting” and demanded an apology, saying the Act suppresses free speech and alters the content users see on social media. Reform UK, currently gaining in the polls, views the law as granting excessive government control over online speech. Critics, including privacy advocates and tech firms, fear the law could be used to censor lawful content critical of the government. The legislation, originally proposed in 2019, aims to better protect minors online, but remains controversial for its impact on digital freedom. Kyle reaffirmed his position, stressing that online dangers must be controlled to make the internet safer for children.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":40}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Financial Times"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn5view0turn0search0turn2view0","start_idx":1431,"end_idx":1472,"safe_urls":["https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/","https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-12-16/hlws308","https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([House of Commons Library](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/), [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [UK Parliament](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-12-16/hlws308))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Implementation of the Online Safety Act - House of Commons Library","url":"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/","pub_date":null,"snippet":null,"attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":5,"ref_type":"view","ref_index":0}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"House of Commons Library"},{"title":"Online Safety Act: explainer","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1715154823,"snippet":"Ofcom published an updated roadmap setting out its implementation plans on 17 October 2024.

Labour criticizes Farage's plan to repeal the Online Safety Act—legislation aimed at protecting children from harmful online content—as making boys vulnerable to figures like Tate.\n\nThe ad, set to run on social media, is part of a broader strategy from Labour to challenge Farage and Reform UK, particularly in areas concerning women's and children's safety. Labour's Peter Kyle previously accused Farage of siding with abusers, prompting Farage to demand an apology. Meanwhile, a Labour source confirmed continued focus on Farage’s online safety stance, underscoring the party’s aim to combat toxic online masculinity.

These proposals indicate a focus on immediate AI misuse rather than existential risks, contrasting with the Conservative Party's approach.

Other propositions include AI-driven election campaign guidelines, though skepticism exists about their feasibility.

Trade unions and MPs have raised alarm over cancelled raw material orders and thousands of threatened jobs. While Labour has not committed to nationalisation, discussions are ongoing.\n\nStarmer also addressed the digital services tax and Online Safety Act in trade talks with the U.S., reiterating his stance on maintaining child protection while ensuring fair tech taxation. He stressed the importance of international security amidst rising state-based threats from countries like China and Russia.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves rejected calls for a \"Buy British\" campaign in response to U.S. tariffs, citing concerns over protectionism. Meanwhile, global markets rebounded slightly amid ongoing tariff uncertainty.\n\nAdditionally, the UK government announced plans to establish a new child protection authority, following criticisms over delayed implementation of the IICSA recommendations. The report stage debate on an assisted dying bill was postponed to allow more time for review. The government also highlighted progress on GP recruitment and vowed further primary care reforms.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1744132914,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.thetimes.co.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-vows-to-toughen-child-online-safety-law-after-ofcom-criticised-nw9jqr29c","title":"Labour vows to toughen child online safety law after Ofcom criticised","snippet":"Labour ministers have pledged to strengthen online safety laws after criticisms were raised against Ofcom for not adequately enforcing the Online Safety Act. The act aims to make social media and search platforms safer, but 23 organizations, including the NSPCC and the Molly Rose Foundation, believe Ofcom is not fully implementing it. Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary, emphasized the government's commitment to a safer online environment and acknowledged the need for further action. Bereaved parents, like Ian Russell, whose daughter took her life after exposure to harmful content online, are pushing for stronger legislation. The charities argue that current draft rules do not sufficiently protect children and call for more stringent measures on live streaming, notifications, infinite scrolling, and age verification. Ofcom maintains that it will address these risks in forthcoming guidelines and has enforcement powers to hold platforms accountable.

Reform leader Nigel Farage criticized the law, voicing concerns about free speech and the potential for children to be driven toward more dangerous corners of the internet such as the dark web, especially through VPN use. In response, Technology Secretary Peter Kyle accused Farage of aligning with online predators, even comparing his stance to supporting figures like Jimmy Savile, prompting outrage from Farage and Reform’s former chairman Zia Yusuf, who called the remarks \"disgusting\".\n\nKyle defended the law as vital for child protection, asserting that opposing it equates to supporting predators. Critics like Farage argue it overreaches and risks censorship. The act mandates platforms to use age-verification tools like facial recognition and official ID checks to restrict access to harmful content, including pornography and material related to suicide and self-harm. Analysts caution about a surge in VPN usage among youth seeking to bypass restrictions, raising cybersecurity concerns. Some opposition efforts, including proposals to combat VPN workarounds, failed to pass. Despite criticism, Labour supports the legislation as essential child protection rather than censorship.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753776900,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/farage-wants-to-enable-modern-day-jimmy-saviles-says-jess-phillips-t8fj3xbzs","title":"Farage would enable 'modern-day Jimmy Saviles', says Jess Phillips","snippet":"In a sharply critical article, Jess Phillips, UK Home Office minister for safeguarding, accuses Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of endangering children's safety by pledging to repeal the Online Safety Act. She argues that doing so would empower \"modern-day Jimmy Saviles\"—a reference to notorious child abuser Jimmy Savile—and enable online predators like convicted sex offender Alexander McCartney. Phillips contends that Farage prioritizes social media attention over child protection, ignoring the real dangers children face online. She cites harrowing cases, including the suicide of 12-year-old Cimarron Thomas, to underscore the urgency of tougher digital safety laws.\n\nFarage and the Reform Party claim the Online Safety Act threatens free speech. However, Phillips, alongside fellow minister Peter Kyle, dismisses this, stressing that growing online sexual abuse—often on mainstream sites—demands stronger regulation. She warns of the worrying rise in child-on-child abuse, attributing it in part to exposure to violent online content. Critics from Reform UK dismissed Phillips’s comments as politically motivated and hypocritical, pointing to the government’s own past inaction on grooming gangs. Phillips insists, however, that safeguarding children must take precedence over political point-scoring or ideological concerns about free speech.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754250621,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.ft.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/2e8d7ad0-f162-49ce-b664-eecd054ce862","title":"Transcript: Trump turbulence - How should Labour play it?","snippet":"In the Financial Times' Political Fix podcast episode, host Lucy Fisher, along with Jim Pickard, Anna Gross, and Edward Luce, discuss the implications of Donald Trump's return to the Oval Office for the UK and Labour party.

Huge platforms such as Facebook and Google … lack of regulation has let harms and abuses proliferate.” citeturn0search5\n\nPowell emphasized that:\n\n- Big tech has outgrown its startup roots to now “influence almost every aspect of our lives”—from socializing to news consumption—and regulation has lagged behind.\n- The Bill creates a framework of **strong, independent regulation**, which Labour endorsed as a necessary corrective.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Labour’s Cooperative, Yet Watchful, Position**\n\nAnother Bloc in **Hansard, Commons debate (12 Sept 2023)** made the posture clear:\n\n> “Labour has always supported an online safety regime, and has sought to work with the Government while raising valid concerns carefully throughout. … We all want to keep people safe … Labour is proud of the changes it has developed and pushed on … we will continue to push the Government to deliver this regime in good time.” citeturn0search1\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- Labour didn’t merely support the Bill—they actively collaborated, driving improvements while signalling their intention to maintain oversight and accountability in delivery.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Manifesto Pledges: Accelerate and Build Upon the Act**\n\nWhen reviewing the **2024 Labour manifesto**, while it didn’t explain motivations in deep detail, it clearly committed to advancing the Act:\n\n- Labour pledged to **“build on the Online Safety Act”**, bringing provisions “as quickly as possible,” and exploring further safeguards for digital safety. citeturn0search6turn0search2\n\nAlthough not granular, this reflects a strategic decision:\n\n- Labour viewed the OSA not as a Conservative “payload,” but as a functional baseline to *improve upon*—a present regulatory structure they could ethically and politically lean into, rather than dismantle.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Public and Campaigner Pressure Reinforcing Political Will**\n\nThough not directly cited in their manifesto, significant advocacy shaped the environment:\n\n- The **Times reported (July 2024)** that Labour ministers, led by Science Secretary Peter Kyle, engaged with bereaved families—including the Molly Rose Foundation—to signal commitment to “building on the Online Safety Act” and intensify protections for children. citeturn0news20\n\nThis personalized context:\n\n- Reinforced that Labour’s support was informed by public safety concerns and campaigners’ urging—not mere political opportunism.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Summary: Labour's Rationale at a Glance**\n\n| Driver                                       | Evidence / Insight                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Recognition of harm proliferation**        | Labour MPs cited the unregulated rise of online harms by big tech platforms. citeturn0search5turn0search3 |\n| **Support for independent, statutory regulation** | Labour endorsed the duty-of-care and oversight framework embedded in the Bill. citeturn0search5turn0search1 |\n| **Collaborative oversight**                  | Labour pledged to work with government but keep scrutiny and improvement active. citeturn0search1 |\n| **Practical, streamlined implementation**     | Manifesto commitment to “build on it…as quickly as possible” suggests expedience and pragmatism. citeturn0search6turn0search2 |\n| **Real-world pressure from campaigners/families** | Engagements like with Molly Rose Foundation added urgency and moral weight. citeturn0news20 |\n\n---\n\n###  In Short\n\nLabour’s support for accelerating the Online Safety Act wasn't coincidental or careless.

The act aims to make social media and search platforms safer, but 23 organizations, including the NSPCC and the Molly Rose Foundation, believe Ofcom is not fully implementing it. Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary, emphasized the government's commitment to a safer online environment and acknowledged the need for further action. Bereaved parents, like Ian Russell, whose daughter took her life after exposure to harmful content online, are pushing for stronger legislation. The charities argue that current draft rules do not sufficiently protect children and call for more stringent measures on live streaming, notifications, infinite scrolling, and age verification. Ofcom maintains that it will address these risks in forthcoming guidelines and has enforcement powers to hold platforms accountable. The consultation on the draft codes ends on Wednesday, with the aim of finalizing the 'first edition' codes within a year.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":20}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2"},{"matched_text":"This personalized context:","start_idx":2702,"end_idx":2728,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"This personalized context:","prompt_text":null,"type":"attribution","attributable_index":"2700-0","attributions":null,"attributions_debug":null},{"matched_text":"Reinforced that Labour’s support was informed by public safety concerns and campaigners’ urging—not mere political opportunism.","start_idx":2732,"end_idx":2859,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"Reinforced that Labour’s support was informed by public safety concerns and campaigners’ urging—not mere political opportunism.","prompt_text":null,"type":"attribution","attributable_index":"2700-1","attributions":null,"attributions_debug":null},{"matched_text":"**Recognition of harm proliferation**","start_idx":3187,"end_idx":3224,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"**Recognition of harm proliferation**","prompt_text":null,"type":"attribution","attributable_index":"2700-2","attributions":null,"attributions_debug":null},{"matched_text":"Labour MPs cited the unregulated rise of online harms by big tech platforms.","start_idx":3234,"end_idx":3310,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"Labour MPs cited the unregulated rise of online harms by big tech platforms.","prompt_text":null,"type":"attribution","attributable_index":"2700-3","attributions":null,"attributions_debug":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn0search5turn0search3","start_idx":3311,"end_idx":3343,"safe_urls":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kyle?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-01-17/debates/9E767367-16E1-4A11-9766-6A4EDFEC4F1C/OnlineSafetyBill?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://parallelparliament.co.uk/mp/lucy-powell/bill/2021-22/onlinesafety?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://techinsights.linklaters.com/post/102jbno/scrolling-through-the-uk-political-parties-online-safety-promises?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ft.com/content/2e8d7ad0-f162-49ce-b664-eecd054ce862?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/bills/2021-22/onlinesafety/debates?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1m98dtk/petition_repeal_the_online_safety_act_has_reached/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/04/monday-briefing-why-opponents-of-the-online-safety-act-arent-on-jimmy-saviles-side?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/farage-wants-to-enable-modern-day-jimmy-saviles-says-jess-phillips-t8fj3xbzs?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-vows-to-toughen-child-online-safety-law-after-ofcom-criticised-nw9jqr29c?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/online-safety-act-dark-web-nigel-farage-2lnfgvbds?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2025-02-24a.1524.0&s=wikipedia&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1m98dtk/petition_repeal_the_online_safety_act_has_reached/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Parallel Parliament](https://parallelparliament.co.uk/mp/lucy-powell/bill/2021-22/onlinesafety?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Petition \"Repeal the Online Safety Act\" has reached ...","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1m98dtk/petition_repeal_the_online_safety_act_has_reached/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1753471471.109,"snippet":"Labour thought the bill didn't go far enough.

Microsoft has announced that failure to verify age—through methods including ID upload, facial recognition via Yoti, or linking to official data—will restrict access to Xbox’s online social features like messaging, voice chat, and game invites. However, game ownership and access will remain unaffected. The changes are intended to protect children from harmful online content, in line with new safety guidelines enacted on July 25, 2025, which apply broadly to content-sharing platforms.\n\nThe update has sparked controversy among users who argue that child safety should be managed by parents, not corporations. Critics also question the effectiveness of these measures, suggesting that tech-savvy minors could bypass age checks using VPNs. Microsoft encourages parents to utilize Xbox's parental control tools, but users continue to debate the policy’s implications for privacy and user freedom.

Compliant sites saw significant drops in traffic, while non-compliant porn sites experienced traffic surges—some doubling or tripling their audiences. The law, aimed at protecting minors, utilizes AI and facial recognition tools from contractors like Yoti and Incode. Although supporters argue the measures promote online safety, critics warn of significant risks including privacy breaches, data misuse, and the rise of unregulated, harder-to-monitor platforms.\n\nThe law has also imposed steep financial burdens on smaller websites, with compliance costs reaching millions daily for some. Problems with age estimation algorithms and workarounds like VPNs have undermined its effectiveness. Similar legislation is spreading in the U.S., with 25 states pushing for age verification on not only adult but also social media platforms. These laws have triggered lawsuits over free speech concerns and fears of broader censorship. In some cases, platforms have preemptively blocked access from certain states to avoid compliance expenses. Although UK officials have praised the law, its early implementation has sparked debate over privacy, practicality, and its broader online implications.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756638300.15,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/the-internet-revolutionized-porn-age-verification-could-upend-everything","title":"The Internet Revolutionized Porn. Age Verification Could Upend Everything","snippet":"The article explores how the internet revolutionized the porn industry by giving performers like Siri Dahl unprecedented independence and direct access to audiences through platforms like OnlyFans, Pornhub, and others. However, this autonomy is under threat due to new age-verification laws being enacted in the US and UK, which require users to upload IDs to access adult content. Advocates argue these laws protect minors, while critics contend they undermine privacy, restrict free speech, and could drive both creators and consumers to unsafe, unregulated spaces online.\n\nThe laws are part of broader conservative initiatives, such as Project 2025, which seeks to diminish access to porn entirely. As a result, performers are facing significant drops in income, rising censorship, and legal threats that disproportionately harm marginalized communities and independent creators. The shift away from a decentralized, diverse porn landscape could lead to corporate monopolies dominating content, risking ethical transparency and representation. Many in the industry call for a deeper dialogue on sex education and sexuality, emphasizing that comprehensive sexual understanding—not restrictive regulation—is the best path forward.

While users must now prove they are over 18 to access adult or potentially harmful content, the law also threatens end-to-end encryption, a fundamental layer of online privacy. Section 122, dubbed the \"spy clause,\" originally proposed client-side scanning of encrypted messages to detect illegal content, such as child abuse or terrorism-related material. Amid backlash from tech companies like WhatsApp and Signal, the UK temporarily paused this provision, stating implementation would resume when \"technically feasible.\" \n\nExperts warn that either scanning messages before encryption or inserting surveillance switches into devices would compromise users' privacy and security, effectively enabling mass surveillance. Critics argue this undermines the integrity of encryption, increases the risk of cyberattacks, and sets dangerous precedents. Meanwhile, parallel efforts in the EU, such as \"Chat Control,\" and amendments to the UK's Investigatory Powers Act, further extend government oversight. These changes compel tech firms to seek approval for security upgrades and remove features upon request without notifying users. Overall, the Act marks a broader erosion of digital rights under the guise of online safety.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1755102725,"attribution":"www.techradar.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.wired.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/britain-admits-defeat-online-safety-bill-encryption/","title":"Britain Admits Defeat in Controversial Online Safety Bill","snippet":"Sep 6, 2023 — The UK government has admitted that the technology needed to securely scan encrypted messages sent on Signal and WhatsApp doesn't exist.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1694012340,"attribution":"www.wired.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/britain-admits-defeat-online-safety-bill-encryption","title":"Britain Admits Defeat in Controversial Fight to Break Encryption","snippet":"In a significant development, the British government has conceded to not enforcing a controversial clause in the UK's Online Safety Bill that would have undermined end-to-end encryption.

The clause had faced substantial opposition, with messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Signal threatening to withdraw from the UK if the bill passed.

Meta began implementing end-to-end encryption a year ago, triggering concerns from the National Crime Agency about the increased difficulty in protecting children online. The Home Office document argues that the Online Safety Act is insufficient to quickly address the issue and compel tech companies to develop detection technologies. Despite these concerns, Meta maintains that end-to-end encryption is crucial for online security and has safety measures in place to combat abuse.

The plan met widespread criticism over security risks, potential for surveillance, and concerns about technical feasibility. Despite passing through the UK Parliament in 2017 and designating the British Board of Film Classification to enforce it, there were significant challenges in actual implementation. Issues included determining age verification tools and industry-wide application. Several delays were justified by the government on grounds of technical issues and administrative oversights.

Free speech advocates and privacy experts, however, fear it could lead to internet censorship and create privacy risks by putting personal data in the hands of adult film companies, making it a potential target for hackers. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) will oversee the verification process, marking its first foray into internet regulation. Critics express concerns about effectiveness, the impact on smaller sites, and the potential for broader censorship.

Compliant sites saw significant drops in traffic, while non-compliant porn sites experienced traffic surges—some doubling or tripling their audiences. The law, aimed at protecting minors, utilizes AI and facial recognition tools from contractors like Yoti and Incode. Although supporters argue the measures promote online safety, critics warn of significant risks including privacy breaches, data misuse, and the rise of unregulated, harder-to-monitor platforms.\n\nThe law has also imposed steep financial burdens on smaller websites, with compliance costs reaching millions daily for some. Problems with age estimation algorithms and workarounds like VPNs have undermined its effectiveness. Similar legislation is spreading in the U.S., with 25 states pushing for age verification on not only adult but also social media platforms. These laws have triggered lawsuits over free speech concerns and fears of broader censorship. In some cases, platforms have preemptively blocked access from certain states to avoid compliance expenses. Although UK officials have praised the law, its early implementation has sparked debate over privacy, practicality, and its broader online implications.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756638300.15,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.pcgamer.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/age-verification-legislation-is-tanking-web-traffic-to-sites-that-comply-and-rewarding-those-that-dont/","title":"Age verification legislation is tanking traffic to sites that comply, and rewarding those that don't","snippet":"A new report highlights the unintended consequences of the UK's Online Safety Act, which mandates age verification for adult and social media websites. While the measures aim to protect minors, they have led to a substantial drop in web traffic for sites complying with the law, especially adult websites. In contrast, non-compliant sites have seen a surge in traffic—some even tripling their UK visitor numbers. An analysis of the 90 most visited porn sites revealed that the few which avoided implementing age verification enjoyed increased traffic and likely revenue.\n\nOfcom, the UK's communications regulator, is currently investigating several companies that operate 34 such sites to assess the effectiveness of their age checks. Meanwhile, compliant sites bear the dual burden of reduced traffic and the cost of third-party verification services.\n\nThe legislation has stirred public criticism, with over 500,000 signatures on a petition advocating its repeal—though the UK government maintains no plans to reverse the law. Internationally, similar laws are taking shape, such as in Mississippi, USA, where smaller platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon are choosing to block users from the state rather than implement complex age verification systems. Australia is also exploring nationwide implementation.

Sherwood criticized Ofcom for thus far only investigating small platforms and not holding major companies accountable, despite having the power to impose hefty fines, block services, or pursue criminal charges. Concerns include a loophole exempting companies from content removal if it's not \"technically feasible\" and gaps around end-to-end encryption. Ofcom responded, emphasizing its commitment to full enforcement and noted that several investigations have already been launched. Sherwood argued platforms must choose between strong age verification or ensuring harmful content is eradicated, with vague promises no longer sufficient. He highlighted X (formerly Twitter), which hosts significant adult content, as a platform to watch. Recent events, such as online racial abuse against athletes and misinformation during riots, have further fueled scrutiny of Ofcom’s effectiveness.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753302353,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b79e5ba0bc800bb22261c498af8124","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for NSPCC, 5Rights, and age assurance statements","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"9791a7a459d3f52d-LHR","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"5dbf16bf-dfe7-4feb-8d6e-efb940b0754d","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5dbf16bf-dfe7-4feb-8d6e-efb940b0754d","children":["776c63e6-ef09-4945-b016-d38b767fbbdd"]},"776c63e6-ef09-4945-b016-d38b767fbbdd":{"id":"776c63e6-ef09-4945-b016-d38b767fbbdd","message":{"id":"776c63e6-ef09-4945-b016-d38b767fbbdd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756864914.150324,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Crafting the narrative structure","content":"I’ll structure the narrative like this: \n\n- **Stage 1**: The 2015 Conservative manifesto, 2017 DEA Part 3, privacy and technical objections, delayed and dropped in 2019, integrated into the Online Harms regime.

Age Verification Could Upend Everything","snippet":"The article explores how the internet revolutionized the porn industry by giving performers like Siri Dahl unprecedented independence and direct access to audiences through platforms like OnlyFans, Pornhub, and others. However, this autonomy is under threat due to new age-verification laws being enacted in the US and UK, which require users to upload IDs to access adult content. Advocates argue these laws protect minors, while critics contend they undermine privacy, restrict free speech, and could drive both creators and consumers to unsafe, unregulated spaces online.\n\nThe laws are part of broader conservative initiatives, such as Project 2025, which seeks to diminish access to porn entirely. As a result, performers are facing significant drops in income, rising censorship, and legal threats that disproportionately harm marginalized communities and independent creators. The shift away from a decentralized, diverse porn landscape could lead to corporate monopolies dominating content, risking ethical transparency and representation. Many in the industry call for a deeper dialogue on sex education and sexuality, emphasizing that comprehensive sexual understanding—not restrictive regulation—is the best path forward. Amidst this upheaval, creators like Dahl are continuing advocacy to raise awareness and protect sex worker rights.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756463400,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.washingtonpost.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/31/age-verification-uk-porn-sites/","title":"'Scan your face' laws for the web are having unexpected consequences","snippet":"The United Kingdom's new age-verification law, requiring users to scan their faces or upload IDs to access adult websites, has led to unanticipated consequences. Compliant sites saw significant drops in traffic, while non-compliant porn sites experienced traffic surges—some doubling or tripling their audiences. The law, aimed at protecting minors, utilizes AI and facial recognition tools from contractors like Yoti and Incode. Although supporters argue the measures promote online safety, critics warn of significant risks including privacy breaches, data misuse, and the rise of unregulated, harder-to-monitor platforms.\n\nThe law has also imposed steep financial burdens on smaller websites, with compliance costs reaching millions daily for some. Problems with age estimation algorithms and workarounds like VPNs have undermined its effectiveness. Similar legislation is spreading in the U.S., with 25 states pushing for age verification on not only adult but also social media platforms. These laws have triggered lawsuits over free speech concerns and fears of broader censorship. In some cases, platforms have preemptively blocked access from certain states to avoid compliance expenses. Although UK officials have praised the law, its early implementation has sparked debate over privacy, practicality, and its broader online implications.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756638300.15,"attribution":"www.washingtonpost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.pcgamer.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/age-verification-legislation-is-tanking-web-traffic-to-sites-that-comply-and-rewarding-those-that-dont/","title":"Age verification legislation is tanking traffic to sites that comply, and rewarding those that don't","snippet":"A new report highlights the unintended consequences of the UK's Online Safety Act, which mandates age verification for adult and social media websites. While the measures aim to protect minors, they have led to a substantial drop in web traffic for sites complying with the law, especially adult websites. In contrast, non-compliant sites have seen a surge in traffic—some even tripling their UK visitor numbers. An analysis of the 90 most visited porn sites revealed that the few which avoided implementing age verification enjoyed increased traffic and likely revenue.\n\nOfcom, the UK's communications regulator, is currently investigating several companies that operate 34 such sites to assess the effectiveness of their age checks. Meanwhile, compliant sites bear the dual burden of reduced traffic and the cost of third-party verification services.\n\nThe legislation has stirred public criticism, with over 500,000 signatures on a petition advocating its repeal—though the UK government maintains no plans to reverse the law. Internationally, similar laws are taking shape, such as in Mississippi, USA, where smaller platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon are choosing to block users from the state rather than implement complex age verification systems. Australia is also exploring nationwide implementation. The global trend suggests the internet may become more fragmented in response to rising regulatory demands.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756728822,"attribution":"www.pcgamer.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/24/what-are-the-new-uk-online-safety-rules-and-how-will-they-be-enforced","title":"What are the new UK online safety rules and how will age ...","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753361596,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/08/porn-sites-in-uk-will-have-to-check-ages-in-planned-update-to-online-safety-bill","title":"Porn sites in UK will have to check ages in planned update ...","snippet":"Feb 8, 2022 — The government has revived plans to make pornography websites carry out age checks, which would require British users to provide data such as their credit card ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1644278467,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/18/children-exposure-to-porn-online-safety-act-commissioner","title":"Children's exposure to porn higher than before 2023 ...","snippet":"Aug 18, 2025 — Pornhub and other major adult websites introduced advanced age checks on 25 July after the Online Safety Act said sites must make it harder for ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1755554400,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/uk-online-safety-law-leads-to-5m-extra-age-checks-a-day-and-surge-in-vpn-use","title":"UK online safety law leads to 5m extra age checks a day ...","snippet":"Jul 30, 2025 — Five million extra online age checks a day are being carried out in the UK since the introduction of age-gating for pornography sites, according ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1753892508,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/13/porn-site-traffic-falls-online-safety-act-age-checks","title":"UK traffic to popular porn sites slumps after age checks ...","snippet":"Aug 13, 2025 — British visits to popular pornography sites have slumped following the introduction of strict age checks last month, data shows.

Right-wing critics label it censorship, while left-leaning commentators worry it harms children's safety and online access, reflecting broader distrust across the political spectrum. Billinge explains that the act aims to make tech companies proactively assess and mitigate harmful content—like child abuse material or suicide promotion—via principled, flexible guidelines rather than mandated technologies, reducing overreach concerns.\n\nCritics blame the act for poor platform decisions and censorship, but Billinge argues these practices predate the legislation and are influenced by opaque corporate agendas. Misunderstandings around age verification, like Spotify's approach, and issues with circumvention via VPNs are acknowledged, but seen as teething issues rather than reasons for repeal.\n\nThe article emphasizes that the legislation marks a shift toward greater transparency and responsibility in tech governance. While addressing systemic issues like \"surveillance capitalism\" requires broader reforms, the Online Safety Act is a positive step in regulating platforms’ influence and improving online safety—particularly for children. Billinge urges thoughtful engagement with regulation, not cynical dismissal.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1754061747,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-leading-measures-to-protect-children-from-accessing-pornography-online","title":"World-leading measures to protect children from accessing ...","snippet":"Feb 8, 2022 — Online Safety Bill will force pornography websites to prevent underage access including by using age verification technologies.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1644280201,"attribution":"www.gov.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"en.wikipedia.org","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Safety_Act_2023","title":"Online Safety Act 2023","snippet":"","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756571919,"attribution":"en.wikipedia.org"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"techcrunch.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/08/uk-revives-porn-age-checks/","title":"UK revives age checks for porn sites","snippet":"Feb 8, 2022 — ...

The clause had faced substantial opposition, with messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Signal threatening to withdraw from the UK if the bill passed. Privacy activists and tech companies have hailed the concession as a victory, though the bill still retains these controversial provisions. Critics argue that such measures pave the way for wider government surveillance in the future.

Compliant sites saw significant drops in traffic, while non-compliant porn sites experienced traffic surges—some doubling or tripling their audiences. The law, aimed at protecting minors, utilizes AI and facial recognition tools from contractors like Yoti and Incode. Although supporters argue the measures promote online safety, critics warn of significant risks including privacy breaches, data misuse, and the rise of unregulated, harder-to-monitor platforms.\n\nThe law has also imposed steep financial burdens on smaller websites, with compliance costs reaching millions daily for some. Problems with age estimation algorithms and workarounds like VPNs have undermined its effectiveness. Similar legislation is spreading in the U.S., with 25 states pushing for age verification on not only adult but also social media platforms. These laws have triggered lawsuits over free speech concerns and fears of broader censorship.

This decision follows the government's acknowledgment that technology capable of securely scanning encrypted messages for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) without compromising user privacy does not yet exist. The clause had faced substantial opposition, with messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Signal threatening to withdraw from the UK if the bill passed. Privacy activists and tech companies have hailed the concession as a victory, though the bill still retains these controversial provisions. Critics argue that such measures pave the way for wider government surveillance in the future. Despite the concession, the government maintains that its position on tackling online child sexual abuse has not changed. The implications of this decision are expected to influence global discussions on encryption and privacy, particularly in the European Union where similar debates are ongoing.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":22}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"WIRED"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn3search2turn3search10","start_idx":3839,"end_idx":3872,"safe_urls":["https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/age-checks-to-protect-children-online?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/consultations/category-1-10-weeks/statement-protecting-children-from-harms-online/main-document/volume-1-overview-scope-and-regulatory-approach.pdf?v=396663&utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([www.ofcom.org.uk](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/age-checks-to-protect-children-online?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Age checks to protect children online","url":"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/age-checks-to-protect-children-online?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1737029700,"snippet":"Jan 16, 2025 — Children will be prevented from encountering online pornography and protected from other types of harmful content under Ofcom's new industry guidance.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Volume 1 Overview scope and regulatory approach","url":"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/consultations/category-1-10-weeks/statement-protecting-children-from-harms-online/main-document/volume-1-overview-scope-and-regulatory-approach.pdf?v=396663&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1746782458,"snippet":"Apr 24, 2025 — Services in scope of the children's safety duties now have until 24 July 2025 to complete and record their children's risk assessments, as ...","attribution":"www.ofcom.org.uk"}],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":2},{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":10}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"www.ofcom.org.uk"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn3search11turn0search16","start_idx":3963,"end_idx":3997,"safe_urls":["https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/letter-to-part-3-services-that-allow-pornography-outlining-heaa-requirements?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([www.ofcom.org.uk](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/letter-to-part-3-services-that-allow-pornography-outlining-heaa-requirements?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Letter from Ofcom regarding mandatory age assurance ...","url":"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/letter-to-part-3-services-that-allow-pornography-outlining-heaa-requirements?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1745469700,"snippet":"Apr 24, 2025 — Services in scope of the Online Safety Act and which allow pornography, must implement highly effective age assurance to stop under-18s encountering that ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":3,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"www.ofcom.org.uk"},{"title":"Online Safety Act","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1753311600,"snippet":"24 Jul 2025 — As of 25 July 2025, platforms have a legal duty to protect children online.

The ongoing popularity of Sky News, and the slight bump to GB News over the last couple of years has some impact on this, especially as trust in the BBC has eroded (sometimes for good reasons, like Boris Johnson's personal friend as an appointee, and repeated failures of care, but also sometimes because of agitators turning molehills into mountains explicitly to erode trust in public broadcasting around the world).","async_task_type":"research","async_task_status_messages":{"initial":"Media and Social Media Attitudes Toward Labour Since Mid-2023","completed_with_time":"Research completed in 6m","completed_no_time":"Completed research","completed":"Researched for ","error":"Research failed","cancelled":"Research cancelled"},"b1de6e2_s":true,"command":"start_research_task","request_id":"979273cd2a13ae4b-ZRH","message_type":"next","model_slug":"research","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"7f4d8a8a-f411-49dd-a709-7eae088a2517","timestamp_":"absolute","async_task_id":"deepresch_68b7c1fce3b88191833304185242d9ca","async_task_conversation_id":"68b7c1fc-e5c4-8325-8897-0d190a9213f5","async_task_created_at":"2025-09-03 04:20:14.242417+00:00","deep_research_version":"full"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7f4d8a8a-f411-49dd-a709-7eae088a2517","children":["73cf79c1-6183-44a0-a54c-cfdbe647d0e9"]},"73cf79c1-6183-44a0-a54c-cfdbe647d0e9":{"id":"73cf79c1-6183-44a0-a54c-cfdbe647d0e9","message":{"id":"73cf79c1-6183-44a0-a54c-cfdbe647d0e9","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756873543.66883,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["# Media Climate and Public Sentiment in the UK (2024–2025)\n\n## Major Newspapers: A Dominant Right-Leaning Press\n\nBritain’s national press landscape has long been tilted to the right, with most high-circulation papers taking a conservative or pro-Tory editorial line. A YouGov survey found that out of eight leading newspapers, five were perceived as predominantly right-wing, versus only two seen as left-wing (the *Guardian* and *Daily Mirror*)【42†L315-L324】【42†L326-L334】. This imbalance is widely recognized: 81% of Britons consider the *Daily Mail* right-wing (44% call it “*very* right-wing”), and similarly large majorities categorize the *Sun*, *Telegraph*, *Times*, *Express*, etc., as leaning right【42†L326-L334】. Meanwhile the *Guardian* is seen as the most left-leaning title, followed by the *Mirror*【42†L327-L335】. The *Independent* (now digital-only) is broadly centrist with a slight left-of-center bent【42†L335-L342】. Below is a brief rundown of the “temperature” – i.e. political slant and recent attitude – of each of the most-read UK news outlets (print and online):\n\n- **Daily Mail / Mail on Sunday:** Britain’s highest-impact mid-market tabloid, staunchly conservative and often aggressively critical of Labour. The *Mail* has been described as the nation’s *most* right-wing newspaper【42†L326-L334】, known for harsh campaigns on immigration, “woke” culture, and Euroskepticism. It vehemently supported Boris Johnson through scandals (even after Partygate, under editor Paul Dacre)【29†L95-L103】【29†L123-L131】, and only very late did cracks appear. Since Labour’s resurgence, the *Mail* has kept its “powder relatively dry” on attacking Keir Starmer personally – focusing ire more on his deputy Angela Rayner – but it still clearly favors the Conservatives【24†L243-L252】. With a large readership, the *Mail*’s influence is significant despite low trust ratings (59% of Britons deem it untrustworthy, giving it a net trust score of –37)【18†L329-L337】. Expect its tone to turn even more hostile if Labour falters on any issue.\n\n- **The Sun:** A mass-market tabloid formerly Britain’s highest circulation paper, owned by Rupert Murdoch. Historically the *Sun* backs the likely winner – famously switching to Tony Blair in 1997 – but generally it skews right-populist and strongly pro-Conservative. During Johnson’s tenure it was loyal; it only soured when public anger grew over scandals【29†L95-L103】. The *Sun* greeted the 2024 election news not with enthusiasm for Sunak but with grumbling about a “spoilt summer,” suggesting lukewarm support for the embattled Tories【24†L256-L264】. It has a sensationalist, anti-“political correctness” tone and often attacks Labour figures (it spent years demonizing Jeremy Corbyn). However, Murdoch papers also prefer to *“back winners”*, so if polls showed an inevitable Labour win, the *Sun* might moderate its tone【24†L255-L264】. Public trust in the *Sun* is abysmal – it’s the single most distrusted outlet in the UK (net trust –53)【18†L327-L334】 – reflecting its reputation for slanted and sometimes reckless coverage.\n\n- **Daily Telegraph:** The traditional Tory broadsheet, unwaveringly conservative. The *Telegraph* has **never** endorsed any party other than the Conservatives and is regarded as a *“true blue”* paper【22†L221-L229】. It consistently amplifies right-wing talking points – e.g. warning of Labour’s “socialist agenda” or branding a Starmer-led government a *“catastrophe”*【22†L197-L206】【22†L223-L231】. Recently, internal turmoil (the Barclay family’s debt default put the paper in limbo) has made it even more strident. In the 2024 campaign its columnists were in full attack mode (“1000 hours to save Britain” from Labour’s tyranny, etc.)【22†L197-L204】. The likely new owner is a Murdoch ally (GB News co-owner Sir Paul Marshall), which suggests the *Telegraph* will remain a loud champion of Conservative populist causes【22†L229-L236】. While its print circulation is smaller than the tabloids, it influences the Tory base and MPs heavily. (Public perception: strongly right-wing, though seen as slightly more serious/centrist than the Mail or *Express*.)\n\n- **The Times:** A Murdoch-owned broadsheet with a center-right, establishment orientation. The *Times* is seen as the most moderate of the right-leaning papers【42†L341-L348】. It generally supports Conservatives but with a more measured tone and quality reporting. Notably, the *Times* eventually called for Johnson’s resignation in July 2022, one day before he quit – “scarcely counting” as brave, but still earlier than other Tory papers【29†L101-L109】. During the lead-up to the 2024 election, the *Times* took a relatively balanced approach: its editorials acknowledged Sunak’s “dreadful hand” but stressed that *both* leaders would be severely tested in the campaign【24†L258-L264】. It did not dive into the frenzied anti-Starmer rhetoric of the tabloids, at least initially. The *Times* aims to retain credibility whichever party wins, and Murdoch’s strategy of hedging bets was evident (his outlets remained *“even more fence-sitting than usual”* as Labour’s lead grew)【24†L255-L264】. Overall, expect the *Times* to scrutinize Labour’s policies but in a less overtly partisan way, and possibly to adjust its editorial stance if Labour secures business confidence. (Trust: The *Times* enjoys moderate public trust for a newspaper, net +14【18†L323-L331】.)\n\n- **Daily Express:** A right-wing tabloid known for its hyperbolic headlines (“*EU to ruin Britain*”-style stories, constant focus on immigration, pensioners, and Princess Diana conspiracies in years past). The *Express* strongly backed Brexit and Tory hardliners. It often campaigns on issues like stopping migrant boats and slashing taxes, aligning with the Conservative right or even Farage’s rhetoric. Under billionaire Richard Desmond and now Reach PLC, its tone remains vehemently anti-Labour. During Corbyn’s era it issued dire warnings about “Marxist” Labour; under Starmer it continues to push that any Labour government would spell disaster. Its circulation is smaller than the *Sun* or *Mail*, but it targets an older demographic (and often stokes their fears). Public trust in the *Express* is very low (net –31)【18†L331-L334】. In the current climate, the *Express* can be expected to join the *Telegraph/Mail* chorus in blaming Labour for societal ills while glossing over Tory-era failings.\n\n- **The Guardian / Observer:** Britain’s leading left-of-center newspaper (the daily *Guardian* and its Sunday stablemate *Observer*). The *Guardian* has a liberal, pro-Labour (or at least anti-Tory) orientation, though it often holds Labour accountable from a progressive standpoint. It was critical of Corbyn at times, but also relentlessly exposed Conservative scandals. Among the public, it’s viewed as the most left-wing mainstream paper【42†L331-L338】. Trust in the *Guardian* is relatively high for a newspaper – about one-third of Britons trust it, and it enjoys a positive net trust (+15)【18†L317-L325】【18†L321-L329】. In terms of reach, the *Guardian* punches above its weight online; Ofcom finds it (with the *Observer*) among the two most widely read digital news titles (on par with *Daily Mail*’s online reach)【39†L323-L331】【39†L333-L340】. In the past year, the *Guardian* has unsurprisingly been *less* hostile to Starmer’s Labour than the right-wing press. It provides a platform for voices supportive of the need for change after 14 years of Tory rule. However, it also features commentary from its left flank that chides Starmer for centrist compromises or calls for more radical action. Overall “temperature”: broadly pro-Labour, but with a critical eye. (Notably, ex-PM Tony Blair recently gave *Observer* interviews praising Starmer and advising him to ignore *“vicious”* abuse on social media【44†L193-L202】, reflecting the paper’s role as a forum for Labour’s internal debates.)\n\n- **Daily Mirror:** The *Mirror* is the major national paper consistently supportive of the Labour Party. A tabloid for a working-class audience, it has a proudly Labour/social democratic lineage. The *Mirror* broke the Partygate scandal story in late 2021, showing its willingness to take on the Tory government【29†L193-L201】. During elections, it unabashedly backs Labour (in 2019 its front pages railed against Boris Johnson). In the current milieu, the *Mirror* strongly champions Starmer’s policies and attacks “Broken Britain” issues left by the Conservatives – though it may criticize Labour from the left if it feels promises to workers are watered down. Despite its noble history, the *Mirror*’s readership has declined and it’s far outnumbered by the combined reach of right-wing tabloids【42†L373-L381】. Public trust mirrors that partisan split: while Labour voters trust it, many Conservatives dismiss the *Mirror* – giving it a net trust of –37 (identical to the *Mail*, but coming from the opposite political perception)【18†L331-L334】. In sum, the *Mirror* remains a loud pro-Labour voice, but its influence is limited next to the Tory-leaning press.\n\n- **The Independent (online) and “i” paper:** The *Independent* ceased print in 2016 but continues as a digital outlet with significant online readership. Its stance is centrist to centre-left, pro-EU, and broadly favoring liberal internationalist viewpoints. It often publishes commentary supportive of Labour or critical of Tory policies, though it’s not as overtly partisan as the *Mirror*. The *Independent* is actually one of the most *trusted* newspaper brands by the public (net trust +16, slightly above the *Guardian*)【18†L319-L327】. The **i** (which was originally a spin-off of the *Independent*) is a small print daily and online site that aims for unbiased reporting. It has no partisan allegiance, but in editorial tone it tends to be factual and moderate – any lean is subtle (some consider it slightly left-of-center on social issues). Neither the *Indy* nor *i* has the reach of the big tabloids, but they contribute to balancing the discourse.  \n\n- **Financial Times:** A niche but influential paper, the *FT* caters to business and financial readers. It has a generally pro-market, pro-globalization outlook, and it opposed Brexit. Politically the *FT* often endorses more centrist or economically competent choices – for instance, it has endorsed Conservative or Liberal Democrat candidates in the past, but also supported Tony Blair’s New Labour. In the 2019–2023 period it was highly critical of Brexit hardliners and the economic turmoil under Johnson/Truss. Come 2024, the *FT*’s editorial line was cautiously favorable to Starmer (viewing him as a pragmatic centrist who might restore stability). Notably, the *FT* is the single most trusted news outlet in Britain by net score – 40% trust it vs only 10% distrust (+30 net)【18†L310-L318】. Its readership is small in number but powerful in influence (corporate and policy elites). In the media mix, the *FT* provides more neutral, analytical coverage rather than the populist attacks seen in the tabloids.\n\n*Overall*, the print/online press in late 2023 and 2024 created what many observers call a **hostile media environment** for the Labour Party. Well before the general election, the conservative papers were on the offensive. By May 2024, as the campaign kicked off, right-wing outlets were effectively treating Labour as a dangerous threat to Britain – Allister Heath in the *Telegraph* warned there were “just 1,000 hours to save Britain” from Starmer’s “tyranny”【22†L197-L204】, and the *Mail* and *Express* consistently ran stories undermining Labour proposals. This hostility is not new (Jeremy Corbyn faced *“overwhelmingly negative”* press coverage in 2019【19†L215-L224】【19†L220-L228】), but some argue it has reached new heights. An academic analysis during the 2019 campaign showed newspaper coverage gave Boris Johnson’s Conservatives a net positive tone while Corbyn’s Labour was hammered with around **75% net negative** tone【19†L219-L227】【19†L220-L228】. In 2024, early Loughborough University media audits indicated a similar or worse imbalance, though notably as the election neared, even some right-leaning papers hedged their bets when a Labour victory looked likely【24†L255-L264】【24†L273-L278】. \n\nNow that Labour is in government (after 14 years in opposition), the press scrutiny has, if anything, intensified. Within the first year of Starmer’s premiership, pundits noted *“relentless criticism of the Labour Government from a hostile media”* – to the point of **questioning its legitimacy to govern**【25†L103-L111】【25†L145-L153】. Every policy hiccup or tough decision (e.g. trimming the universal winter fuel allowance) has been seized upon as a “betrayal” or “own goal” in media narratives【25†L147-L155】. Meanwhile, the same outlets devote far less attention to context – such as the 14-year legacy of Conservative austerity and economic stagnation that set the stage【25†L153-L161】. For example, Professor Chris Painter observes that outlets hammer Labour for painful choices while saying *“relatively little about”* how Tory policies protected wealthy pensioners at the expense of younger workers and public services【25†L153-L161】. In other words, much of the press has exhibited a double standard: quick to blame Labour for “everything wrong with Britain” (as if the country’s crises started on Day 1 of the new government) while glossing over the mess left behind by their preferred party. Some attack lines have verged on the hyperbolic – painting Starmerism as either a re-heated redux of Blair destined for failure, or tarring Starmer as an authoritarian figure, depending on the outlet【25†L163-L170】. This *all-guns-blazing* approach so soon into a Labour administration is indeed, as the user notes, even more hostile than the press was toward the late-stage Tory government. (Recall that many papers **stayed loyal** to Boris Johnson “right to the bitter end” despite his *“venality and systematic lying”*, only turning on him when public anger over Partygate made his position untenable【29†L95-L103】【29†L118-L126】.) The contrast is stark – a Tory PM was given the benefit of the doubt for years, whereas the new Labour PM faced furious press attacks within weeks. \n\nIt’s worth mentioning that newspaper influence, while still significant, is not quite as dominant as in decades past. Print circulations are a fraction of what they once were, and younger audiences get their news online or via social media far more. Nonetheless, the agenda-setting power of tabloids and broadsheets remains strong, especially in TV discussion and online news aggregation. And collectively, the readership of right-leaning papers still vastly exceeds that of left-leaning ones【42†L373-L381】, meaning a majority of daily news consumers are indeed imbibing a generally anti-Labour media tone.\n\n## Broadcast News: Trust, Shifts and “Culture War” Channels\n\nTelevision and radio remain key news sources in the UK – with a reputation (at least historically) for greater impartiality than the press. Among TV news outlets, **BBC News** has long been dominant in reach, though not without recent challenges. As of 2023, BBC1’s news bulletins were still the single most-used news source (about 49% of adults get news from BBC1)【36†L219-L227】【36†L231-L239】, and the BBC’s combined TV, radio and online reach dwarfs any other provider (more than double the weekly audience of its nearest competitor)【34†L289-L297】. However, the BBC’s position is gradually *eroding*: its audience reach has been *“falling over time, especially with younger audiences”*【14†L276-L284】, and public trust in the BBC has declined amid political polarization. Only 42% of Britons now say they trust the BBC to tell the truth, while 53% express little or no trust – a net negative sentiment【31†L329-L337】【31†L330-L338】. (Two decades ago, trust in the BBC was much higher; one poll noted a **43-point drop** in trust since 2003【30†L1-L4】.) This erosion of trust comes from both sides of the spectrum: segments of the right see the BBC as having a liberal or “Remainer” bias, while segments of the left accuse it of having been too soft on the Tories (especially under a Conservative-appointed BBC chairman). The BBC has faced **intense scrutiny** and controversy in recent years – from the Richard Sharp scandal (a Boris Johnson ally installed as BBC chair) to rows over how it handled presenters’ social media (e.g. the Gary Lineker impartiality saga)【34†L285-L293】【34†L323-L331】. All this has fed into what one analyst calls a “*vocal minority*” attacking the BBC and public media, even as a “silent majority” continues to use and value it【34†L301-L309】【34†L303-L311】. Notably, despite the noise, impartial broadcasters like BBC, ITV and Channel 4 *remain* the most trusted news sources overall【34†L337-L345】. Surveys consistently find the **BBC, ITV News, and Channel 4 News at the top of trust rankings**, well ahead of any newspaper【18†L315-L323】【18†L317-L325】. For example, in 2023 net trust scores were strongly positive for ITV (+28) and Channel 4 (+27), and +23 for BBC News【18†L315-L323】. So while the BBC’s halo has slipped a bit, it’s still trusted more than most – just not by certain partisan fringes.\n\n**Sky News** (the 24-hour news channel) is another major player, generally regarded as a straight news provider with no obvious bias. Sky, being a commercial broadcaster, doesn’t have a formal impartiality mandate as strict as the BBC’s, but in practice it has maintained a solid reputation. It draws a sizable viewership, though less than the BBC’s total reach. Sky News is seen as relatively trustworthy (net trust +13)【18†L317-L324】. During the turbulent recent years, Sky’s political coverage – e.g. tough interviews by journalists like Beth Rigby or Kay Burley – won respect as they held Conservative ministers to account. Sky did not shy from covering Partygate or government failings extensively, which likely contributed to some Conservatives grumbling about it, but overall it’s not seen as having a partisan slant akin to newspapers. Sky’s audience is smaller and older than it used to be (many younger people now get clips via YouTube or social media), but it remains an important source, especially at times of breaking news or election nights. Notably, Sky has also tried to fend off the new “opinionated” competitors by emphasizing its commitment to fact-based reporting【15†L9-L17】.\n\nIn the past few years, **new entrants on the airwaves with explicit ideological tilts** have emerged – most prominently **GB News** (launched 2021) and **TalkTV** (launched 2022). These are often likened to U.S.-style partisan cable news. **GB News** pitches itself as an anti-“woke” channel giving a voice to “silenced” views; in practice it leans strongly rightward (many presenters are Tory-aligned or from right-wing media). Initially ridiculed for low production quality and tiny audiences, GB News has slowly grown a niche following. By 2023 it reached about *6–7% of UK adults weekly*【34†L337-L345】【34†L346-L354】 – a small but non-trivial audience, **“the same as the free Metro newspaper and more than any other national newspaper”** in weekly reach, according to the Reuters Institute【34†L343-L351】【34†L347-L355】. Its viewers are mostly older, male, and politically on the right【34†L349-L357】. GB News made headlines by occasionally beating the long-established BBC News Channel in certain time slots by 2025 (particularly prime-time opinion shows)【32†L293-L301】【32†L303-L311】. In July 2025, for example, GB News averaged ~80k viewers across the day, narrowly above the BBC News channel’s ~78k – though in total weekly reach the BBC channel was still twice as large【32†L271-L279】. GB News cleverly keeps its core viewers engaged for longer periods, boosting average audience metrics【32†L273-L281】【32†L275-L283】. However, **trust in GB News is extremely low among the general public** – only ~24% say they trust it to tell the truth【31†L329-L337】【31†L331-L335】. In fact, GB News is the *least trusted* UK news broadcaster, and the only one with a net negative trust rating (–15) as of 2025【15†L13-L16】. This reflects that outside its fan base, many view it as pushing a partisan agenda and even misinformation. (Ofcom has sanctioned GB News multiple times for breaches of impartiality rules and airing inaccurate or offensive content【22†L189-L197】【22†L199-L207】.) Still, its *existence* has some impact: it pulls the political conversation rightward on certain issues (e.g. culture-war topics) and has put pressure on other broadcasters to not ignore stories that galvanize GB News’s audience.\n\n**TalkTV**, a Murdoch-owned entrant (with personalities like Piers Morgan), has had even lower ratings than GB News and similarly low trust. These channels together represent an experiment in importing a Fox News-style model. **So far, British audiences have not broadly embraced partisan TV news** – the majority still prefer the traditional broadcasters【34†L337-L345】【34†L347-L355】. Reuters Institute data noted that while GB News is “building an audience,” Britons overall *have not* endorsed highly opinionated news: *“the American model is still struggling for acceptance”* in the UK【34†L349-L357】【34†L355-L359】. That said, these channels have amplified certain narratives (often anti-Labour, anti-immigration, anti-net-zero, etc.), contributing to the hostile media climate for the current government.\n\nIt’s also important to mention **ITV News and Channel 4 News**. **ITV News** (including the flagship *News at Ten* and regional bulletins) remains widely watched (34% use ITV as a news source)【36†L219-L227】 and enjoys high trust across the spectrum【18†L315-L323】. ITV’s political coverage is generally seen as neutral; for instance, during Partygate, ITV’s UK editor Robert Peston faced criticism of being *too soft* on Johnson at times, but ITV also broke some key scoops (the infamous Downing Street party video was leaked to ITV News). **Channel 4 News**, a nightly program, is known for rigorous investigative journalism and has a reputation (especially on the right) of being a bit left-leaning. Some Conservative politicians accuse Channel 4 of liberal bias – indeed right-wing voters are more likely to perceive it as favouring Labour【18†L339-L347】. But it’s still a public-service broadcaster bound by impartiality rules, and its reports have held *all* governments to account. Channel 4 News is one of the most trusted news sources (often topping trust polls alongside the BBC)【18†L315-L323】. In recent years, the Johnson government’s attempt to **privatize Channel 4** was seen by many as retaliation for its fearless coverage. (That plan was dropped after outcry.) \n\nFinally, **news consumption habits** are shifting overall. Traditional TV news is losing young viewers to online streaming and social media. But one silver lining for reliable broadcasters: *when big breaking stories happen, people still flock to the BBC and Sky*【15†L9-L17】. The Queen’s death in 2022, for example, drew tens of millions to BBC coverage【34†L307-L315】. This suggests that despite noise about bias, the public largely knows where to turn for sober reporting in serious moments. With an election due in 2024, the BBC even launched initiatives like **BBC Verify** to fact-check misinformation in real time【14†L278-L284】, trying to shore up trust. The *bottom line* is that TV news remains a key pillar of information – and while new challengers nibble at the edges, the likes of BBC/ITV/C4 are still critical in shaping public opinion, and they are generally less hostile to any party than the print tabloids. (Even so, the government – whether Tory or Labour – often accuses the BBC of bias whenever coverage displeases it, so the perception of neutrality is continuously tested.)\n\n## Social Media Sentiment: Polarized and “Vicious”\n\nThe **social media** landscape in Britain is vast and fractured, making it hard to quantify a single “general attitude.” Platforms like **Facebook** and **Twitter (X)** host millions of users engaging in political debate – often in highly partisan echo chambers. What is clear is that online discourse can be *extremely hostile* and reactive, amplifying criticisms and conspiracies far faster than traditional media. As the user alludes, there have been concerted efforts by various actors to erode trust in institutions (from the BBC to electoral systems) via social networks. Agitators and disinformation peddlers can turn “molehills into mountains,” seizing on minor issues to stoke outrage and deepen cynicism toward public broadcasters or governments.\n\nOne notable trend is that **social media tends to swing against whoever is in power**, though not in a balanced way. Under the Conservative government of 2010–2024, especially in its latter years, hashtags like **#ToriesOut** and viral posts lambasting Tory austerity or scandal were rampant. Public Facebook groups and Twitter activists played a role in shaping the narrative that Britain was broken under the Tories. Conversely, since Labour took office, one can observe a surge in posts attacking Starmer’s government from multiple sides – right-wing commentators labeling it incompetent or too “woke,” and hard-left voices accusing it of not being true socialism. Former PM Tony Blair warned Starmer about exactly this phenomenon, advising him to *“ignore the ‘vicious’ social media platforms”* where *“inevitable criticism will rain down”* on any leader【44†L193-L202】【44†L203-L211】. Blair noted that doom-scrolling through online abuse can *“do your head in”* and that a Prime Minister must filter out the noise to stay focused【44†L193-L202】【44†L205-L213】. In essence, the *temperature* on social media is often boiling – an unfiltered torrent of both genuine public grievances and orchestrated trolling.\n\nStudies of social media mood show a mixed picture. Polling indicates that **partisanship heavily skews perceptions and online engagement**. For instance, supporters of the right-wing Reform UK party exhibit dramatically low trust in almost all institutions and mainstream media – except they *do* trust content from outlets like GB News on social media【31†L329-L337】【31†L371-L379】. Meanwhile, left-leaning users might trust BBC/Guardian posts but dismiss anything from *Daily Mail* or *Sun* as propaganda. This means on Facebook or Twitter, you’ll find parallel universes: in one, Labour can do no right; in another, Labour can do no wrong and every problem is still the Tories’ fault. Surveys by YouGov underline this polarization. For example, among 2019 Labour voters, trust in outlets like Channel 4 or the *Guardian* is sky-high, whereas virtually none trust the *Daily Mail* or GB News; conversely, Tory voters trust the *Mail* and GB News much more and distrust left media【18†L339-L348】【18†L355-L363】. These biases carry over into who people follow and believe on social platforms.\n\nOn specific issues, social media can whip up storms that then influence mainstream coverage. For instance, during the 2023 Israel-Gaza conflict, Starmer’s cautious stance drew enormous backlash on platforms like Twitter, with hashtags demanding a Gaza ceasefire and accusing him of complicity. That online furor translated into real-world pressure on Labour (protests, petitions) and plenty of negative headlines. Similarly, policies like the mentioned ID checks or benefits changes can trend on social media with claims that *“Labour betrays [group]…” which spread long before official communications counter them.* The **speed and venom** of social media criticism often far outpaces what print papers write. Even moderate policies can be met with viral outrage if framed evocatively in a tweet or TikTok. Politicians from all parties now monitor social trends closely – though as Blair suggested, doing so obsessively can be paralyzing.\n\nIt’s also worth noting the **decline of traditional forums** like comment sections or moderated message boards in favor of algorithm-driven feeds. This has contributed to more insular “tribes” on social apps. **Facebook** remains a major source of news for about 30% of adults【36†L219-L227】, but its algorithms tend to reinforce existing views (and Facebook has been rife with misleading memes and angry group posts). **Twitter (X)**, used by ~17% for news【36†L235-L243】, is the loudest for political journalists – trends there often make it into news reports. However, Twitter’s credibility has taken a hit, especially after Elon Musk’s takeover led to an increase in hate speech and misinformation【43†L9-L14】. The UK government even noted concerns about **misinformation on social media inciting real-world disturbances**, e.g. in Southport 2023 a false child-kidnapping rumor spread on Facebook led to violence, prompting Starmer to warn tech firms to crack down【43†L35-L43】. **TikTok** and **Instagram** are growing as news sources for younger people (TikTok news usage jumped to ~10% in 2023)【34†L262-L270】【34†L272-L280】, and while political content there is often apolitical or infotainment, it can still drive narratives (e.g. short clips of MPs going viral, or partisan influencers appealing to youth).\n\nIn summary, the **social media attitude is highly charged and often negative**. There is a sense of *perpetual outrage* online: under the Tories it was outrage at austerity and scandals; now much is outrage that Labour isn’t fixing everything overnight – and concurrently, outrage from others that Labour is changing *anything* at all. This aligns with polls showing Britons are very pessimistic about the state of the country (80%+ say Britain is in a bad state) and cynical about politics【40†L335-L343】【40†L346-L354】, which social media both reflects and amplifies. The **“Broken Britain”** discourse plays out heavily online: every NHS crisis, crime incident, or cost-of-living woe is seized upon as evidence of national decline, with users quick to assign blame (often hashtagging either #ToryChaos or #LabourFail depending on tribe). Such discourse is often *less tempered* than traditional media; there’s no editor to tone down a viral post claiming “Britain is finished, thanks Keir!” or, on the flip side, “14 years of Tory ruin!” \n\nInterestingly, while social media can distort perceptions of media bias (people in echo chambers think *all* media is against them – a classic **hostile media effect**), objective research suggests most Britons still agree on basic expectations for news. They want accuracy, fairness, and holding power to account【11†L101-L110】【11†L113-L121】. The challenge is that online, it’s easy to find a version of “news” that aligns with one’s anger. Thus, the general social media mood is one of **heightened skepticism and blunt hostility** toward whichever leaders are in the crosshairs at the moment. Starmer’s government will need a thick skin: as Blair noted, *“torrents of criticism… just come with the territory”* now【44†L201-L209】【44†L211-L218】. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the current UK media environment, a newly installed Labour administration faces stiff headwinds. The **newspapers with the largest reach predominantly lean right**, and many have turned up the volume on anti-Labour rhetoric – in some cases even *more* ferociously than they criticized the preceding Conservative regime. This persistent bias is borne out by independent analyses of coverage and is perceived by the public at large (e.g. most Britons recognize the press is largely right-wing)【42†L315-L324】【42†L373-L381】. A few left-leaning outlets exist to present the other side, but they are outnumbered in circulation. On the **broadcast side**, public service media still strive for balance and retain higher trust, yet they too are under pressure – from political actors chipping away at their credibility and from upstart channels pushing polarized content. Meanwhile, **social media** acts as an amplifier of criticism and crisis, often painting an even bleaker picture and spreading discontent (sometimes fairly, sometimes not). \n\nAll these factors create a media atmosphere that can fairly be described as *hostile* for the governing Labour Party. The press’s traditional role of holding power to account is one thing – and indeed robust scrutiny is vital – but the current tenor often crosses into outright antagonism and one-sided blame. The risk is that media narratives scapegoat the current government for “Broken Britain” while letting the previous incumbents’ culpability fade from memory. For readers and viewers, navigating this landscape requires awareness of each source’s slant. As our sources show, the British public is increasingly aware of bias and many have lost trust in media generally, contributing to news avoidance and cynicism【34†L331-L339】【34†L333-L341】. Yet, understanding these dynamics is the first step to critically evaluating the daily barrage of headlines and tweets. \n\nFor Labour, dealing with this environment means expecting harsh coverage no matter what – and communicating directly to the public where possible (through trusted forums or even their own social channels) to counteract misinformation. The year 2024–2025 has demonstrated that Britain’s media climate remains as polarized as its politics, if not more. The tabloids and certain TV segments will likely continue casting the country’s problems as *“Labour’s fault”*, even as more even-handed outlets remind us of the longer trajectory that led here. It will be up to discerning citizens to parse the noise – and up to media scholars and independent voices to keep shining a light on how news is being framed. As one Guardian columnist wryly noted during the election, the right-wing media were frantically trying to “save Britain” from Labour while also desperately trying to **save themselves** in a changing media age【22†L181-L189】【22†L187-L194】. In that struggle, truth can be a casualty. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n- Loughborough University Centre for Research in Communication & Culture – real-time general election media analysis (2019 & 2024)【19†L219-L227】【24†L255-L264】  \n- *The Independent* – report on hostile press coverage during 2019 election【19†L215-L223】【19†L220-L228】  \n- YouGov – surveys on trust in media and perceived bias of outlets【18†L323-L331】【18†L329-L337】【42†L326-L334】  \n- Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2023 & 2024 – UK media usage and trust data【34†L337-L345】【34†L343-L351】【14†L276-L284】  \n- *The Guardian* – Jane Martinson column on media backing of parties (May 2024)【22†L197-L206】【24†L258-L264】; Observer interview with Tony Blair on social media (Sep 2024)【44†L193-L202】【44†L203-L211】  \n- *Byline Times* – analysis of media hostility toward Starmer’s government (Jan 2025)【25†L103-L111】【25†L153-L161】  \n- *Prospect Magazine* – Peter Oborne on how the Tory press propped up Boris Johnson (Aug 2022)【29†L95-L103】【29†L123-L131】  \n- Ofcom – News Consumption in the UK 2023 report (top news sources and readership)【36†L219-L227】【39†L323-L331】  \n- Prolific North / Press Gazette – data on GB News vs BBC News channel ratings (July 2025)【32†L293-L301】【32†L303-L311】  \n\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":445,"end_ix":459,"citation_format_type":"tether_v4","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"How left or right-wing are the UK’s newspapers? | YouGov","url":"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/17715-how-left-or-right-wing-are-uks-newspapers#:~:text=Of%20the%20eight%20national%20newspapers,as%20a%20broadly%20centrist%20publication","text":"Of the eight national newspapers we asked about, five were seen to be predominantly right-wing, whilst two were seen as predominantly left-wing.

Over 700 journalists lost their jobs at Reach, the publisher of the Daily Mirror and Express along with 120 local papers, reducing staff by a third since 2016. Reach's heavy reliance on digital advertising, driven by CEO Jim Mullen's strategy, has led to declining revenues, exacerbated by changes in Facebook's algorithms. The Mirror's circulation has plummeted from 5 million in its prime to just 245,829 last year. Despite being the fourth largest news website in the UK, online advertising revenues are insufficient to cover costs.

In contrast to the broader trend, it recorded only a 2.4% drop in print circulation in 2024—significantly lower than the typical 16% fall among UK weekly titles. Owned by Newsquest since 2015 and based in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, the paper maintains a strong investigative focus and recently revamped under editor Rodney Edwards. Its hard-hitting journalism—ranging from sexual abuse exposés to illegal puppy farms—has boosted its reputation and digital reach, earning it the “Local Weekly of the Year” award in 2024. While local media across the UK struggles against Big Tech competition, loss of ad revenue, and AI content theft, The Impartial Reporter has thrived by investing in exclusive reporting and digital innovation. Experts and industry leaders remain hopeful for local journalism’s future, emphasizing the enduring public appetite for community reporting despite ongoing financial and structural challenges.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1748610026.479,"attribution":"www.ft.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/93efa90e-128c-4885-a7b8-4d0ea5f17d52","title":"Mirror and Express publisher hit by advertising drop and Meta shift","snippet":"Reach, the UK’s largest commercial news publisher, saw its pre-tax profits nearly halve last year due to a decline in advertising and a sharp fall in digital readership. The reduced traffic was influenced by Facebook's decision to stop supporting news and changes to Google's search algorithms. Reach's annual pre-tax profits dropped 45% to £36.7 million, while revenue fell by over 5% to £568.6 million. Despite the financial setbacks, shares rose by over 10% after resolving longstanding financial issues related to phone-hacking claims and pension commitments. The decline in digital page views has led to job cuts, with Reach reducing about 450 positions last year. Moving forward, Reach plans to continue providing free content rather than introducing paywalls, despite the changing landscape of social media traffic and the advertising market.

The Sun's coverage, including stories about Huw Edwards and the Royal family, continues to attract readers. Financially, News Group Newspapers (NGN) reduced its operating losses by 85% to £9.2 million. Furthermore, statutory losses, including legal costs, decreased by almost three-quarters to £18 million, supported by a Fox Corp indemnity. Legal costs fell significantly, contributing to reduced losses, and NGN's revenues dropped 2% to £296.3 million, primarily due to a decline in advertising revenue from social media firms.

Social media is also central—**52% of UK adults use it for news**.

However, *The Impartial Reporter* is thriving thanks to investigative local journalism.  \nciteturn0news21turn0search31  \n- **National tabloids** like *The Sun* still lead in overall reach—~23 million UK adults in FY 2024, plus the biggest YouTube channel for a UK newspaper.  \nciteturn0news25\n\n#### 4. **Digital Footprint & Sharing Behavior**  \n- **The Guardian** remains a powerhouse online—its news site reaches ~23 million UK adults per month and is widely trusted—especially its free access model fuels sharing.  \nciteturn0search29turn0search12  \n- **The i** has built strong digital trust and breadth: once the most trusted digital news brand and award-winning. Its readable style without paywalls increases shareability.  \nciteturn0search32  \n- Publications like *The Times* are behind paywalls. While they have decent digital subscriptions (~600,000 by late 2024), paywalls limit shareability beyond their subscriber base.  \nciteturn0search26\n\n#### 5. **News Sharing Patterns on Social Media**  \n- Older academic work shows news sharing forms echo chambers—people mostly share from sources aligned with their existing views. *Guardian* and *i* perform well in left-leaning networks; tabloids perform in right-leaning circles.  \nciteturn0academia28  \n- Local news sharing via Twitter (dataset from UKTwitNewsCor) reveals strong but *localized* engagement—not typically going viral beyond regional audiences.  \nciteturn0academia30\n\n---\n\n###  Summary: Who Influences UK Public Ideas, and How?\n\n| Outlet / Platform        | Influence Mode                       | Effect on Public Opinion                                  |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **BBC / ITV / C4**       | Broadcast & online video             | High trust and reach—primary agenda setters               |\n| **Social Media & Aggregators** | Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Google   | Massive reach; amplifies news and shapes discourse        |\n| **Sun / Mail (tabloids)**| Print + digital reach                | Still broad exposure, though less digital shareability    |\n| **Guardian / i**         | Online free access                   | High shareability, trust—shaping digital networks         |\n| **The Times**            | Paywalled quality content             | Influence focused on subscriber audiences, less viral     |\n| **Local Papers**         | Granular community presence          | Trusted locally, but limited national impact               |\n\n---\n\n###  Bottom Line — “Where Do British People Get Their Ideas?”  \n\n- **TV news remains influential**, particularly via the BBC and ITV—trusted and still front-of-mind for many.  \n- **Online news consumption** is vast and diversifying, but **traditional newspapers—particularly tabloids—have lost share**, especially digitally.  \n- **The Guardian and i** punch above their weight in shaping what gets shared and discussed, due to trust and accessible formats.  \n- **Tabloids like The Sun maintain raw exposure**, but their online reach depends more on brand strength than engagement.  \n- **Paywalled outlets** reach fewer people and exert influence in narrower circles.  \n- **Local journalism remains relevant in communities**, but lacks national reach.\n\nIn social media realms, users **share what they can access openly** and trust—thus, the *Guardian* and *i* commonly inform public discourse via reposts, whereas paywalled content or tabloids may not.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The public’s ideas are shaped by a complex mix—**trusted broadcasters for mass presence**, **free trusted journalism (like Guardian & i) for digital spread**, **tabloid reach for attention**, and **local media for neighborhood influence**. Social media amplifies what's available, trusted, and emotionally resonant, meaning accessible, high-trust platforms disproportionately steer public conversation—even if they don’t have the absolute largest brand.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to deep-dive specific genres (e.g., politics vs lifestyle), generational differences, or platform-by-platform breakdowns!\n\nnavlistFurther reading on UK news consumption trendsturn0news20,turn0news21"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"Here’s a **quick but insightful \"thinking‑mode\"** analysis of how different UK news publications—print and digital—shape public opinion through consumption *and* sharing, particularly in the UK.

In contrast to the broader trend, it recorded only a 2.4% drop in print circulation in 2024—significantly lower than the typical 16% fall among UK weekly titles. Owned by Newsquest since 2015 and based in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, the paper maintains a strong investigative focus and recently revamped under editor Rodney Edwards. Its hard-hitting journalism—ranging from sexual abuse exposés to illegal puppy farms—has boosted its reputation and digital reach, earning it the “Local Weekly of the Year” award in 2024. While local media across the UK struggles against Big Tech competition, loss of ad revenue, and AI content theft, The Impartial Reporter has thrived by investing in exclusive reporting and digital innovation. Experts and industry leaders remain hopeful for local journalism’s future, emphasizing the enduring public appetite for community reporting despite ongoing financial and structural challenges.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21}],"hue":null,"attributions":null},{"title":"Decline of newspapers","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_newspapers?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1754978310,"snippet":"","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":31}],"hue":null,"attributions":null}],"status":"done","error":null,"style":"v2"},{"matched_text":"**National tabloids** like *The Sun* still lead in overall reach—~23 million UK adults in FY 2024, plus the biggest YouTube channel for a UK newspaper.","start_idx":1437,"end_idx":1588,"safe_urls":[],"refs":[],"alt":"**National tabloids** like *The Sun* still lead in overall reach—~23 million UK adults in FY 2024, plus the biggest YouTube channel for a UK newspaper.","prompt_text":null,"type":"attribution","attributable_index":"1432-0","attributions":null,"attributions_debug":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn0news25","start_idx":1591,"end_idx":1609,"safe_urls":["https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/research-and-data/tv-radio-and-on-demand-research/tv-research/news/news-consumption-2024/news-consumption-in-the-uk-2024-report.pdf?v=379621&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/sep/10/internet-tv-uk-most-popular-news-source-first-time?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/14565117/the-sun-still-number-one-news-brand/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([www.ofcom.org.uk](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/research-and-data/tv-radio-and-on-demand-research/tv-research/news/news-consumption-2024/news-consumption-in-the-uk-2024-report.pdf?v=379621&utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"News consumption in the UK 2024 report","url":"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/research-and-data/tv-radio-and-on-demand-research/tv-research/news/news-consumption-2024/news-consumption-in-the-uk-2024-report.pdf?v=379621&utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1725900448,"snippet":"Sep 10, 2024 — 2 Social media is a significant component of online news consumption, with more than half of UK over-16s (52%) now using it as a news source.","attribution_segments":["1432-0"],"supporting_websites":[{"title":"The Sun is still shining as the number one news brand in the UK","url":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/14565117/the-sun-still-number-one-news-brand/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1743260574,"snippet":"THE Sun is still shining as the number one news brand in the UK despite a challenging market.

The Sun's coverage, including stories about Huw Edwards and the Royal family, continues to attract readers. Financially, News Group Newspapers (NGN) reduced its operating losses by 85% to £9.2 million. Furthermore, statutory losses, including legal costs, decreased by almost three-quarters to £18 million, supported by a Fox Corp indemnity. Legal costs fell significantly, contributing to reduced losses, and NGN's revenues dropped 2% to £296.3 million, primarily due to a decline in advertising revenue from social media firms.

A Reuters Institute survey across 50 countries found that 40% of respondents often or sometimes avoid the news, up from 29% in 2017, with figures in the U.S. and U.K. reaching 42% and 46%, respectively. People cite the negative impact on mood, excessive coverage of war and conflict, and a sense of helplessness as key reasons. Some have adopted selective news habits, such as weekly check-ins or avoiding video content, while others have cut it out completely to reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nPsychologists, like Roxane Cohen Silver, highlight the mental health effects of constant exposure to distressing events, especially via social media and graphic imagery. The article stresses the importance of setting boundaries and consuming news intentionally. While limiting exposure can be mentally healthy, experts caution that total disengagement may deepen social divides and reduce political participation, especially among young people, women, and lower socioeconomic groups. The trend reflects a broader debate on finding balance between staying informed and protecting mental well-being.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756724434,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/apr/01/outlets-seek-fresh-strategies-as-uk-poll-shows-news-avoidance-on-the-rise","title":"Outlets seek fresh strategies as UK poll shows 'news avoidance' on the rise","snippet":"With rising levels of \"news avoidance\" due to negativity, volume, and distrust, newsrooms globally are implementing innovative strategies, such as \"ethics boxes,\" to regain audience trust and interest. An Opinium poll revealed that regular TV news consumption has decreased to 47%, with radio and online news also seeing declines. Distrust, particularly among young people, and changes in social media and search platforms contribute to this trend.

But we can do things differently","snippet":"In 2024, there has been a noticeable increase in news avoidance, with almost 40% of people actively turning away from news due to its depressing, relentless, and often boring nature. This phenomenon is partly attributed to the overwhelming influx of news through constant notifications on digital devices. The news media's response has been to produce more content through various platforms, which has led to a flooded and noisy news environment. This has become increasingly dangerous as populist politicians and businessmen effectively bypass traditional media to spread disinformation, influencing elections and public opinion. Despite these challenges, solutions such as producing more relatable and understandable news, and leveraging entertaining news formats like podcasts and TV shows, are being implemented. It is crucial to fight for accurate, fact-based news, as it remains a key pillar of democracy, vital for holding power accountable and keeping the public informed.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1734775215,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2025","title":"Digital News Report 2025","snippet":"We find traditional news media struggling to connect with much of the public, with declining engagement, low trust, and stagnating digital subscriptions.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2024","title":"Digital News Report 2024","snippet":"This year's report reveals new findings about the consumption of online news globally.

Además, ha atacado directamente a periodistas, como ocurrió en una reciente confrontación viral con un reportero de ABC News.

A federal judge ruled Trump's executive order against the Perkins Coie law firm unconstitutional, favoring free speech and due process. The administration is also seeking Supreme Court permission to grant Elon Musk's “Department of Government Efficiency” (Doge) access to Social Security data, despite privacy concerns. Meanwhile, Trump plans to rename Veterans Day to honor World War I victory and host a military parade.

Trump's administration has escalated hostilities toward mainstream media, including a $20 billion lawsuit against CBS and attempts to shut down federally funded broadcasters like NPR and Voice of America. An executive order recently aimed to defund public broadcasters, accusing them of biased reporting. The RSF also highlighted the collapse of local journalism, worsened by economic pressures and the dominance of tech firms whose advertising revenue drains funding from traditional news sources. Additionally, cuts to USAID have harmed global independent journalism, especially in Eastern Europe.

On several structural measures (independent regulators, strong public-service broadcasting rules) it’s **better than** the US and many others.  \n- It’s **not** the best either. Trust is relatively low here compared with the Nordic high-trust cluster, and ownership concentration plus partisan tabloids do drag quality down.  \n- So the blanket claim “it’s all bullshit” doesn’t hold water; the more accurate take is “**mixed quality, strong institutions, weak trust**.”\n\n# The big picture (compare & contrast)\n\n**1) Trust in news: UK low–mid, not bottom**  \n- Global trust has flatlined at **40%**. The UK sits **around ~35%** and has fallen ~16 points since 2015—worse than the Nordics but better than the lowest-trust countries. Finland ~**67%**, Hungary/Greece **~22%**. citeturn1search1turn1search9turn2search14\n\n**2) Press freedom: UK scores “good/satisfactory,” well above the US**  \n- **RSF 2025:** UK ranks **20/180** (score 78.9). The US is **57/180** (“problematic”). That’s a clear structural advantage for the UK environment. citeturn1search0turn2search4\n\n**3) Public-service media: UK is unusually strong**  \n- BBC/ITV/C4 operate under **statutory impartiality** and are still among the **most trusted** news sources in the country, despite noisy criticism and slipping youth reach. Ofcom’s latest market reports still show BBC as the single most-watched TV/news brand (and heavy overall video share), with YouTube rising fast among under-35s. citeturn0search4turn0search7  \n- Globally, many national broadcasters are **more politicised** (US has no equivalent PSB with UK-style impartiality rules; several European state broadcasters face direct government pressure). The UK’s rules and regulator create real guardrails—even if individual outputs get flak. citeturn0search6\n\n**4) Ownership & pluralism: a UK weak spot**  \n- The UK press is **highly concentrated** and predominantly **right-leaning** in national print, which affects agenda-setting and tone (and helps explain the persistent “hostile media” feeling for Labour governments). Recent work again flags consolidation risks. citeturn0search15\n\n**5) News avoidance & mood: a global problem, not uniquely British**  \n- **News avoidance** keeps rising worldwide; the UK and US are both in the **low-mid-40s%** of people who often/sometimes avoid news. Drivers: negativity, volume, helplessness—then algorithmic feeds amplify the worst bits. This is not a uniquely UK “media rot”; it’s a **systemic, international** shift. citeturn0news75turn0search13\n\n**6) Social platforms now rival TV for agenda-setting**  \n- In the UK, online news reach now matches or exceeds TV; social feeds are central, especially for under-35s. That matters because **much of what goes viral is repackaged from mainstream outlets**—but with **emotionally charged framing**. The original reporting may be sober; the share-layer often isn’t.

The article stresses the importance of setting boundaries and consuming news intentionally.

Here’s a “thinking-mode” breakdown you can use for the **Broken Britain Briefing**:\n\n---\n\n## Why “Good” Journalism Struggles, and “Bad” News Wins\n\n### 1. **Structural Funding Decline**\n- **Collapse of print revenue:** Newspaper advertising, once the backbone of funding for reporting, has collapsed since the 2000s (classifieds lost to platforms like Rightmove, Craigslist, Indeed).  \n- **Digital ad money flows to platforms:** Google, Meta, TikTok capture the lion’s share of digital ad spend; UK publishers get scraps.  \n- **Local news hollowed out:** Over 300 local newspapers have closed since 2005; staffing has halved in some regions. This means fewer reporters per community, less scrutiny of councils and courts.  \n\n➡️ *Impact*: Fewer journalists with less time = reliance on press releases, wire copy, and “churnalism.”\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Newsroom Incentives**\n- **Pageviews and clicks**: Editors track traffic dashboards in real time. Reporters know “bad news” (crime, outrage, scandals, celebrity gaffes) drives more clicks than a nuanced policy explainer.  \n- **Metrics culture**: Journalists are under pressure to publish multiple stories a day. Long, investigative features are expensive and risky, with uncertain payoff.  \n- **SEO & trending**: Many stories are crafted to ride Google Trends or"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-68acbab14fe08191bfa946c0512151e3","request_id":"9792cb149a5eae4b-ZRH","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","finish_details":{"type":"interrupted","reason":"client_stopped"},"is_complete":true,"parent_id":"5c6d5713-7726-4685-908c-589b24ef1bc4","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5c6d5713-7726-4685-908c-589b24ef1bc4","children":[]},"04ff317b-b178-4f03-9d06-e1a5536fa051":{"id":"04ff317b-b178-4f03-9d06-e1a5536fa051","message":{"id":"04ff317b-b178-4f03-9d06-e1a5536fa051","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756876811.164738,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Right — this is the other half of the picture. If you want to understand (and explain) *why* so much UK news output looks shallow, sensational, or skewed, you have to dig into the **incentive structures** facing newsrooms. It’s not simply “journalists being lazy”; it’s how economics, technology, and editorial culture have lined up to reward “bad news” over “good news.” Here’s a thinking-mode breakdown:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Economic Pressure and the Hollowing Out of Newsrooms**\n- **Collapse of advertising model**: Local and national papers once relied on classifieds and display ads. Google and Facebook vacuumed up that revenue. UK local journalism has been particularly gutted — newsroom staffing has dropped by more than half since 2007, and many towns have no dedicated reporters at all.  \n- **Result**: fewer reporters covering more beats. Journalists don’t have time for 3-month deep dives when they’re filing 3–5 stories a day. “Churnalism” (copying PR or wire content) fills the gaps.  \n- This isn’t malice, it’s triage: survival mode in underfunded newsrooms.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Platform Metrics as Editors**\n- Editors once curated for public interest and prestige. Now, **audience analytics (click-throughs, dwell time, shares)** sit on giant dashboards in every newsroom.  \n- Stories that are **simple, emotional, conflict-framed** outperform nuanced policy explainers.  \n- A 2,000-word deep dive might change minds over time — but a sensational “shock horror” headline drives *immediate traffic*, which keeps the lights on.  \n- This is the “bad news bias”: negativity, outrage and scandal are *algorithmically advantaged*.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. **Paywalls and Shareability**\n- **Serious reporting is often locked up** (*FT*, *Times*, *Telegraph*) — reaching subscribers, not the mass public.  \n- **Free-to-read sources** (*Guardian*, *Independent*, *i*, *BBC*) dominate *sharing*. That means their stories get recirculated on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter — but often stripped of nuance and remixed into outrage-bait.  \n- Paradox: the most reliable stuff is least shareable; the most viral stuff is rarely the most careful.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Career and Cultural Incentives**\n- Journalists are **measured on output**: bylines per week, traffic spikes, social traction. Few are rewarded for “slow journalism.”  \n- Newsroom culture valorises the **scoop** (fast, first, clickable) more than the explainer (slow, comprehensive, accurate).  \n- The rise of freelance/precariat work exacerbates this: many young reporters are on short contracts or per-piece pay, so they chase quick hits to stay afloat.  \n- At the same time, the public *say* they want depth, but engagement metrics tell editors that long, careful pieces are “niche"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-68acbab14fe08191bfa946c0512151e3","request_id":"9792cbd08aebae4b-ZRH","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","finish_details":{"type":"interrupted","reason":"client_stopped"},"is_complete":true,"parent_id":"fa657695-badb-4d4d-b915-26e5bcb6fba8","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"fa657695-badb-4d4d-b915-26e5bcb6fba8","children":[]},"abab86aa-6f39-4918-9184-5fd47500cb5b":{"id":"abab86aa-6f39-4918-9184-5fd47500cb5b","message":{"id":"abab86aa-6f39-4918-9184-5fd47500cb5b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756876845.629378,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"search_query\": [{\"q\": \"Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2025 UK trust news avoidance data\"}, {\"q\": \"Ofcom News Consumption in the UK 2024 report PDF share of people using TV online social media for news\"}, {\"q\": \"Cairncross Review 2019 report UK journalism sustainability recommendations churnalism press releases\"}, {\"q\": \"Nick Davies Flat Earth News churnalism percentage of PR content study\"}, {\"q\": \"CMA online platforms and digital advertising market study 2020 UK share of Google and Facebook in digital advertising\"}], \"response_length\": \"short\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","search_queries":[{"type":"search","q":"Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2025 UK trust news avoidance data"},{"type":"search","q":"Ofcom News Consumption in the UK 2024 report PDF share of people using TV online social media for news"},{"type":"search","q":"Cairncross Review 2019 report UK journalism sustainability recommendations churnalism press releases"},{"type":"search","q":"Nick Davies Flat Earth News churnalism percentage of PR content study"},{"type":"search","q":"CMA online platforms and digital advertising market study 2020 UK share of Google and Facebook in digital advertising"}],"search_display_string":"Searching the web...","searched_display_string":"Searched the web...","reasoning_title":"Conducting deep analysis of UK newsroom economics and trends","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"9792cc8a0a24ae4b-ZRH","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"00a851ba-e5d0-405c-b3c7-e767f4a912d0","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"web.run","channel":null},"parent":"00a851ba-e5d0-405c-b3c7-e767f4a912d0","children":["a0d544b8-c104-40e9-b112-3eb14146d64c"]},"a0d544b8-c104-40e9-b112-3eb14146d64c":{"id":"a0d544b8-c104-40e9-b112-3eb14146d64c","message":{"id":"a0d544b8-c104-40e9-b112-3eb14146d64c","author":{"role":"tool","name":"web.run","metadata":{"real_author":"tool:web.run"}},"create_time":1756876871.1266348,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.theguardian.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/sep/01/news-avoidance-high-anxiety","title":"Why more and more people are tuning the news out: 'Now I don't have that anxiety'","snippet":"An increasing number of people globally are choosing to tune out from the news due to its overwhelming volume, emotional toll, and growing distrust in media. A Reuters Institute survey across 50 countries found that 40% of respondents often or sometimes avoid the news, up from 29% in 2017, with figures in the U.S. and U.K. reaching 42% and 46%, respectively. People cite the negative impact on mood, excessive coverage of war and conflict, and a sense of helplessness as key reasons. Some have adopted selective news habits, such as weekly check-ins or avoiding video content, while others have cut it out completely to reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nPsychologists, like Roxane Cohen Silver, highlight the mental health effects of constant exposure to distressing events, especially via social media and graphic imagery. The article stresses the importance of setting boundaries and consuming news intentionally. While limiting exposure can be mentally healthy, experts caution that total disengagement may deepen social divides and reduce political participation, especially among young people, women, and lower socioeconomic groups. The trend reflects a broader debate on finding balance between staying informed and protecting mental well-being.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1756724434,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/apr/01/i-cant-cope-with-it-any-more-newsrooms-scramble-to-retain-audiences-amid-the-big-switch-off","title":"'I can't cope with it any more': newsrooms scramble to retain audiences amid the big switch-off","snippet":"Deborah Turness of BBC News is spearheading efforts to tackle the rising trend of news avoidance, exemplified by individuals like Dave Ayres who limit news consumption due to its negative impact on their mental health. This sentiment is echoed by other former news enthusiasts and Caroline Waterston of the Daily Mirror, who is particularly concerned with attracting the under-35 demographic. Strategies to combat this include increased curation and personalisation of news content to retain audiences, with companies experimenting with tailored newsletters and podcasts. However, personalisation must balance personal interest to avoid creating echo chambers. Additionally, the \"constructive journalism\" movement is gaining traction, promoting positive and problem-solving stories to counteract negativity and feelings of powerlessness among news avoiders. To engage younger audiences, newsrooms are focusing on transparency and leveraging new media formats and influencer-like journalists to connect more effectively.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1743490812,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2025","title":"Digital News Report 2025","snippet":"We find traditional news media struggling to connect with much of the public, with declining engagement, low trust, and stagnating digital subscriptions.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":null,"attribution":"reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2025-06/Digital_News-Report_2025.pdf","title":"Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2025","snippet":"While overall trust in the news has remained stable for the third year in a ...

This signals a fundamental change in news consumption since TV overtook radio in the 1960s. However, the BBC still dominates across all media platforms—radio, TV, and even online content traced back through social networks. Regardless of political allegiance, voters from Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Reform UK, and Green parties all heavily rely on the BBC for news. Notably, this indicates the BBC’s critical role in shaping political discourse and elections in the UK. Future considerations include potential mutualisation of the BBC and the large capital spending gap in healthcare infrastructure. Political strategies continue to evolve, with Labour’s Keir Starmer engaging New Labour era figures and balancing relations between unions and businesses.

Reach has struggled with declining print sales, leading to more \"clickbait\" accusations. Despite experiments, Reach found that free news works best for their readers, although it leaves the company susceptible to economic challenges. Furthermore, changes in Google and Facebook algorithms have reduced their web traffic, while competition with the BBC remains an issue. This has contributed to financial struggles, including job cuts and a dip in share prices, although there was a brief recovery in recent performance. Some employees feel pressured by online page-view targets, while Mullen defends their publishing model, citing affordability and reader preferences for lighter news stories.

Reach's annual pre-tax profits dropped 45% to £36.7 million, while revenue fell by over 5% to £568.6 million. Despite the financial setbacks, shares rose by over 10% after resolving longstanding financial issues related to phone-hacking claims and pension commitments. The decline in digital page views has led to job cuts, with Reach reducing about 450 positions last year. Moving forward, Reach plans to continue providing free content rather than introducing paywalls, despite the changing landscape of social media traffic and the advertising market.

As a result, organic traffic to news websites fell from over 2.3 billion visits in mid-2024 to under 1.7 billion in May 2025. The share of news-related searches ending in zero-clicks surged from 56% to 69% within a year. Traditional SEO strategies are proving less effective, and many large news domains are experiencing notable traffic declines. Meanwhile, ChatGPT referrals to news sites saw a significant rise, growing from under 1 million in early 2024 to over 25 million in 2025, with outlets like Reuters and the New York Post benefitting. However, this growth hasn’t fully offset the losses from reduced Google referrals. In response, Google has introduced the Offerwall tool for alternative monetization, as media organizations seek new revenue strategies amid job losses. The shift reflects broader changes in how users engage with news, gravitating toward direct, AI-generated summaries and issue-driven inquiries, signaling transformative trends in digital news consumption.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1751582393,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.reuters.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-says-will-no-longer-pay-traditional-news-content-australia-france-germany-2024-03-01/","title":"Facebook owner Meta angers Australia with plan to stop paying for news content","snippet":"Meta Platforms announced it will stop compensating Australian news publishers for content appearing on Facebook, provoking conflict with Australian government over its 2021 law requiring internet giants to forge licensing deals with news publishers. Meta will also remove a news tab feature in Australia and the United States, having already done so in the UK, France, and Germany. The Australian government criticizes this move, arguing it undermines local journalism and is unfair exploitation of others' investments. The government is seeking advice from relevant authorities on proceeding steps, as the legislation could enforce penalties on Meta. Despite this, Meta continues to allow news content posts without obligation to pay publishers, with similar actions seen in Canada following comparable laws.

However, the bill only replicates provisions from the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 without addressing its flaws, such as the subjective inquiry into the claimant's intent and a narrow definition of public interest. The UK Anti-Slapp Coalition proposes more effective measures including early dismissal mechanisms, minimal costs for defendants, and exemplary damages for egregious cases.

However, regulatory oversight in business continues to intensify. The UK's Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 mandates businesses to self-monitor for fraud, set to take effect next September. This law also broadens corporate liability for crimes, potentially increasing penalties. Nick Ephgrave, appointed director of the Serious Fraud Office, emphasizes aggressive tactics and swift investigations to combat fraud, leveraging the 2023 legislation. Additionally, new tax regulations under the Finance Act 2024, and legal debates on dishonesty tests in criminal law, further complicate the corporate landscape. Moreover, the pending Supreme Court appeals by Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo in the Libor and Euribor manipulation cases reflect ongoing legal entanglements for businesses. While strong regulations are necessary, their cumulative effect may criminalize lawful business operations, challenging companies to adopt effective anti-fraud measures to navigate this complex regulatory environment.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1733961660,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anti-slapp-law-may-be-watered-down-by-vested-interests-mps-warn-rfk8l87pj","title":"Anti-Slapp law may be watered down by vested interests, MPs warn","snippet":"Legislation to curtail the use of \"strategic litigation against public participation\" (Slapps) is in jeopardy due to pressure from law firms with vested interests, according to MPs. The draft bill, backed by the government, aims to allow judges to dismiss such cases early, preventing wealthy individuals from using lawsuits to silence critics such as journalists. Former Labour minister Wayne David proposed amendments to broaden the criteria for early dismissal, aiming to protect free speech further. However, there is resistance from claimant law firms and concerns among government sources about giving judges excessive power. Media stakeholders and legal experts have voiced that the current bill is too narrow and could be ineffective. The Ministry of Justice is considering these concerns, but without government backing, amendments are unlikely to succeed. Critics warn that the bill may undermine legitimate claims and complicate legal processes.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1713456000,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b79e5ba0bc800bb22261c498af8124","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching UK SLAPP reforms, defamation costs, and more","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"9792cc8a0a24ae4b-ZRH","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"88ecb5a0-eb53-4675-b0c2-3e8a520dd3c6","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"88ecb5a0-eb53-4675-b0c2-3e8a520dd3c6","children":["77cd78a2-95ee-4ec4-91b4-e002e2aa02ef"]},"77cd78a2-95ee-4ec4-91b4-e002e2aa02ef":{"id":"77cd78a2-95ee-4ec4-91b4-e002e2aa02ef","message":{"id":"77cd78a2-95ee-4ec4-91b4-e002e2aa02ef","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756876901.835786,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Investigating newsroom pay and freelancing rates","content":"I should find data about newsroom pay, precarious work, and freelancing rates.

Mullen acknowledges the declining state of traditional newspapers like the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express, which have turned to ad-heavy online content. Reach has struggled with declining print sales, leading to more \"clickbait\" accusations. Despite experiments, Reach found that free news works best for their readers, although it leaves the company susceptible to economic challenges. Furthermore, changes in Google and Facebook algorithms have reduced their web traffic, while competition with the BBC remains an issue. This has contributed to financial struggles, including job cuts and a dip in share prices, although there was a brief recovery in recent performance. Some employees feel pressured by online page-view targets, while Mullen defends their publishing model, citing affordability and reader preferences for lighter news stories. He envisions a change in business pressure once the pension deficit is resolved in 2028.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1738454460,"attribution":"www.thetimes.co.uk"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b79e5ba0bc800bb22261c498af8124","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for UK journalist pay and newsroom conditions","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"9792cc8a0a24ae4b-ZRH","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"b6170dea-1bf5-4183-b5fc-62169bb05ba5","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"b6170dea-1bf5-4183-b5fc-62169bb05ba5","children":["7c72e92c-8fe6-4109-81e1-9150a0ad9648"]},"7c72e92c-8fe6-4109-81e1-9150a0ad9648":{"id":"7c72e92c-8fe6-4109-81e1-9150a0ad9648","message":{"id":"7c72e92c-8fe6-4109-81e1-9150a0ad9648","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756876906.892107,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Exploring the rise of churnalism in journalism","content":"I should look into reasons why journalists trend toward churnalism: including output targets, SEO, the constant news cycle, lack of time for legal review, deskilling, high costs of FOI and investigations, and mass PR content.

This bias causes us to focus more on negative aspects, which can affect our relationships, decision-making, and perception of others. Evolutionarily, this was a survival mechanism, but it now often leads to dwelling on negative experiences more than positive ones. Research shows that the brain responds more intensely to negative stimuli. To combat this, strategies include stopping negative self-talk, reframing situations positively, establishing new, uplifting patterns, and savoring positive moments.

The media's tendency to focus on negative stories, such as crime or economic issues, skews public perception, often making people believe that situations are worse than they are. There is evidence that, despite actual economic improvements, media coverage has grown more pessimistic. This can be particularly seen in the reporting of petrol prices, which tend to be highlighted more when they rise. This has led to a biased view of the national economy, irrespective of individuals' relatively stable personal financial situations. Subscriptions-based cable news channels, especially rightwing ones like Fox News, exacerbate this negativity bias to keep viewers engaged. Such media influence complicates efforts for balanced public understanding and political gains, illustrated by the lack of public acknowledgment of ongoing economic expansions under President Biden.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1715313636.429,"attribution":"www.ft.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b79e5ba0bc800bb22261c498af8124","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching studies on negativity bias and news engagement","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"9792cc8a0a24ae4b-ZRH","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"e901534b-9ebb-49e2-91f2-561b6b58fb1d","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e901534b-9ebb-49e2-91f2-561b6b58fb1d","children":["81fdfc72-768a-4a34-a915-2ff31f50a0ad"]},"81fdfc72-768a-4a34-a915-2ff31f50a0ad":{"id":"81fdfc72-768a-4a34-a915-2ff31f50a0ad","message":{"id":"81fdfc72-768a-4a34-a915-2ff31f50a0ad","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1756876921.620947,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Considering FOI issues","content":"I want to include information on the challenges around FOI requests in the UK, specifically regarding delays and the Cabinet Office Clearing House from 2021.

Here’s a straight-talk “why the system produces churnalism” map—UK-specific, but with global forces that squeeze almost every newsroom.\n\n# TL;DR\nDeep, original reporting is **time-intensive, risky, and hard to monetise**. The business model rewards **volume, speed, and emotional click-through**. Fewer journalists, more PR, and platform gatekeepers mean the path of least resistance often wins.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Money: the ad market flipped—and publishers lost power\n- **Platforms ate the ad pie**. The UK competition regulator found Google and Meta hold dominant shares of search and display ad markets—leaving publishers with scraps and weak bargaining power. Result: fewer staff, more output targets, thinner reporting. citeturn0search9turn0search4  \n- **Platform referrals collapsed**. Facebook’s pivot away from news cut publisher referrals by ~**48% in 2023**, with X/Twitter also down; UK groups (e.g., Reach) explicitly tie revenue falls and job cuts to these shifts. That pushes editors toward whatever still brings traffic now (commodity rewrites, SEO hits). citeturn2search0turn2search2turn2news20  \n- **Search volatility + zero-click**. Recent Google updates (2024–25) and AI summaries increase “read here, don’t click” answers—again shrinking upside for slow investigations. citeturn2search15turn2news21\n\n## 2) Fewer reporters, more quotas, more “live” formats\n- The UK’s largest commercial publisher **keeps cutting and reshaping** newsrooms; managers push higher story counts to claw back page views. That’s a structural nudge toward quick rewrites and liveblogs, not weeks of digging. citeturn1search15turn6search7turn1search6  \n- UK journalists themselves report **longer hours, less time per story**, and rising profit pressures—exactly the conditions that breed “churn.” (Reuters Institute survey of UK journalists.) citeturn4search2\n\n## 3) PR tsunami vs. shrinking newsrooms\n- The UK has **more PRs than journalists** (ONS-linked counts put PRs roughly 9–14k ahead). Newsrooms drowning in pitches + fewer staff = more copy that starts life as a release. citeturn1search2turn1search5  \n- Classic UK studies show a **big share of press content** originates in PR and wire copy; agency text often passes through with minimal reporting. This is *the* empirical backbone of “churnalism.” citeturn4search3turn7search0\n\n## 4) Metrics, headlines, and the attention economy\n- **Negative words lift clicks**. Large-scale experiments find each extra negative word in a headline raises click-through ~**2–3%**. When the dashboard (Chartbeat/Parse.ly) runs the day, editors learn fast. citeturn8search0  \n- Negative stories also **spread more on social** than positive ones, so emotion-laden, short-cycle content beats nuanced, slow pieces in distribution. citeturn8search3  \n- Result: “good” (public-interest) news is **expensive, slow, legally thorny, modestly read**; “bad” (fast, affective) news is **cheap and shareable**. The incentives are obvious.\n\n## 5) Legal and access friction raise the cost of real reporting\n- **SLAPP risk & libel costs**: even with new anti-SLAPP provisions (narrow, economic-crime scope), UK litigation remains a chilling, expensive threat. Many investigations die in legal review. citeturn5search0turn5search18  \n- **FOI obstacles**: years of complaints about the Cabinet Office “Clearing House,” slower responses, enforcement actions and backlogs—all of which **push journalists toward easier sources** than months-long FOI battles. citeturn9search0turn9search10turn9search11\n\n## 6) Audiences moved; PSBs can’t offset it alone\n- UK audiences now get news **online as much as on TV**; social media is used by **~52%** for news. The BBC/ITV/C4 remain highly used and trusted—but they can’t carry commercial investigative capacity for everyone else. citeturn0search1  \n- **News avoidance** is rising (UK c. mid-40s%). That pushes commissioners toward packaging that can still break through—again favouring high-arousal, low-friction stories. citeturn0news50\n\n## 7) Labour market precarity narrows who can do deep work\n- Many UK freelances report **median journalism income ~£17.5k**, below a full-time minimum-wage equivalent. That means less time to FOI, verify, and lawyer a piece—more need to file fast. citeturn6search4turn6search6\n\n---\n\n## So… why don’t “they” just do better?\nBecause the **dominant system rewards the opposite behaviours**:\n- **Revenue**: programmatic CPMs and platform volatility mean page views *today* keep the lights on; a three-week investigation often doesn’t. citeturn0search9turn2search0  \n- **Distribution**: platforms amplify **short, emotional, negative** content; in practice, that dictates newsroom bets. citeturn8search0turn2search2  \n- **Capacity**: fewer reporters + centralised hubs = **higher story quotas, thinner shoe-leather**. citeturn6search7  \n- **Risk**: legal exposure + FOI drag = **high fixed costs** per proper investigation. citeturn5search18turn9search0\n\nThis doesn’t absolve weak journalism—but it explains why even good people end up shipping **fast, iterative, low-originality** stories.\n\n---\n\n## What changes the incentives (pragmatically)?\n- **Platform reality**: plan as if social referrals keep shrinking; shift toward direct relationships (email, apps, member communities). (That’s where many UK outlets are heading.) citeturn2search14  \n- **Policy levers**: fully-fledged anti-SLAPP (beyond economic crime); FOI performance enforcement; targeted public-interest journalism funds (Cairncross-style). citeturn0search7turn0search12  \n- **Business model**: fewer commodity posts, more *must-read* beats that earn **subscriptions or philanthropy**; accept lower volume, higher value. (Plenty of evidence that volume-churn is a Red Queen’s race.) citeturn0search15  \n- **Editorial**: commission for **impact over clicks**; measure **saves, dwell, return reads**; pilot constructive/solutions formats where appropriate (mixed evidence, but promising in niches). citeturn8search10\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a one-page graphic for your Briefing: “**Seven Levers That Produce Churn**,” with UK references on each lever.\n\nnavlistRecent coverage: UK media pressures and shiftsturn0news52,turn2news20,turn0news51,turn1news30,turn9news20"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"content_references":[{"matched_text":"citeturn0search9turn0search4","start_idx":727,"end_idx":759,"safe_urls":["https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efc57ed3a6f4023d242ed56/Final_report_1_July_2020_.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([GOV.UK](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efc57ed3a6f4023d242ed56/Final_report_1_July_2020_.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Online platforms and digital advertising","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efc57ed3a6f4023d242ed56/Final_report_1_July_2020_.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1593617176,"snippet":"Jul 1, 2020 — 341 Para 6.117 CMA Online platforms and digital advertising: Market study interim report. ... 5.3 However, Google and Facebook's collective share ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":9}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"GOV.UK"},{"title":"Online platforms and digital advertising market study","url":"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1562148054,"snippet":"Jul 3, 2019 — The Competition and Markets Authority has completed its market study into online platforms and the digital advertising market in the UK.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":4}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"GOV.UK"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn2search0turn2search2turn2news20","start_idx":1077,"end_idx":1121,"safe_urls":["https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2024/dnr-executive-summary?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/journalism-media-and-technology-trends-and-predictions-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ft.com/content/93efa90e-128c-4885-a7b8-4d0ea5f17d52?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Reuters Institute](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2024/dnr-executive-summary?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/93efa90e-128c-4885-a7b8-4d0ea5f17d52?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Overview and key findings of the 2024 Digital News Report","url":"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2024/dnr-executive-summary?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Jun 17, 2024 — Industry data show that the combined effect of these changes was to reduce traffic referrals from Facebook to publishers by 48% last year and ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[{"title":"Journalism, media, and technology trends and predictions ...","url":"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/journalism-media-and-technology-trends-and-predictions-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":null,"snippet":"Jan 9, 2024 — Aggregate Facebook traffic to news and media properties has declined by 48%, with traffic from X down 27% and Instagram by 10%.

As a result, organic traffic to news websites fell from over 2.3 billion visits in mid-2024 to under 1.7 billion in May 2025. The share of news-related searches ending in zero-clicks surged from 56% to 69% within a year. Traditional SEO strategies are proving less effective, and many large news domains are experiencing notable traffic declines. Meanwhile, ChatGPT referrals to news sites saw a significant rise, growing from under 1 million in early 2024 to over 25 million in 2025, with outlets like Reuters and the New York Post benefitting. However, this growth hasn’t fully offset the losses from reduced Google referrals. In response, Google has introduced the Offerwall tool for alternative monetization, as media organizations seek new revenue strategies amid job losses. The shift reflects broader changes in how users engage with news, gravitating toward direct, AI-generated summaries and issue-driven inquiries, signaling transformative trends in digital news consumption.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":21}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"New York Post"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn1search15turn6search7turn1search6","start_idx":1618,"end_idx":1664,"safe_urls":["https://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2024/news/reach-bosses-in-drive-to-increase-journalists-story-volumes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2025/news/reach-staff-braced-for-job-cuts-as-huge-editorial-shake-up-looms/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/nov/08/reach-mirror-express-newspapers-publisher-cut-jobs?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/nov/08/reach-mirror-express-newspapers-publisher-cut-jobs?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [HoldtheFrontPage](https://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2024/news/reach-bosses-in-drive-to-increase-journalists-story-volumes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Mirror and Express owner to cut about 450 jobs - 10% of workforce","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/nov/08/reach-mirror-express-newspapers-publisher-cut-jobs?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1699470887,"snippet":"The publisher Reach, owner of newspapers including the Mirror, Express, and Star, announced plans to cut around 450 jobs, representing almost 10% of its workforce, as part of efforts to reduce operating costs by 5-6% in 2024.

The article stresses the importance of setting boundaries and consuming news intentionally.

Obviously you can’t reduce a multi-year, multi-actor process to precise maths, but assigning **illustrative percentages** can help readers see where responsibility lies. I’ll sketch it as a rough apportionment across **key ministers, parties, and phases** in the Online Safety Act (OSA) timeline.\n\n---\n\n# **Accountability Breakdown: Who Drove the Online Safety Act?**\n\n### **Conservative Government (2017–2023): ~70% of responsibility**\nThe OSA was conceived, drafted, and pushed through under the Conservatives.\n\n- **Theresa May (PM, 2016–2019)** – *10%*  \n  - Launched the **2017 Digital Economy Act** (failed porn AV scheme) and commissioned the **2019 Online Harms White Paper**, the root of the OSA.  \n\n- **Oliver Dowden (DCMS Sec., 2020–2021)** – *5%*  \n  - Oversaw the policy in its preparatory phase, but reportedly urged delay (“kick it into the long grass”). Responsibility more for inaction than action.  \n\n- **Nadine Dorries (DCMS Sec., 2021–2022)** – *25%*  \n  - **Introduced the Bill in March 2022**.  \n  - Championed child-safety framing, added “priority illegal offences” (revenge porn, suicide facilitation, hate crime).  \n  - Pushed to accelerate despite Cabinet resistance.  \n\n- **Chris Philp (Digital Minister, 2021–2022)** – *10%*  \n  - Expanded the Bill to cover **commercial porn sites** (not just social media).  \n\n- **Rishi Sunak (PM from Oct 2022)** – *10%*  \n  - Kept the Bill alive through political turmoil.  \n  - Accepted dropping “legal but harmful” duties under pressure (seen as watering down).  \n  - Announced September 2023 clarification on encryption powers (they wouldn’t be enforced until “technically feasible”).  \n\n- **Michelle Donelan (Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, 2022–2023)** – *7%*  \n  - **Formally introduced the Online Safety Bill in the Commons in 2023**.  \n  - Steered it to Royal Assent in **Oct 2023**.  \n\n- **Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay (DCMS/Lords minister)** – *3%*  \n  - Managed the Bill’s passage through the House of Lords.  \n\n### **Labour (Opposition 2019–2024; Government from Jul 2024): ~20%**\nLabour could have opposed more strongly, or amended more radically. Instead, they chose to support and later accelerate.\n\n- **Labour Front Bench (esp. Lucy Powell, Shadow DCMS; later Peter Kyle as Sec of State)** – *15%*  \n  - In opposition: **explicitly backed the principle of the Bill**, arguing “Labour supports the principles” (Hansard, Sept 2023).  \n  - Claimed credit for securing some amendments (e.g. journalist protections, transparency).  \n  - In government (2024–25): prioritised **fast-track implementation**, laying Ofcom codes (Dec 2024, Apr 2025) and pushing “safety by design.”  \n\n- **Keir Starmer (Leader of Opposition → PM from Jul 2024)** – *5%*  \n  - Approved manifesto commitment to “**build on the OSA** and implement swiftly.”  \n  - As PM, chose not to reopen or repeal, despite critiques—signalling political ownership.  \n\n### **Cross-Party Parliamentarians & Committees: ~5%**\n- MPs/Lords across parties scrutinised, but the **bill passed with broad cross-party support**.  \n- Select committees and backbench MPs influenced specific changes (e.g., removal of “legal but harmful” clause, tweaks on journalist protections).  \n- Their collective role was to **legitimize** the Bill and smooth passage, rather than drive its core agenda.  \n\n### **Civil Society & Advocacy Pressure: ~5%**\n- **Baroness Beeban Kidron** and the **5Rights Foundation** campaigned for children’s online protections.  \n- Bereaved parents (e.g. **Molly Russell’s family**) gave powerful testimony, shaping the child-safety focus.  \n- These voices didn’t draft legislation, but **made delay politically impossible**.  \n\n---\n\n# **Illustrative Responsibility Table**\n\n| Actor / Group                                | Approx.

Scotland and Northern Ireland later passed their own laws.  \n- So the *existence* of a revenge-porn law pre-dated the Online Safety Bill/Act.\n\n### What the OSA did  \n- In 2022, under **Nadine Dorries** as DCMS Secretary, the government announced it would **add “priority illegal content” offences** into the Bill, including:  \n  - **revenge pornography**,  \n  - **extreme pornography**,  \n  - **encouraging or assisting suicide**,  \n  - **fraud** and certain hate crimes.  \n  (This was explicitly flagged as a strengthening of the draft Bill.)citeturn2search4  \n\n- The **Online Safety Act 2023** doesn’t create the revenge-porn offence (that was 2015), but it **elevates it into the OSA’s regulatory framework**:  \n  - Platforms in scope have a **legal duty to proactively prevent users from being exposed to priority illegal content** like revenge porn, not just to remove it after a report.  \n  - Ofcom can fine companies up to 10% of global turnover if they don’t have effective systems to block such material.  \n\n### Bottom line  \n- **Revenge porn was already criminal** before the OSA.  \n- What the OSA did was **upgrade its status to “priority illegal” content**, forcing platforms to build proactive systems to stop it spreading (not just react if a victim complains).  \n\nThis fits the broader pattern of the OSA: taking *existing criminal offences* (child abuse imagery, terrorism, hate speech, revenge porn, fraud) and embedding them into a **new regulatory duty of care** for online platforms.  \n\nWould you like me to create a **“What the OSA actually added vs what already existed” table** for your sub-report?

Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly took her life after viewing harmful content online, echoed these concerns, suggesting the rules allow loopholes and criticizing government priorities. The Molly Rose Foundation also expressed skepticism, warning that the rules may not effect substantial change due to leniencies in content recommendation guidelines. Ofcom defended its measures as ambitious and potentially transformative, emphasizing enforcement powers that include large fines and possible service bans. The NSPCC and the Center for Countering Digital Hate welcomed the regulations but urged stronger safeguards, particularly against encrypted messaging.

Despite the introduction of codes of practice and guidelines, many of the largest platforms have yet to implement all necessary safety measures. All relevant sites and apps, including popular platforms like Facebook and Google, have until mid-March to begin risk assessments and implement appropriate measures. These measures include nominating senior executives for accountability, maintaining adequately staffed moderation teams, testing algorithms dealing with harmful content, and implementing tools for user complaints. Major issues like child sexual abuse material, terrorism, and fraud are prioritized, with the potential for substantial fines or site closures for non-compliance. Although the legislation marks a significant policy shift, child safety advocates argue that it doesn't sufficiently address certain harmful content like self-harm and suicide.

The new requirements, mandated under the Online Safety Act passed in 2023, will go into effect on July 25 and require online platforms to block under-18s from accessing harmful content like pornography, self-harm material, and content related to suicide unless they implement effective age verification. Despite these changes, critics—including bereaved parents like Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly died after being exposed to harmful online material—argue that Ofcom is not being forceful enough in its enforcement. Russell urged Dawes to exert more pressure on the government to tighten regulations surrounding social media and harmful content. Concerns have also been raised over the Online Safety Act's effectiveness, particularly its failure to address misinformation. A recent parliamentary report highlighted how social media helped spread misinformation during unrest in Southport. While Dawes said Ofcom is prepared to expand its remit if directed by Parliament, she declined to call for additional powers. She also criticized the BBC for its slow handling of a recent controversy, warning it risks losing public trust.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1752403433,"attribution":"www.theguardian.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-economy-bill-part-3-online-pornography","title":"Digital Economy Bill Part 3: Online Pornography","snippet":"Jul 5, 2016 — Part 3 of the Digital Economy Act introduces the requirement for commercial providers of online pornography to have robust age verification ...","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1467727380,"attribution":"www.gov.uk"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"www.legislation.gov.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/30/part/3/enacted","title":"Digital Economy Act 2017","snippet":"PART 3Online pornography. 14Internet pornography: requirement to prevent access by persons under 18.

Despite intentions to shield children from inappropriate content, the plan faced numerous delays and significant issues in implementation. Enforcement was postponed from its initial April 2018 date to mid-2019 and eventually not pursued. Instead, the UK government decided to address online harms through a different regulatory regime.\n\nKey challenges included notifying the European Commission, defining punishments, and managing the logistics of monitoring millions of websites. Critics raised concerns about porn providers’ compliance and users’ privacy and data security with age-checking technologies.

The BBFC, the regulatory body assigned to enforce the law, also found out about the cancellation through the media. The plan faced several controversies, including concerns over data privacy and effective implementation. Critics argued that age-verification could lead to sensitive user data being mishandled or hacked.

Websites hosting user-generated content would have a new \"duty of care\" to protect users, especially children, from such content, facing fines and possibly criminal prosecution for non-compliance. Critics suggest the regulation's scope is too wide and will likely be softened, focusing mainly on social networks and minimizing the regulatory burden on smaller businesses. While Ofcom would manage compliance and issue codes of practice, individual cases will not be its focus.

Defence Secretary John Healey denied these claims, stating the decommissioned equipment was obsolete or economically unrepairable. Additionally, Labour's Diane Abbott and Conservative Sir Edward Leigh jointly urged MPs to reject the assisted dying bill due to insufficient scrutiny and risks to vulnerable people.\n\nAngela Rayner stood in for PM Keir Starmer at PMQs, facing Alex Burghart, who criticized Labour's economic policies and inheritance tax changes affecting farmers. Rayner defended the changes, emphasizing support and investment in farming, while accusing Conservatives of scaremongering. Elsewhere, senior MPs criticized unhelpful commentary and misinformation following the Southport attacks, stressing the importance of fair reporting during criminal investigations.\n\nIn other developments, Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will complete his duties by January 6 after resigning over insufficient action on abuse cases, and the Conservative party finalized its shadow frontbench, now half comprising its MPs.

Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary, emphasized the government's commitment to a safer online environment and acknowledged the need for further action. Bereaved parents, like Ian Russell, whose daughter took her life after exposure to harmful content online, are pushing for stronger legislation. The charities argue that current draft rules do not sufficiently protect children and call for more stringent measures on live streaming, notifications, infinite scrolling, and age verification.

Peter Kyle, representing the Labour Government, argues that repealing the Act—as Nigel Farage of Reform UK has proposed—would endanger women and children by allowing violent, misogynistic, and predatory content to flourish online. Kyle emphasizes the Act’s critical role in cracking down on cyber-flashing, revenge porn, and content encouraging self-harm or suicide. He notes that police forces, including the MET with their V100 programme, rely on these legal tools to effectively combat male violence against women and children. The Labour Government defends the Act’s safeguarding impact and claims it does not infringe on legal adult content or free speech, which it mentions 50 times.\n\nIn contrast, Zia Yusuf of Reform UK criticizes the Act as a severe infringement on freedom of expression, arguing it results in political censorship and overblocking by social media platforms afraid of legal liability. Yusuf accuses the government of misusing the law for ideological suppression and promises that under Nigel Farage, Reform UK would repeal the Act to implement genuinely protective and freedom-compatible legislation.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1755383400,"attribution":"www.thesun.co.uk"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b79e5ba0bc800bb22261c498af8124","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching party manifestos for online safety commitments","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97a2992f0b280cc1-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"3679d86b-51e5-429f-a278-c0047de65fa0","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3679d86b-51e5-429f-a278-c0047de65fa0","children":["1a67621c-c1cc-49c0-a0a1-9231a2b07669"]},"1a67621c-c1cc-49c0-a0a1-9231a2b07669":{"id":"1a67621c-c1cc-49c0-a0a1-9231a2b07669","message":{"id":"1a67621c-c1cc-49c0-a0a1-9231a2b07669","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757042580.501625,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Allocating accountability in phases","content":"I have enough sources to set up a refined accountability matrix.

While users must now prove they are over 18 to access adult or potentially harmful content, the law also threatens end-to-end encryption, a fundamental layer of online privacy. Section 122, dubbed the \"spy clause,\" originally proposed client-side scanning of encrypted messages to detect illegal content, such as child abuse or terrorism-related material. Amid backlash from tech companies like WhatsApp and Signal, the UK temporarily paused this provision, stating implementation would resume when \"technically feasible.\" \n\nExperts warn that either scanning messages before encryption or inserting surveillance switches into devices would compromise users' privacy and security, effectively enabling mass surveillance. Critics argue this undermines the integrity of encryption, increases the risk of cyberattacks, and sets dangerous precedents. Meanwhile, parallel efforts in the EU, such as \"Chat Control,\" and amendments to the UK's Investigatory Powers Act, further extend government oversight. These changes compel tech firms to seek approval for security upgrades and remove features upon request without notifying users. Overall, the Act marks a broader erosion of digital rights under the guise of online safety.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1755102725,"attribution":"www.techradar.com"}]},{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"questions-statements.parliament.uk","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-11-29/hcws397","title":"Online Safety Bill - Written questions, answers and statements","snippet":"Statement made on 29 November 2022.

Admits Defeat in Controversial Fight to Break Encryption","snippet":"In a significant development, the British government has conceded to not enforcing a controversial clause in the UK's Online Safety Bill that would have undermined end-to-end encryption. This decision follows the government's acknowledgment that technology capable of securely scanning encrypted messages for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) without compromising user privacy does not yet exist. The clause had faced substantial opposition, with messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Signal threatening to withdraw from the UK if the bill passed. Privacy activists and tech companies have hailed the concession as a victory, though the bill still retains these controversial provisions. Critics argue that such measures pave the way for wider government surveillance in the future. Despite the concession, the government maintains that its position on tackling online child sexual abuse has not changed. The implications of this decision are expected to influence global discussions on encryption and privacy, particularly in the European Union where similar debates are ongoing.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1694012340,"attribution":"www.wired.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/the-uks-controversial-online-safety-act-is-now-law","title":"The UK's Controversial Online Safety Act Is Now Law","snippet":"The UK’s Online Safety Act, now law, aims to regulate internet content by enforcing platforms to address illegal and harmful material, focusing particularly on child safety. Initially envisioned in 2019, the bill has evolved and expanded over the years, finding broad political consensus for the need to protect users, especially children, from harmful online content like healthcare disinformation, posts promoting self-harm, and political disinformation. New rules require comprehensive age verification, swift removal of illegal content, and addressing potential online harms to children. However, the Act has faced criticism for effectively empowering tech companies with significant control over acceptable speech and controversies surrounding privacy infringement due to a requirement for message scanning for illegal material. Compliance penalties are stringent, with potential fines of up to £18 million or 10% of annual revenue for non-compliant companies. Crucially, the discussion over end-to-end encryption remains unresolved, posing significant implications for user privacy and security on messaging platforms.","ref_id":null,"pub_date":1698324265.094,"attribution":"www.wired.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_68b79e5ba0bc800bb22261c498af8124","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for Online Safety Bill encryption and amendments","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"97a2992f0b280cc1-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"30a47a33-c98c-4617-9303-d07c2962f8ca","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"30a47a33-c98c-4617-9303-d07c2962f8ca","children":["d950de7a-23cb-43c3-b1f2-cf5d11b243ec"]},"d950de7a-23cb-43c3-b1f2-cf5d11b243ec":{"id":"d950de7a-23cb-43c3-b1f2-cf5d11b243ec","message":{"id":"d950de7a-23cb-43c3-b1f2-cf5d11b243ec","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1757042620.157717,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Crafting refined table and narrative","content":"I need to finalize the table and narrative.

Here’s a tighter, **reasoned** accountability matrix for the OSA—still a thought-experiment, but each % is tied to specific **decision rights**, **causal leverage**, and **dated actions**.

Without this push, the Bill could easily have slipped. citeturn4search8turn0search1\n\n- **Oliver Dowden (DCMS Sec, 2020–21)** — **8%**  \n  **Why:** He **published the draft Online Safety Bill (May 12, 2021)** and sold it as a manifesto delivery—formally moving the White Paper into a legislative project and triggering **pre-legislative scrutiny**. That made OSA a standing item on the parliamentary conveyor belt. citeturn3search2turn3search4\n\n- **Michelle Donelan (Culture/DSIT Sec, 2022–23)** — **7%**  \n  **Why:** She made the politically decisive **removal of “legal but harmful” for adults (Nov 29, 2022)**—the trade that kept the Bill alive—then stewarded it to **Royal Assent (26 Oct 2023)**. This was the settlement that converted years of drift into law. citeturn5search3turn5search9turn0search3\n\n- **Chris Philp (Digital Economy Minister, 2021–22)** — **6%**  \n  **Why:** Drove the **widening to commercial pornography sites** (not just social platforms), which later dominates user-visible enforcement (AV). A scope decision with high downstream impact. citeturn0search3\n\n- **Rishi Sunak (PM from Oct 2022)** — **6%**  \n  **Why:** He provided precious **legislative time** and accepted the **encryption “only when technically feasible”** posture that neutralised a potential kill-shot to the Bill in 2023. That choice traded controversy for passage. citeturn5search0turn5search2turn5search10\n\n- **Theresa May (PM 2016–19)** — **6%**  \n  **Why:** Set the **policy DNA**: **Digital Economy Act 2017 Part 3 (porn AV)** and the **Online Harms White Paper (Apr 2019, DCMS + Home Office)**. Even though the DEA AV scheme collapsed in 2019, those choices created the **child-safety/do-something** path the OSA followed. citeturn2search6turn2search0turn3search9turn3search1\n\n- **Jeremy Wright (DCMS Sec, 2018–19)** — **5%**  \n  **Why:** **Co-authored/launched** the White Paper with Sajid Javid; framed Ofcom as regulator and “duty of care” as the model—core scaffolding the OSA ultimately used. citeturn3search9turn3search1\n\n- **Sajid Javid (Home Sec, 2018–19)** — **4%**  \n  **Why:** The **security/child-protection framing** of the White Paper was driven heavily by the Home Office—key to cross-party optics that sustained momentum. citeturn3search9\n\n- **Damian Collins (Chair, Joint Committee on the Draft OSB 2021; later minister briefly)** — **3%**  \n  **Why:** Chaired the **pre-leg scrutiny** that legitimised a toughened Bill and kept Ofcom at the centre. Those recommendations shaped the version Dorries then introduced. citeturn0search4\n\n- **Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay (Lords minister)** — **2%**  \n  **Why:** **Piloted** the Bill through the Lords—procedural but essential final-mile role. citeturn0search3\n\n---\n\n## Labour (opposition sponsorship → government delivery) — **16%**\n\n- **Peter Kyle (Sec of State, DSIT, from Jul 2024)** — **10%**  \n  **Why:** **Implementation owner.** He **laid Ofcom’s first illegal-harms codes (Dec 16, 2024)**, set categorisation thresholds, and publicly set the **mid-March 2025** risk-assessment clock and **July 2025** compliance horizon.

Baroness Kidron; Molly Russell case/families)** — **3%**  \n  **Why:** Sustained **moral and media pressure** (esp. post-Molly Russell inquest and the coroner’s Prevention of Future Deaths report) made back-sliding politically toxic and kept child-safety at the centre. citeturn2search1turn2search11\n\n---\n\n## One-liners you can hang in the sub-section\n\n- **Conservatives own the architecture (66%)**: May/Wright/Javid created the policy chassis (2017–19); Dowden/Dorries/Philp made it a live Bill and hardened the illegal-content spine; Donelan/Sunak did the deals (legal-but-harmful out; encryption “when feasible”) to get it passed in 2023. citeturn3search9turn3search4turn0search1turn5search3turn5search0\n\n- **Labour owns delivery (16%)**: Starmer chose “build on it”, and **Peter Kyle** pushed Ofcom’s codes and commencement over the line, producing the 2025 user-visible changes (age checks, risk assessments). citeturn1search3turn4search15turn1news20\n\n- **Parliament + system pressure (18%)**: Cross-party votes, Lords scrutiny, **Ofcom** rule-making and **bereaved families’ campaigns** made delay untenable and shaped the enforcement tempo. citeturn5search11turn0search5turn2search1\n\n---\n\n### Why these numbers aren’t arbitrary\nEach % reflects (a) a dated, verifiable **decision or document**; (b) whether that act **advanced the critical path** (draft → intro → passage → codes → enforcement); and (c) the **counterfactual** (“absent this person, would the OSA likely look different / be later / not happen?”).

Implemented by Ofcom, the act mandates strict safeguards against harmful content like pornography and self-harm, with noncompliant companies subject to hefty fines and potential criminal charges. Platforms must now establish robust systems, rather than target individual content, to mitigate online harm.\n\nA particularly controversial provision requires age verification for access to pornography, raising privacy concerns but demanding adherence to UK GDPR standards. Social media may also need age checks to prevent under-18s from accessing harmful content.\n\nThe legislation was spurred by public advocacy following tragedies such as the death of Molly Russell, and gains support from figures like Baroness Kidron and Rio Ferdinand. However, some critics, including the children's commissioner, argue the measures don’t go far enough, and campaigners continue to push for tougher standards, including screen time limits.\n\nDespite concerns, the UK government insists that protecting children remains a top priority, and Ofcom is actively issuing guidance and consultations. Whether the act results in a significantly safer online environment will be evaluated in the coming years.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":61}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"The Guardian"},{"title":"What the UK's Online Safety Act means for IT companies","url":"https://www.itpro.com/business/policy-and-legislation/what-the-uks-online-safety-act-means-for-it-companies?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1752579339,"snippet":"The UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA), effective from 25 July 2025, mandates digital platforms—regardless of whether they are UK-based—to implement measures that protect users, especially children, from harmful and illegal content. Enforced by Ofcom, the act introduces strict compliance provisions, including risk assessments, design accountability for algorithms, and age assurance mechanisms. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to £18 million or 10% of global turnover. Ofcom released detailed codes of practice in April 2025, giving companies until July to align with new safety standards. While designed to enhance digital safety, the act raises concerns for smaller tech firms, citing high implementation costs, lack of clarity in defining “reasonable” measures, and potentially overbroad censorship. There are also apprehensions about undermining encryption and deterring market entry into the UK and EU. Despite these challenges, advocates argue the act is a crucial step toward safer digital environments. IT firms are urged to act quickly—conduct risk assessments, understand their obligations, and embed safety into their governance structures—to ensure timely compliance and avoid regulatory penalties.","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":0,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":62}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"IT Pro"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn2search1turn2search11","start_idx":6399,"end_idx":6432,"safe_urls":["https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Molly-Russell-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2022-0315_Published.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.leighday.co.uk/news/news/2022-news/molly-russell-coroner-calls-on-social-media-companies-to-take-action-on-harmful-content-to-prevent-further-deaths/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([Courts and Tribunals Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Molly-Russell-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2022-0315_Published.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Leigh Day](https://www.leighday.co.uk/news/news/2022-news/molly-russell-coroner-calls-on-social-media-companies-to-take-action-on-harmful-content-to-prevent-further-deaths/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"Molly Russell - Prevention of future deaths report","url":"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Molly-Russell-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2022-0315_Published.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1665674670,"snippet":"Oct 13, 2022 — The conclusion of the inquest was. “Molly Rose Russell died from an act of self-harm whilst suffering from depression and the negative ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":1}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Courts and Tribunals Judiciary"},{"title":"Molly Russell coroner calls on social media companies to ...","url":"https://www.leighday.co.uk/news/news/2022-news/molly-russell-coroner-calls-on-social-media-companies-to-take-action-on-harmful-content-to-prevent-further-deaths/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1665705600,"snippet":"Oct 14, 2022 — Senior Coroner Andrew Walker has issued a Prevention of Future Deaths report (PFD) to Meta, Pinterest, Twitter, Snapchat and the UK Government following the ...","attribution_segments":null,"supporting_websites":[],"refs":[{"turn_index":2,"ref_type":"search","ref_index":11}],"hue":null,"attributions":null,"attribution":"Leigh Day"}],"fallback_items":null,"status":"done","error":null,"style":null},{"matched_text":"citeturn3search9turn3search4turn0search1turn5search3turn5search0","start_idx":6776,"end_idx":6847,"safe_urls":["https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-11-29/hcws397?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-laws-to-protect-children-and-stop-abuse-online-published?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/online-safety-law-to-be-strengthened-to-stamp-out-illegal-content?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-introduce-world-first-online-safety-laws?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/technology/uk-minister-says-position-encryption-not-changed-2023-09-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"],"refs":[],"alt":"([GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-introduce-world-first-online-safety-laws?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [UK Parliament](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-11-29/hcws397?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/uk-minister-says-position-encryption-not-changed-2023-09-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))","prompt_text":null,"type":"grouped_webpages","items":[{"title":"UK to introduce world first online safety laws","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-introduce-world-first-online-safety-laws?utm_source=chatgpt.com","pub_date":1554710402,"snippet":"Apr 8, 2019 — Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, Home Office, The Rt Hon Sajid Javid and The Rt Hon Sir Jeremy Wright KC MP;

Larger platforms must do proactive scanning. | Less exposure to clearly criminal material; risk of **over-removal** (“better safe than sorry” takedowns). | **Live (Mar 2025):** Ofcom can fine non-compliant firms up to 10% global revenue. |\n| **“Priority illegal content” (fast-track offences)** | Certain crimes (child abuse images, grooming, terrorist propaganda, revenge porn, suicide encouragement, fraud) are categorised as **priority** → firms must act **proactively**, not just after reports. | Platforms will err on side of deletion; victims of abuse get quicker relief. But proactive filters can catch satire, activism, or evidence of abuse itself. | In force – Ofcom enforcing. |\n| **Child safety duties** | Services **likely to be accessed by children** must limit exposure to harmful content (porn, self-harm, eating disorders, violent imagery, etc). | Leads to **age checks** (ID, facial scans, credit card) on porn and some gaming/social apps. Children more shielded, but adults face privacy intrusions and lock-outs if they refuse to verify. | **25 July 2025** compliance deadline – now rolling out (Steam, Xbox, porn sites). |\n| **Age assurance / verification** | Sites with pornographic content must prove visitors are 18+. Methods vary (ID upload, credit card, AI face estimation). | Children face higher barriers to access; adults lose anonymity in certain contexts. Privacy varies by provider—**trusted vs. “shoddy SaaS”** matters. | Enforced by Ofcom since July 2025. |\n| **Risk assessments (illegal & child harms)** | All in-scope services must regularly assess risks of illegal/harmful content and report them. | Users don’t see this directly, but it shapes what moderation tools get built. Failure → Ofcom penalties. | First assessments due Mar–Apr 2025. |\n| **User empowerment tools** | Big platforms must let adults **filter out legal but harmful material** (e.g. racist abuse, misogyny, self-harm). | Adults can switch on filters for safer feeds, but no obligation to remove that content entirely. | Design changes will roll out 2025–26. |\n| **Fraud & scam protection** | Platforms must prevent fraudulent ads and scam promotions. | Fewer dodgy investment ads, ticket scams, and fake shops in feeds. | Enforcement underway; Ofcom codes apply. |\n| **Protection for journalists & democratic content** | Extra safeguards to avoid accidental removal of “recognised news publisher” content, political speech, or journalistic investigations. | Reduces risk of political reporting being caught in moderation sweeps. Grey area: activists and citizen journalists not always protected. | Baked into Act; tested in Ofcom guidance. |\n| **Encryption powers (deferred)** | Ofcom technically has powers to require message-scanning on encrypted apps (WhatsApp, Signal) *if “technically feasible.”* | Creates **future risk** to private messaging; not used immediately. Campaigners warn of a chilling effect. | Govt said (Sept 2023) won’t use powers until workable tech exists. |\n| **Fines & liability** | Ofcom can fine up to **10% of global revenue** or block services in the UK. | Gives teeth: even US giants can’t ignore UK rules. Potential knock-on effect: global platforms may redesign systems UK-wide. | Active since Mar 2025. |\n| **Transparency & reporting** | Platforms must publish annual reports on moderation, risks, and compliance. | Public and researchers get more insight into how harmful content spreads (if reports are honest). | Starting 2025; Ofcom reviews reports. |\n| **Empowered regulator (Ofcom)** | Ofcom gains sweeping powers: to demand data, audit systems, approve codes, issue fines, or block services. | Centralises online regulation in one body. Public may benefit from more consistent enforcement—but some fear Ofcom’s **“super-regulator” role** risks political capture. | Ofcom in enforcement phase. |\n\n---\n\n# **The Big Picture: Outcomes**\n\n- **Already clear**:  \n  - **Age verification** = biggest visible change for users (privacy concern, access hurdles).  \n  - Platforms facing huge compliance costs → nudging them to **over-moderate**.  \n  - Scam/fraud ads **falling**, though not gone.  \n\n- **Likely near-term effects** (2025–26):  \n  - Safer environments for children (less easy porn/self-harm content).  \n  - More “blunt” removals → political satire, activism, or sexual content flagged incorrectly.  \n  - Privacy vs. protection debate intensifies around AV and encryption.  \n\n- **Longer-term forecast**:  \n  - UK could set a **regulatory template** other countries borrow.  \n  - Ofcom’s role will grow, but trust in the regulator will be constantly tested.  \n  - Public perception may lag: many people may still mostly **feel the intrusions (ID checks, takedowns)** more than the protections.  \n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to produce a **“what existed before vs what OSA adds” companion table** (like we sketched with revenge porn) so it’s clear which harms were already illegal, and what’s actually new? That might sharpen the “this isn’t all new law, it’s new duties for platforms” message."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-p-68acbab14fe08191bfa946c0512151e3","request_id":"97a2b54dbf4cba87-MXP","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5","default_model_slug":"gpt-5","parent_id":"36643731-31a4-4deb-b66d-5d458096bc74","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"36643731-31a4-4deb-b66d-5d458096bc74","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"43a4f80f-3c6c-4baf-af2b-17138d9b258d","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"68b79e57-3908-832b-8830-8350a88dd720","conversation_template_id":"g-p-68acbab14fe08191bfa946c0512151e3","gizmo_id":"g-p-68acbab14fe08191bfa946c0512151e3","gizmo_type":"snorlax","is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":["https://www.dentons.com/en/insights/articles/2024/november/8/what-are-the-key-uk-online-safety-act-dates-you-need-to-know-now?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tech/15267896/xbox-age-verification-microsoft-online-safety-act-rules/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_Dorries?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/31/age-verification-uk-porn-sites/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/articles/Successes%2Band%2Bsetbacks%2BICO%2Breports%2Bon%2BFOI%2Bcompliance%2Bacross%2BNHS%2Btrusts%2Bin%2BEngland%2B25072025111000?open=&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/farage-wants-to-enable-modern-day-jimmy-saviles-says-jess-phillips-t8fj3xbzs?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2024/dnr-executive-summary?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/sep/01/news-avoidance-high-anxiety?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efc57ed3a6f4023d242ed56/Final_report_1_July_2020_.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/consultations/category-1-10-weeks/statement-protecting-children-from-harms-online/main-document/volume-1-overview-scope-and-regulatory-approach.pdf?v=396663&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Safety_Amendment?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.communicatemagazine.com/features/2024/the-journalism-pr-crunch-a-shifting-landscape/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-07-07/hlws191?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/online-safety-act-dark-web-nigel-farage-2lnfgvbds?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thetimes.co.uk/imageserver/image/%2F8aa2724d-f43a-4e14-8a69-c4bb6b1b95dd.jpg?crop=1609%2C1073%2C4%2C7&resize=500","https://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2024/news/reach-bosses-in-drive-to-increase-journalists-story-volumes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-ditches-ban-legal-harmful-online-content-favour-free-speech-2022-11-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2019/october/uq-on-online-pornography-age-verification/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11405697/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.bdo.co.uk/en-gb/insights/advisory/risk-and-advisory-services/uks-online-safety-act-2023-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ofcom-acting-as-global-censorship-bureau-us-tech-firms-claim-5ks0s3rxn?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.itpro.com/business/policy-and-legislation/what-the-uks-online-safety-act-means-for-it-companies?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/uk-steam-users-must-register-credit-card-for-adult-content?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Safety_Act_2023?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/16/uk-drops-plans-for-online-pornography-age-verification-system?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/45744-which-media-outlets-do-britons-trust-2023?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/watchdog-rebukes-government-for-blocking-times-foi-request-xpg9hxjm3?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wms/?id=2024-12-16.hcws312.h&utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.axios.com/2022/03/17/uk-introduces-online-safety-bill?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://techpolicy.press/the-uks-online-safety-bill-where-is-it-now?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/media/google-ai-tools-depressing-traffic-to-news-sites-report/?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/apr/01/i-cant-cope-with-it-any-more-newsrooms-scramble-to-retain-audiences-amid-the-big-switch-off?utm_so
