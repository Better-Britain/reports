# NHS Recovery: Cutting Waiting Times and Backlogs

[status: programme] [lead: DHSC/NHS England] [start: 2024-07] [horizon: medium]

**Intent:** Bring down hospital waiting lists and speed up treatment, so more people are seen within target times in planned (elective) care and emergency departments. [^nhs-plan-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Extra operating lists (evenings/weekends), surgical hubs, community diagnostic centres, targeted funding for high-volume specialties, and operational grip on A&E standards. [^erp-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: nhs] [horizon: short] Overall waiting list edged down to ~7.36 million by late spring 2025, with record monthly elective activity (about 1.5 million treatments in May). [^nhs-stats-2025-05]
- [impact-proven] [area: nhs] [horizon: short] Emergency departments saw the best four‑hour performance since 2021 after targeted recovery actions. [^nhs-uec-2025]
- [unknown] Sustaining the pace depends on winter pressures, workforce supply, and theatre capacity. [^nao-nhs-ops-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Multi‑year Elective Recovery Plan funding (~£8bn over the period), plus capital for surgical hubs and diagnostics. [^erp-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Faster treatment benefits patients nationwide; biggest gains expected where hubs and diagnostic centres are concentrated. [^nhs-cdc-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Theatre staffing, bed availability, winter spikes. [risk: capital] Backlog of estates upgrades. [^ifg-nhs-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** 2024–25: ramp elective volumes and diagnostics; 2026: embed sustained RTT improvements; ongoing A&E performance recovery. [^nhs-plan-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Clear progress visible, with risks around sustaining throughput.

# Ending Strikes and Stabilising the Workforce (Pay Deals)
[status: enacted] [lead: DHSC/NHS England] [start: 2024-07] [horizon: short]

**Intent:** End disruptive industrial action and restore staffing stability through fair pay offers, so patients see fewer cancelled appointments. [^bma-deal-2024]

**Mechanism(s):** Pay agreements with junior doctors and other staff groups; honouring independent pay review body awards; backdated uplifts. [^prb-2024]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: nhs] [horizon: short] Junior doctors accepted a two‑year settlement (around 22% combined), ending strikes and enabling service recovery. [^bma-deal-2024]
- [impact-likely] [area: nhs] [horizon: short] Fewer cancellations and better rota stability improve patient flow. [^nhs-ops-2025]
- [unknown] Affordability pressures may return at the next pay round. [^ifs-pay-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Higher pay bill in‑year; partly offset by reduced strike disruption and improved productivity. [^treasury-pay-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Benefits patients (fewer cancellations) and staff morale; budget trade‑offs elsewhere in the system. [^ifs-pay-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: finance] Tight fiscal envelope; [risk: political] future pay expectations. [^ifs-pay-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** 2024–25 deals implemented; 2025–26 pay round under negotiation within new cost controls. [^prb-2025]

**Outcome score:** +2 — Immediate service stability gain and public benefit.

# NHS Strikes Return and Performance Heat
[status: consideration] [lead: DHSC/NHS England/Unions] [start: 2025-09] [horizon: short]

**Intent (observed):** Consultant strike ballots, “corridor care” headlines and waiting‑time pressure mixed with some positive metrics, creating a complex public picture. [^guardian-nhs-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Pay negotiations; industrial action ballots; operational recovery plans. 

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] Fresh strike votes; persistent pressure on urgent and emergency care. [^guardian-nhs-2025]
- [impact-likely] Progress on elective recovery risks being overshadowed during strikes.
- [unknown] Duration and breadth of new industrial action.

**Costs & funding:** Strike‑related costs and lost activity; recovery funding already in train.

# Modernising Data and Digital Care
[status: programme] [lead: DHSC/NHS England] [start: 2025-07] [horizon: medium]

**Intent:** Give every patient a single electronic record, expand the NHS App so people can book and manage care, and test safe uses of AI to cut admin and speed diagnosis. [^nhs-digital-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** National standards for electronic patient records (EPR), App features (self‑referral, prescriptions), “advice and guidance” between GPs and specialists, and pilot projects for clinical AI tools. [^nhs-digital-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: nhs] [horizon: short] “Advice & Guidance” avoided around 1 million referrals in 8–12 months, freeing hospital slots. [^nhs-ag-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: nhs] [horizon: medium] A single record reduces duplicate tests and errors, improving safety. [^nhs-epr-2025]
- [unknown] Real‑world AI gains and guardrails (bias, safety) still being proven. [^aap-ai-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Capital for IT systems and connectivity; training staff to use tools well. [^nhs-tech-cap-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Better access (especially for people who can use digital services) but must guard against digital exclusion. [^nhs-dig-incl-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Integration across many vendors; [risk: security] cyber risks; [risk: equity] inclusion. [^nao-it-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** By 2028: universal basic EPR coverage; phased App features; AI pilots with published evaluations. [^nhs-digital-2025]
