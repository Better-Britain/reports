# National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) — Targets, Presumption and “Grey‑belt”
[status: programme] [lead: DLUHC] [start: 2024-07] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Restore a clear national push to build more homes by bringing back local targets, tightening the “presumption in favour of sustainable development”, and allowing limited use of poor‑quality Green Belt (“grey‑belt”) land where it unlocks housing near jobs and transport. [^dluhc-nppf-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Revised national policy (NPPF) and ministerial directions to planning inspectors; updated guidance to local plans and five‑year land supply tests. [^hoclib-nppf-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-likely] [area: housing] [horizon: medium] Restoring targets is expected to raise permissions toward the level needed for 300k/yr builds. [^hoclib-nppf-2025]
- [impact-hypothetical] [area: housing] Limited “grey‑belt” use can add well‑located capacity with lower environmental harm if paired with design codes. [^dluhc-nppf-2025]
- [unknown] Delivery depends on local plan adoption rates and inspector capacity. [^nao-planning-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Minimal central cost; council plan‑making and inspection time increase. [^dluhc-ia-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Most impact in high‑demand city‑regions; potential affordability gains for renters and first‑time buyers. [^ifs-housing-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: legal][risk: political] Local opposition; judicial review risk; infrastructure and water constraints in hotspots. [^defra-nutrient-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Draft NPPF issued 2024–25; examination guidance updated; local plans to align over 2025–27. [^dluhc-nppf-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Directionally pro‑build; reliant on local plan throughput and inspectorate capacity.
