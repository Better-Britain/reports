# 5.1 — Glossary and Abbreviations

This glossary explains the evaluation language and systems terms we use across the report. It focuses on how policies work, how they interact with other systems, and how we talk about evidence and risk. It is not a directory of agency names.

## Scoring and evidence
- Outcome score: A simple judgement from −2 to +2 about near‑term outcomes. It can change as evidence grows.
- Positive/negative balance: Whether early benefits outweigh harms (or the reverse) at this point in time.
- Impact‑proven: Results backed by delivered outputs or robust evaluation.
- Impact‑likely: Strong rationale and early indicators, but more time/data needed.
- Impact‑hypothetical: Plausible mechanism with little current evidence.
- Unknown: A material uncertainty or missing data that limits conclusions.
- Opinion: An interpretive statement; we try to mark these clearly.
- Time horizons: Short (<1 year), Medium (1–3 years), Long (>3 years). Signals when effects should show up.

## Distribution and equity
- Distributional effects: Who gains or loses (by income, region, age, sector). Averages can hide uneven impacts.
- Targeting: Directing a policy or funding at specific groups or places to improve fairness or value for money.

## Risks and constraints
- Delivery risk: Can the system actually do it (capacity, skills, kit, supply chains)?
- Legal risk: Courts or compliance rules may limit or delay action (e.g., judicial review).
- Finance risk: Can it be funded now and later; what happens if costs rise?
- Political risk: Consent, controversy, or shifts in priorities that change pace or shape.
- Data‑gap risk: Weak, late, or missing data that obscures outcomes.

## Delivery mechanics (how things move)
- Sequencing: Ordering steps so later tasks aren’t blocked (e.g., grid first, build second).
- Pipeline: The staged flow of projects from idea to delivery; often slowed by shared bottlenecks.
- Bottleneck: The slowest step that limits overall throughput (e.g., planning capacity, grid connections).
- Throughput: How much work the system can push through per period (cases, consents, surgeries).
- Surge vs. steady‑state: Short‑term push to cut queues vs. durable process/capacity improvements.
- Triage: Sorting work by complexity/urgency so simple cases move fast.
- Dependencies: Things that must happen before others (planning → grid → build).

## Money and incentives
- Capex / Opex: Capital spending on assets vs. day‑to‑day running costs.
- Contingent liability: A promise that may cost money in future (e.g., guarantees).
- Leverage / crowd‑in: Public money used to attract private investment.
- Revolving fund: Money repaid by projects is recycled into new ones.
- Ring‑fenced: Funds locked to a purpose (can’t be diverted easily).

## Law, rules and accountability
- Primary legislation: An Act of Parliament that sets the main powers/rules.
- Secondary legislation (statutory instruments): Detailed rules made under an Act.
- Codes and guidance: What regulators publish to explain how rules work day to day.
- Compliance and enforcement: How rules are checked and breaches are acted on (audits, fines, conditions).
- Governance: Who decides, who is accountable, and how performance is overseen.

## Planning, consents and infrastructure
- Consents/permits: Legal approvals required before building or operating.
- Strategic policy: High‑level rules (e.g., national policy statements) that steer local decisions.
- Connection queue: Line for access to shared infrastructure (e.g., power grid). Clearing the queue often needs new rules or investment.
- Anticipatory investment: Building enabling infrastructure before demand fully arrives to avoid future delays.

## System design and organisation
- Integration: Joining services, budgets or data so users experience one coherent system.
- Devolution: Shifting powers/budgets from the centre to member nations, regions or cities.
- Single‑pot settlement: One multi‑year local budget that replaces many small grants, enabling planning.
- Franchising (transport): Local control of routes, fares and standards via contracts with operators.
- Resilience: The ability to absorb shocks and recover (e.g., storms, cyber incidents).

## Digital, data and identity
- Smart Data: Letting people and small firms share their own data securely to get better deals/services.
- Digital identity (trust mark / certification): Providers meet standards so people can prove attributes (age, right to work) with privacy and consent.
- Interoperability: Systems can talk to each other using common standards.
- Privacy and redress: Clear consent, minimal data use, and routes to fix problems when things go wrong.

## Measurement and evaluation
- Baseline: The starting point used to judge change.
- Leading vs. lagging indicators: Early signals (inputs/throughputs) vs. later outcomes.
- Pilot / trial: A limited test to learn what works before scaling.
- Attribution vs. contribution: Separating what the policy caused from what other factors did.

## Communications and public trust
- Optics: How actions look to the public, separate from technical merit.
- Narrative risk: A single incident or storyline can shape perceptions more than the broader data.

If a term is unclear or missing, please open an issue so we can add or improve it. The goal is plain English first, with just enough precision to compare policies fairly.
