# Approach

<div class="tag-codes">

We gathered as many Labour policies and meaningful non‑policy events as we could find since the 2024 general election. Most formal programmes and legislation, plus events and outcomes linked to government decisions, delivery choices or public comms.

The research was organised into policy groups. For each policy or incident, we produced a short policy card entry with a consistent set of fields: the intent(s), the main mechanisms, key claims and evidence, costs and funding, distributional effects, risks and constraints, a brief timeline, and an outcome score.

If you spot something we should correct or expand, please open an issue or pull request [on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Better-Britain/).

## Scoring process

Every card has an outcome score on a simple five‑point scale from −2 to +2. The score is a subjective estimate of the balance of likely benefits and harms. It is not a prediction and it can change over time.

- <span class="score-help score-2">`+2` - strong/clear positive outcomes, present or very likely.</span>
- <span class="score-help score-1">`+1` - modest positive outcomes or progress, sometimes with caveats.</span>
- <span class="score-help score-0">`0` - unclear or balanced impacts, or too early to tell.</span>
- <span class="score-help score--1">`−1` - modest negative outcomes or notable risks outweighing benefits.</span>
- <span class="score-help score--2">`−2` serious negative outcomes or high‑risk decisions/costs with little offsetting value.</span>

All scores remain open to revision as new evidence arrives or different perspectives are offered. 

## Scoring consistency

A broader range of scores was considered, and would express more nuance in complex issues, but assigning a subjective score to every policy means we make decisions about which influences/outcomes are more important than others. A narrow range keeps the system simple and clear.

A weighted approach was also considered (is nuclear energy capacity more or less important than consistent building regulations around single-sex spaces?), but that very quickly shows limitations, and enhances bias. We're not trying to make any one perspective more important than any other, but to consider the overall effects of decisions made and the plans laid out.

We also considered testing policy performance against Conservative policies of the last few years (with post-COVID as the primary timespan), but the noise level in reporting was WAY too high, it just didn't have enough comparable policy to bother.

Our scoring is intended to be seen as comparable to better or worse governance outcomes, reducing the overall potential range lets us define how broad this scale _could_ be.

Practically, our scale runs from "the worst any government could be expected to do" to "the best any government could be expected to do".

## Taxonomy and tags

<details>
<summary>
To make the content filterable and to keep the write‑ups short, we use a small set of tags. Expand for details.
</summary>
Impact quality describes how confident we are in a claim:

- ✅ `[impact-proven]` is supported by direct evidence, delivered outputs or robust evaluation.
- ↗ `[impact-likely]` has strong rationale and early indicators but needs time to confirm.
- ◇ `[impact-hypothetical]` is a plausible mechanism with little or no current evidence.
- ？ `[unknown]` flags a material uncertainty or missing data.
- 💬 `[opinion]` marks a clearly interpretive statement.

Areas of effect help group by domain. Common examples include: ⚡ `[area: energy]`, 💧 `[area: water]`, 🏠 `[area: housing]`, 🗺 `[area: planning]`, 🏥 `[area: nhs]`, 🧑‍⚕️ `[area: social-care]`, 👪 `[area: welfare]`, 🎓 `[area: education]`, 🧰 `[area: skills]`, 🛂 `[area: migration]`, ⚖ `[area: justice]`, £ `[area: economy]`, 🧾 `[area: fiscal]`, 🏛 `[area: devolution]`, 💻 `[area: digital]`, 🤖 `[area: ai]`, 🌿 `[area: environment]`, 🏢 `[area: business]`, 👷 `[area: labour-market]`, 🚆 `[area: transport]`, 🎭 `[area: culture]`, 🌍 `[area: foreign]`, 🛡 `[area: defence]`.

Time horizons describe when effects should become visible: ⏱ `[horizon: short]` (under 1 year), ⏳ `[horizon: medium]` (1–3 years), and 🕰 `[horizon: long]` (over 3 years).

Distributional tags highlight who is most affected. For example: 💷 `[dist: low-income]`, 👵 `[dist: pensioners]`, 🔑 `[dist: renters]`, 🏡 `[dist: homeowners]`, 🏪 `[dist: SMEs]`, 🏢 `[dist: large-firms]`, and regional tags like 📍 `[dist: regions:Greater Manchester]`.

Risk and uncertainty tags call out the main constraints. We use ⚖ `[risk: legal]`, 🏗 `[risk: delivery]`, £ `[risk: finance]`, 🏛 `[risk: political]` and 📊 `[risk: data-gap]` to signpost what might go wrong or what we do not yet know.

Cards also have a small “meta line” under the title. Common tags there include: ✅ `[status: enacted]` / 🛠 `[status: programme]`, 🏛 `[lead: department/body]`, 📅 `[start: YYYY-MM]`, and (again) the time horizon tags above.

## Citations and references

We use inline footnotes for every material claim: `[^id]`. The page renderer pulls all citations together so all evidenced claims should have links that inform the claim. You can toggle on/off the full titles of those links here.

## Style and voice

We aim for clarity over jargon, short paragraphs over dense blocks, and concrete examples over abstract claims. We focus on people and outcomes. See the [Writing Voice & Style guide](./style-guide.html) for more detail on tone and presentation.

## Roadmap and open questions

Two near‑term improvements are on the list. 
- Ratings will be adjusted over time, and while updates will be limited (maybe quarterly), this report will develop into an ongoing 'report card' for Labour's government over time.
  - The next update will probably start by renaming the report
- Filtering/sorting based on tags of various types _might_ be useful.
  - Policy cards take up a lot of the viewport, maybe field-toggles and a table view will help
- The citation toggle should be easier to use during scroll
