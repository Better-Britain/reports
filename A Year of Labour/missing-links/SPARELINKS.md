These are links we know the LLM used as references, but where the citation-id was lost on export. Need to be manually consolidated into 5.0-Source-Citations.md after referencing against the output policy docs in the UI (HTML generator will flag missing references).

Lesson learned: Neither ChatGPT nor Grok reliably export citations via my export scripts, they're not 'inside' the page markdown content.
