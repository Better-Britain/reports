## Initial framing (2025-08-20)

We started with a “Sensible & effective / Questionable or poorly executed / Unclear or too‑early‑to‑judge” triage. It helped for a first pass, but it wasn’t enough to capture complex outcomes. We moved to per‑policy cards with a −2…+2 score, evidence tags and distributional notes, with human review on top of automated hints.
