## Dataset refresh (2026-02-13)

- Updated coverage through 13 February 2026 (Sep 2025 → Feb 2026 refresh window)
- Added/updated big-ticket items across: clean energy delivery (GBE rollout, Local Power Plan, CfD AR7, grid connections/investment), water reform direction, housing/planning (Renters’ Rights Act + commencements, Planning and Infrastructure Act, homelessness plan), workplace rights/enforcement (Employment Rights Act + Fair Work Agency), migration/asylum (Border Security Act + asylum/returns statement), justice (Sentencing Act), and digital rules (DVS statutory regime, Online Safety enforcement, digital assets property act)
- Updated the “money and rules” backdrop (Budget/Finance Bill, plus planned carbon border tax / CBAM), and a small number of governance/media events where they could affect delivery

## Initial framing (2025-08-25)

We started with a “Sensible & effective / Questionable or poorly executed / Unclear or too‑early‑to‑judge” triage. It helped for a first pass, but it wasn’t enough to capture complex outcomes. We moved to per‑policy cards with a −2…+2 score, evidence tags and distributional notes, with human review on top of automated hints.
