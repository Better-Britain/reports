# 2.12 — Foreign, Defence and Security

Scope: Defence spending path; posture and alliances; procurement and industrial base; cyber and national resilience; Ukraine and wider foreign policy signals.

## Policy Group Notes

- Opportunity costs vs domestic budgets: track the balance between defence increases and other services; note mitigation (procurement reform, joint buys).
- Delivery bottlenecks: stockpile rebuild times, industrial capacity, accommodation upgrades.
- Alliances and interoperability: NATO force assignments, joint exercises, shared munitions standards, and export controls.

[status: programme] [lead: MOD/HMT] [start: 2025-02] [horizon: medium]

**Intent:** Lift the UK’s defence budget to 2.5% of national income by 2027 to rebuild military capability and meet alliance expectations. [^mod-budget-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Multi‑year spending plans; Spring/Autumn fiscal events; Strategic Defence Review (SDR) alignment; savings and reprioritisations across departments. [^hmt-sr-2025; ^sdr-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: defence] [horizon: short] Initial uplift of ~£2.2bn in 2025/26 allocated to kit, munitions and readiness. [^hmt-sr-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: defence] [horizon: medium] Trajectory set to reach ~2.5% by 2027 subject to GDP path. [^obr-2025]
- [unknown] Sensitivity to growth/inflation—target could slip if the economy underperforms. [^ifs-brief-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Additional £ per year rising to several £bn by 2027; funded by top‑slicing, efficiency, and overall fiscal headroom. Trade‑offs with non‑defence budgets. [^hmt-sr-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Defence industry jobs across UK supply chains; opportunity costs for civil departments if settlements tighten. [^beis-supply-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: finance] Macroeconomic headwinds; [risk: delivery] absorption capacity in MOD and industry; [risk: political] competing claims on public spending. [^nao-def-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Funded via the spending path; stockpiles require multi‑year contracts. [^hmt-sr-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Benefits to Army/Navy/RAF readiness; industry workload across munitions and sustainment. [^beis-supply-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Training pipeline capacity; estate condition; [risk: supply] industry lead times. [^nao-def-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** 2025 review; 2026 force assignment to NATO; annual readiness audits. [^nato-returns-2025]
