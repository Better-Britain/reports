Scope: Cleaning up rivers and beaches; tougher regulation of water companies; investment, enforcement, and transparency.

---

# Water (Special Measures) Act 2025 — Implementation
[status: enacted] [lead: DEFRA/Ofwat/Environment Agency] [start: 2025-05] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Give regulators sharper tools to stop sewage pollution and poor service, and to make company bosses personally accountable. [^defra-special-measures-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Primary legislation; Ofwat directions; Environment Agency (EA) enforcement powers; bonus-ban powers for failing firms; civil penalty thresholds and automatic sanctions. [^defra-special-measures-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: water] [horizon: short] Executive bonuses have been banned at multiple worst-performing companies (including Thames and Yorkshire Water). [^defra-bonus-ban-2025]
- [impact-proven] [area: environment] [horizon: short] Record penalties issued for spills and unlawful dividend practices (e.g., £122.7m for Thames Water). [^thames-penalty-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: environment] [horizon: medium] Real-time monitoring and automatic fines are expected to cut routine sewage discharges. [^ea-monitoring-2025]
- [unknown] The size of bill impacts from compliance costs depends on how efficiently companies deliver upgrades. [^ofwat-bill-impact-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Company-funded upgrades; fines and penalties ring-fenced for cleanup projects; hardship support to be protected in company plans. [^ofwat-bill-impact-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Cleaner rivers benefit all users; near-term bill pressure could hit low-income households unless social tariffs and support schemes are strengthened. [^ccwater-distribution-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Complex engineering works; [risk: finance] highly leveraged company balance sheets; [risk: legal] potential challenges to penalties/bonus bans. [^nao-water-risk-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Act in force 2025; bonus-ban directions summer 2025; updated company plans and new penalty schedule through 2025–26. [^defra-special-measures-2025]

**Outcome score:** +2 — Stronger accountability with early visible enforcement; watch delivery and bill impacts.

# Ofwat Price Review (PR24) — 2025–2030 Settlements
[status: enacted] [lead: Ofwat] [start: 2025-04] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Approve multi-year investment to modernise pipes and treatment works, while setting limits on bills and service standards across 2025–2030. [^ofwat-pr24-overview]

**Mechanism(s):** Regulatory price control (PR24): capital programmes, performance commitments (leakage, pollution), outcome delivery incentives (rewards/penalties). [^ofwat-pr24-method]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: environment] [horizon: medium] Around £104 billion across 2025–30 for upgrades, including storm-overflow storage and treatment capacity. [^ofwat-pr24-overview]
- [impact-likely] [area: water] [horizon: medium] Targets to reduce spills and leakage, backed by financial incentives and penalties. [^ofwat-pr24-commitments]
- [unknown] Actual customer bill paths depend on company performance and financing costs. [^ofwat-bill-impact-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Company capex financed via shareholders and debt; bills set by Ofwat; penalties cannot be passed straight to customers. [^ofwat-pr24-method]

**Distributional effects:** Regional variation in bills reflecting local investment needs; low-income support required (social tariffs, payment plans). [^ccwater-distribution-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Supply chain capacity and skilled labour; [risk: finance] higher interest rates; [risk: political] bill acceptability. [^nao-water-risk-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Final determinations 2024/25; company business plans commence April 2025; annual performance reporting each summer. [^ofwat-pr24-overview]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Big step-up in investment with tougher targets; success hinges on on-time delivery and fair bill profiles.

# Thames Water Crisis — Special Administration Preparedness
[status: consideration] [lead: DEFRA/Ofwat/HMT] [start: 2025-07] [horizon: short]

**Intent (observed):** Government prepared for potential special administration while seeking a market‑led rescue, drawing criticism over fines “breathing space” and clarity. [^reuters-thames-2025; ^guardian-thames-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Regulator oversight; insolvency/special administration tools; contingent planning. [^reuters-thames-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] Ministers stated no special treatment under rules; contingency work ongoing. [^reuters-thames-2025]
- [impact-likely] Clearer comms on consumer protection and polluter‑pays needed. [^guardian-thames-2025]
- [unknown] Final restructuring terms and customer bill impacts.

**Costs & funding:** Contingent liabilities; potential consumer impacts depending on outcome.

**Distributional effects:** Customers and regions served affected by service and bill path.

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: finance] Balance‑sheet fragility; [risk: political] fairness perceptions; [risk: delivery] legal/insolvency timelines.

**Timeline & milestones:** Minister statements July–Sept 2025; restructuring decisions pending. [^reuters-thames-2025]

**Outcome score:** −1 — Necessary contingency, but messaging and outcomes matter.

# Environment Agency Enforcement — Polluters Pay
[status: programme] [lead: Environment Agency (EA)/DEFRA] [start: 2025-04] [horizon: short]

**Intent (plain language):** Scale up criminal and civil enforcement against serious polluters, and speed up penalties for repeated lower-level offences. [^ea-enforcement-plan-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Expanded inspection teams; expedited civil sanctions; criminal prosecutions for serious and persistent breaches; cost recovery from offenders. [^ea-enforcement-plan-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: environment] [horizon: short] More live criminal investigations at underperforming companies; rapid fixed penalties for minor, repeated breaches. [^ea-enforcement-stats-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: water] [horizon: short] Transparent publication of incidents and enforcement outcomes increases deterrence. [^ea-monitoring-2025]
- [unknown] Prosecution backlogs and court capacity could slow cases. [^moj-capacity-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Funded by DEFRA settlement; fine revenues directed to environmental improvements; polluter-pays cost recovery. [^defra-enforcement-funding-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Local communities near affected rivers get targeted cleanup projects; long-term health and recreation benefits. [^public-health-water-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: legal] Litigation risk from companies; [risk: delivery] forensic evidence and lab capacity; [risk: political] perceived inconsistency across regions. [^nao-water-risk-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Enhanced enforcement guidance issued 2025; quarterly enforcement bulletins; annual progress review. [^ea-enforcement-plan-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Visible enforcement ups the pressure; court throughput is the main constraint.

# Storm Overflow Reduction Programme — Monitoring & Targets
[status: programme] [lead: Ofwat/EA/Water Companies] [start: 2025-01] [horizon: medium]

**Intent (plain language):** Cut raw sewage spills into rivers and seas, with full monitoring, public transparency, and deadlines to halve spills by 2030. [^storm-overflow-plan-2030]

**Mechanism(s):** Mandatory event duration monitors (EDMs) on all overflows; near-real-time publication; new storage and treatment capacity; performance targets with penalties. [^ea-monitoring-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-proven] [area: transparency] [horizon: short] Monitoring now covers almost all overflows, with public data feeds. [^ea-monitoring-2025]
- [impact-likely] [area: environment] [horizon: medium] Storage, screening, and treatment upgrades reduce spill frequency and duration. [^ofwat-pr24-overview]
- [unknown] Extreme rainfall events could mask progress year-to-year; long time-series needed. [^met-office-rainfall-2025]

**Costs & funding:** Included within PR24 capex; penalties for missed targets cannot be recouped from customers. [^ofwat-pr24-method]

**Distributional effects:** Cleaner bathing waters and amenity value for coastal and river communities; construction disruption near assets. [^public-health-water-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: delivery] Gridlocked planning for large tanks/tunnels; [risk: finance] contractor costs; [risk: legal] permits and consents. [^planning-consents-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** 100% monitoring coverage targeted; interim spill reduction checkpoints 2027; at least 50% reduction by 2030. [^storm-overflow-plan-2030]

**Outcome score:** +2 — Clear plan with transparency and penalties; delivery is hard but benefits are broad.

# Unified Water Regulator — Proposal to Merge Functions
[status: programme] [lead: DEFRA] [start: 2025-07] [horizon: long]

**Intent (plain language):** End the “blame game” between agencies by creating a single, accountable regulator for water quality, customer service, and investment. [^defra-unified-regulator-2025]

**Mechanism(s):** Policy proposal for legislation: bring together Ofwat (economic regulator), the Environment Agency’s water functions (environmental enforcement), Natural England (ecology advice), and the Drinking Water Inspectorate (safety), into one body. [^defra-unified-regulator-2025]

**Key claims & evidence:**
- [impact-likely] [area: governance] [horizon: medium] One regulator reduces duplication and speeds decisions; clearer accountability for outcomes. [^ifg-regulation-2025]
- [unknown] Transition costs, staffing transfers, and statutory powers until legislation passes. [^defra-unified-regulator-2025]

**Costs & funding:** One-off transition costs; expected efficiencies from shared data and enforcement teams; funding model to be set in the bill. [^defra-unified-regulator-2025]

**Distributional effects:** Simpler contact point for customers and local groups; potential short-term disruption during merger. [^ccwater-distribution-2025]

**Risks & constraints:** [risk: legal] Legislative time; [risk: delivery] moving staff and systems; [risk: political] scope creep and independence concerns. [^ifg-regulation-2025]

**Timeline & milestones:** Consultation 2025; draft bill preparation; staged transition after Royal Assent. [^defra-unified-regulator-2025]

**Outcome score:** +1 — Governance fix with promise, but depends on a good bill and careful transition.
