# Writing Voice & Style

Plainspoken, direct, and human. Angry in drafts, clear in print.

## Voice
- Direct, honest, avoid management‑speak
- Constructively critical: point to what’s broken and why it matters
- Empathetic without melodrama; frustration comes from care
- Tie policy to people

## Style
- Reading level: accessible, natural; short paragraphs and clear headings
- Flow: 
    - Break arguments into chunks; 
    - Use bullets when it helps
- Shareable lines: keep quotable sentences self‑contained
- Evidence with punch: 
    - Numbers in plain terms
    - No 'double-decker buses' that over-simplify and obscure

## Tone
- Professional but natural
    - Telling your Grandma what you do at work
- Avoid our own TLAs (Three Letter Acronyms), and expand on first and on occasional repeated uses
- Intent lives with the reader
    - Wry and dry humour or mild exaggeration _can_ support a point, but don't rely on it being interpreted as intended
    - Perfect 'neutral' phrasing can be read as uncaring or even hostile.
- Distinguish analysis vs. commentary
    - Opinion can spoil a fair assessment

## Golden rules
1. Clarity beats cleverness
2. Show the human impact
3. A clear argument is often better than a complete argument
4. People are good, systems are complicated
5. Critiques offer paths to better outcomes

## Principles we work by
- Assume good intent
- Needs before wants
- Facts form a strong foundation 
- Feelings _do_ matter
- Systems before individual blame
- Be open to corrections
