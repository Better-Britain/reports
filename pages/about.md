### Bob's profile

I’ve worked in corporate problem‑solving/workflow and software engineering around the UK and in Manchester, and spent much of my time the last decade or so as a tech contractor working mainly on productivity and automation tools, usually through agencies working on infrastructure or civics projects.

I've been somewhat on the left and the right over the years, but don't think a single spectrum captures any person or issue. I have no connections to any political party. I think most people are decent and want things to work out for everyone, despite often not sharing priorities or perspectives. 

When outcomes are bad, it’s _usually_ the incentives and outcomes of bad systems at fault, rather than individuals. The aim is simple: cut through noise, learn about how new tools can help us, de‑radicalise with a focus on identifying the truth, and show where change can happen by sifting the noise to find the nuggets of data that can reasonably inform decisions, big and small.

I welcome feedback and contributors, either on the [Better Britain github repo](https://github.com/Better-Britain) or via email to [admin@betterbritain.org.uk](admin@betterbritain.org.uk).
