### Bob's personal profile

I’ve worked in corporate problem‑solving/workflows and software engineering around the UK and in Manchester, and spent much of my time the last decade or so self-employed as a tech contractor working mainly on productivity and automation tools, usually in agencies working for infrastructure or civics projects. I grew up on a council estate in North Wales, and was diagnosed with Asperger’s early on, which means I tend to think in systems, so in the early internet I spent time around nationalist and conspiratorial spaces, drawn to the anti‑authority tone and pre/proto-gamergate communities and rejection of authority. Friends’ real lives, my own experience working in complex projects, and what I saw of local policing and power kept me firmly in pragmatic reality.

I've been somewhat on the left and the right over the years, but don't think a single spectrum really captures any person or any issue. I have no connections to any political party, I've voted for every major party at least once, and some local fringe ones too, because I think most people are decent and want things to work out for everyone, despite often not sharing priorities or perspectives. When outcomes are bad, it’s _usually_ the incentives and outcomes of bad systems at fault, not individuals.

Better Britain Bureau is my way of turning my strengths into plain, useful reporting: clear facts, human impact, and accountability. I’m pro‑evidence, and open about using AI as a co‑editor/tool to improve clarity and increase throughput, not to replace judgement. The aim is simple: cut through noise, learn about how new tools can help us, de‑radicalise by identifying the truth as clearly as possible, and show where change can happen by identifying the limitations and opportunities of the complex systems that rule our lives.

I welcome feedback and contributors, either on the [Better Britain github repo](https://github.com/Better-Britain) or via email to [admin@betterbritain.org.uk](admin@betterbritain.org.uk).
